Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:
	Each substring is balanced.
Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.
Constraints:
	2 <= s.length <= 1000
	s[i] is either 'L' or 'R'.
	s is a balanced string.
