On an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.
Given an array of integer coordinates queens that represents the positions of the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates king that represent the position of the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can attack the King.
Constraints:
	1 <= queens.length<= 63
	queens[i].length == 2
	0 <= queens[i][j] <8
	king.length == 2
	0 <= king[0], king[1] < 8
	At most one piece is allowed in a cell.
