You are given a rectangular cake of size h x w and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where:
	horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and similarly, and
	verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.
Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo 109 + 7.
Constraints:
	2 <= h, w <= 109
	1 <= horizontalCuts.length <= min(h - 1, 105)
	1 <= verticalCuts.length <= min(w - 1, 105)
	1 <= horizontalCuts[i] < h
	1 <= verticalCuts[i] < w
	All the elements in horizontalCuts are distinct.
	All the elements in verticalCuts are distinct.
