You are given an m x n matrix board, representing the current state of a crossword puzzle. The crossword contains lowercase English letters (from solved words), ' ' to represent any empty cells, and '#' to represent any blocked cells.
A word can be placed horizontally (left to right or right to left) or vertically (top to bottom or bottom to top) in the board if:
	It does not occupy a cell containing the character '#'.
	The cell each letter is placed in must either be ' ' (empty) or match the letter already on the board.
	There must not be any empty cells ' ' or other lowercase letters directly left or right of the word if the word was placed horizontally.
	There must not be any empty cells ' ' or other lowercase letters directly above or below the word if the word was placed vertically.
Given a string word, return true if word can be placed in board, or false otherwise.
Constraints:
	m == board.length
	n == board[i].length
	1 <= m * n <= 2 * 105
	board[i][j] will be ' ', '#', or a lowercase English letter.
	1 <= word.length <= max(m, n)
	word will contain only lowercase English letters.
