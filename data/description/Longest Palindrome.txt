Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindromethat can be built with those letters.
Letters are case sensitive, for example,"Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 2000
	s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase Englishletters only.
