A valid encoding of an array of words is any reference string s and array of indices indices such that:
	words.length == indices.length
	The reference string s ends with the '#' character.
	For each index indices[i], the substring of s starting from indices[i] and up to (but not including) the next '#' character is equal to words[i].
Given an array of words, return the length of the shortest reference string s possible of any valid encoding of words.
Constraints:
	1 <= words.length <= 2000
	1 <= words[i].length <= 7
	words[i] consists of only lowercase letters.
