Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.
Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.
Constraints:
	nums.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
	nums[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.
