An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.
Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.
Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.
Constraints:
	rec1.length == 4
	rec2.length == 4
	-109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109
	rec1 and rec2 represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.
