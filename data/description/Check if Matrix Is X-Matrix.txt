A square matrix is said to be an X-Matrix if both of the following conditions hold:
	All the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are non-zero.
	All other elements are 0.
Given a 2D integer array grid of size n x n representing a square matrix, return true if grid is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return false.
Constraints:
	n == grid.length == grid[i].length
	3 <= n <= 100
	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105
