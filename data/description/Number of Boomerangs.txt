You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
Return the number of boomerangs.
Constraints:
	n == points.length
	1 <= n <= 500
	points[i].length == 2
	-104 <= xi, yi <= 104
	All the points are unique.
