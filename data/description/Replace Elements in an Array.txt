You are given a 0-indexed array nums that consists of n distinct positive integers. Apply m operations to this array, where in the ith operation you replace the number operations[i][0] with operations[i][1].
It is guaranteed that in the ith operation:
	operations[i][0] exists in nums.
	operations[i][1] does not exist in nums.
Return the array obtained after applying all the operations.
Constraints:
	n == nums.length
	m == operations.length
	1 <= n, m <= 105
	All the values of nums are distinct.
	operations[i].length == 2
	1 <= nums[i], operations[i][0], operations[i][1] <= 106
	operations[i][0] will exist in nums when applying the ith operation.
	operations[i][1] will not exist in nums when applying the ith operation.
