You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step, you can select any non-empty sub-array of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.
Return true if you can make arr equal to targetor false otherwise.
Constraints:
	target.length == arr.length
	1 <= target.length <= 1000
	1 <= target[i] <= 1000
	1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
