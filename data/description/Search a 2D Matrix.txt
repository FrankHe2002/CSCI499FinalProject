Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
	Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
	The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Constraints:
	m == matrix.length
	n == matrix[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 100
	-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104
