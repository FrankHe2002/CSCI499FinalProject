You are given a 0-indexed binary string s and two integers minJump and maxJump. In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to '0'. You can move from index i to index j if the following conditions are fulfilled:
	i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), and
	s[j] == '0'.
Return true if you can reach index s.length - 1 in s, or false otherwise.
Constraints:
	2 <= s.length <= 105
	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
	s[0] == '0'
	1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length
