Given an integer array nums, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:
	Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
	left and right are non-empty.
	left has the smallest possible size.
Return the length of left after such a partitioning.
Test cases are generated such that partitioning exists.
Constraints:
	2 <= nums.length <= 105
	0 <= nums[i] <= 106
	There is at least one valid answer for the given input.
