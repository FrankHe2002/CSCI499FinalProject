Given the array houses where houses[i] is the location of the ith house along a street and an integer k, allocate k mailboxes in the street.
Return the minimum total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
Constraints:
	1 <= k <= houses.length <= 100
	1 <= houses[i] <= 104
	All the integers of houses are unique.
