There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.
Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.
The distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.
Constraints:
	n ==colors.length
	2 <= n <= 100
	0 <= colors[i] <= 100
	Test data are generated such that at least two houses have different colors.
