Given an integer array nums with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
Implement the Solution class:
	Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the array nums.
	int pick(int target) Picks a random index i from nums where nums[i] == target. If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
	target is an integer from nums.
	At most 104 calls will be made to pick.
