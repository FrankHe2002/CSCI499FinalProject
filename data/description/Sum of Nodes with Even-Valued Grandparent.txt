Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.
A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.
Constraints:
	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
	1 <= Node.val <= 100
