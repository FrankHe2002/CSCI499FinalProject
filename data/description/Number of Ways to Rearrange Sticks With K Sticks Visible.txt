There are n uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from 1 to n. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly ksticks are visible from the left. A stickis visible from the left if there are no longersticks to the left of it.
	For example, if the sticks are arranged [1,3,2,5,4], then the sticks with lengths 1, 3, and 5 are visible from the left.
Given n and k, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
