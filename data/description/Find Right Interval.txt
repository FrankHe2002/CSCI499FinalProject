You are given an array of intervals, where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] and each starti is unique.
The right interval for an interval i is an interval j such that startj >= endi and startj is minimized. Note that i may equal j.
Return an array of right interval indices for each interval i. If no right interval exists for interval i, then put -1 at index i.
Constraints:
	1 <= intervals.length <= 2 * 104
	intervals[i].length == 2
	-106 <= starti <= endi <= 106
	The start point of each interval is unique.
