You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.
Constraints:
	1 <= k <= n <= 1000

Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?
