You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array nums that is a subset of the linked list values.
Return the number of connected components in nums where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.
Constraints:
	The number of nodes in the linked list is n.
	1 <= n <= 104
	0 <= Node.val < n
	All the values Node.val are unique.
	1 <= nums.length <= n
	0 <= nums[i] < n
	All the values of nums are unique.
