You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths m and n respectively. nums1 and nums2 represent the digits of two numbers. You are also given an integer k.
Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two numbers. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.
Return an array of the k digits representing the answer.
Constraints:
	m == nums1.length
	n == nums2.length
	1 <= m, n <= 500
	0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 9
	1 <= k <= m + n
