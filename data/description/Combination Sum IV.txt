Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up totarget.
The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 200
	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
	All the elements of nums are unique.
	1 <= target <= 1000
