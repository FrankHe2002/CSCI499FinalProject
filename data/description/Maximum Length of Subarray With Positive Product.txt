Given an array of integers nums, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.
A subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of that array.
Return the maximum length of a subarray with positive product.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
