Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
	Search for a node to remove.
	If the node is found, delete the node.
Constraints:
	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
	-105 <= Node.val <= 105
	Each node has a unique value.
	root is a valid binary search tree.
	-105 <= key <= 105
