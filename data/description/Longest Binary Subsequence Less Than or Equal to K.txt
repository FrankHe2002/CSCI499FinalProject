You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.
Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

	The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
	The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
	A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
	1 <= k <= 109
