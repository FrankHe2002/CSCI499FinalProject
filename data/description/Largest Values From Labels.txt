There is a set of n items. You are given two integer arrays values and labels where the value and the label of the ith element are values[i] and labels[i] respectively. You are also given two integers numWanted and useLimit.
Choose a subset s of the n elements such that:
	The size of the subset s is less than or equal to numWanted.
	There are at most useLimit items with the same label in s.
The score of a subset is the sum of the values in the subset.
Return the maximum score of a subset s.
Constraints:
	n == values.length == labels.length
	1 <= n <= 2 * 104
	0 <= values[i], labels[i] <= 2 * 104
	1 <= numWanted, useLimit <= n
