You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.
Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.
Constraints:
	1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104
	0 <= ops.length <= 104
	ops[i].length == 2
	1 <= ai <= m
	1 <= bi <= n
