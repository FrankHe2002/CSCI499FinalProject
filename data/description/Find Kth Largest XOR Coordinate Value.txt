You are given a 2D matrix of size m x n, consisting of non-negative integers. You are also given an integer k.
The value of coordinate (a, b) of the matrix is the XOR of all matrix[i][j] where 0 <= i <= a < m and 0 <= j <= b < n (0-indexed).
Find the kth largest value (1-indexed) of all the coordinates of matrix.
Constraints:
	m == matrix.length
	n == matrix[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 1000
	0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 106
	1 <= k <= m * n
