Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals.
Implement the SummaryRanges class:
	SummaryRanges() Initializes the object with an empty stream.
	void addNum(int val) Adds the integer val to the stream.
	int[][] getIntervals() Returns a summary of the integers in the stream currently as a list of disjoint intervals [starti, endi].
Constraints:
	0 <= val <= 104
	At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to addNum and getIntervals.
