Given an integer array nums and two integers left and right, return the number of contiguous non-empty subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is in the range [left, right].
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	0 <= nums[i] <= 109
	0 <= left <= right <= 109
