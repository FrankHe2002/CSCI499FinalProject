Given an array intervals where intervals[i] = [li, ri] represent the interval [li, ri), remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.
The interval [a, b) is covered by the interval [c, d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.
Return the number of remaining intervals.
Constraints:
	1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
	intervals[i].length == 2
	0 <= li < ri <= 105
	All the given intervals are unique.
