You are given an array of n integers, nums, where there are at most 50 unique values in the array. You are also given an array of m customer order quantities, quantity, where quantity[i] is the amount of integers the ith customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute nums such that:
	The ith customer gets exactly quantity[i] integers,
	The integers the ith customer gets are all equal, and
	Every customer is satisfied.
Return true if it is possible to distribute nums according to the above conditions.
Constraints:
	n == nums.length
	1 <= n <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
	m == quantity.length
	1 <= m <= 10
	1 <= quantity[i] <= 105
	There are at most 50 unique values in nums.
