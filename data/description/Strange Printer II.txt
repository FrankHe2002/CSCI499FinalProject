There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:
	On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.
	Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, the same color cannot be used again.
You are given a m x n matrix targetGrid, where targetGrid[row][col] is the color in the position (row, col) of the grid.
Return true if it is possible to print the matrix targetGrid, otherwise, return false.
Constraints:
	m == targetGrid.length
	n == targetGrid[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 60
	1 <= targetGrid[row][col] <= 60
