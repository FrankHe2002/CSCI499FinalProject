Given two integer arraysarr1 and arr2, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) neededto make arr1 strictly increasing.
In one operation, you can choose two indices0 <=i < arr1.lengthand0 <= j < arr2.lengthand do the assignmentarr1[i] = arr2[j].
If there is no way to makearr1strictly increasing,return-1.
