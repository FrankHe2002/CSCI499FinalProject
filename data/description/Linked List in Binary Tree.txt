Given a binary tree root and alinked list withheadas the first node.
Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the head correspond to some downward path connected in the binary treeotherwise return False.
In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes downwards.
Constraints:
	The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 2500].
	The number of nodes in the list will be in the range [1, 100].
	1 <= Node.val<= 100for each node in the linked list and binary tree.
