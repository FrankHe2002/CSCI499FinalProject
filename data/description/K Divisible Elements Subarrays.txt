Given an integer array nums and two integers k and p, return the number of distinct subarrays which have at most k elements divisible by p.
Two arrays nums1 and nums2 are said to be distinct if:
	They are of different lengths, or
	There exists at least one index i where nums1[i] != nums2[i].
A subarray is defined as a non-empty contiguous sequence of elements in an array.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 200
	1 <= nums[i], p <= 200
	1 <= k <= nums.length

Can you solve this problem in O(n2) time complexity?
