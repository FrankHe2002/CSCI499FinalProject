Given an n x n binary grid, in one step you can choose two adjacent rows of the grid and swap them.
A grid is said to be valid if all the cells above the main diagonal are zeros.
Return the minimum number of steps needed to make the grid valid, or -1 if the grid cannot be valid.
The main diagonal of a grid is the diagonal that starts at cell (1, 1) and ends at cell (n, n).
Constraints:
	n == grid.length == grid[i].length
	1 <= n <= 200
	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1
