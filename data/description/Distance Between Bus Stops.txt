A bushas n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that forma circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops numberi and (i + 1) % n.
The bus goes along both directionsi.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.
Return the shortest distance between the givenstartand destinationstops.
Constraints:
	1 <= n<= 10^4
	distance.length == n
	0 <= start, destination < n
	0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4
