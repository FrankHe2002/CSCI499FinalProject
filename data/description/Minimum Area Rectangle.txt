You are given an array of points in the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi].
Return the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the X and Y axes. If there is not any such rectangle, return 0.
Constraints:
	1 <= points.length <= 500
	points[i].length == 2
	0 <= xi, yi <= 4 * 104
	All the given points are unique.
