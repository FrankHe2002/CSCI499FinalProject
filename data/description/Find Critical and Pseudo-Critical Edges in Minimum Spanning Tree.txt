Given a weighted undirected connected graph with nvertices numbered from 0 to n - 1,and an array edgeswhere edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodesaiand bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cyclesand with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called acritical edge. Onthe other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.
Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
Constraints:
	2 <= n <= 100
	1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)
	edges[i].length == 3
	0 <= ai < bi < n
	1 <= weighti<= 1000
	All pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.
