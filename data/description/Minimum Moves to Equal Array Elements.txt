Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.
In one move, you can increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1.
Constraints:
	n == nums.length
	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
	The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
