Given a non-emptyarray of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You mustimplement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and useonly constantextra space.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
	-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
	Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
