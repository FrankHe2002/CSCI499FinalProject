Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.
Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	0 <= nums[i] <= 106
	1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)
