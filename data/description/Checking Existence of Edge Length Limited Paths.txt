An undirected graph of n nodes is defined by edgeList, where edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi with distance disi. Note that there may be multiple edges between two nodes.
Given an array queries, where queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj], your task is to determine for each queries[j] whether there is a path between pj and qj such that each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than limitj .
Return a boolean array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and the jth value of answer is true if there is a path for queries[j] is true, and false otherwise.
Constraints:
	2 <= n <= 105
	1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 105
	edgeList[i].length == 3
	queries[j].length == 3
	0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n - 1
	ui != vi
	pj != qj
	1 <= disi, limitj <= 109
	There may be multiple edges between two nodes.
