Given an empty set of intervals, implement a data structure that can:
	Add an interval to the set of intervals.
	Count the number of integers that are present in at least one interval.
Implement the CountIntervals class:
	CountIntervals() Initializes the object with an empty set of intervals.
	void add(int left, int right) Adds the interval [left, right] to the set of intervals.
	int count() Returns the number of integers that are present in at least one interval.
Note that an interval [left, right] denotes all the integers x where left <= x <= right.
Constraints:
	1 <= left <= right <= 109
	At most 105 calls in total will be made to add and count.
	At least one call will be made to count.
