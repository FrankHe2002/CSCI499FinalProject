You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k.
Define a pair (u, v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.
Return the k pairs (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk) with the smallest sums.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105
	-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109
	nums1 and nums2 both are sorted in ascending order.
	1 <= k <= 104
