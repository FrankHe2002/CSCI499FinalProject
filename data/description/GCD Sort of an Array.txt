You are given an integer array nums, and you can perform the following operation any number of times on nums:
	Swap the positions of two elements nums[i] and nums[j] if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1 where gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) is the greatest common divisor of nums[i] and nums[j].
Return true if it is possible to sort nums in non-decreasing order using the above swap method, or false otherwise.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
	2 <= nums[i] <= 105
