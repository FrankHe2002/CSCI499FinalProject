Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Constraints:
	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
	-104 <= Node.val <= 104
	All the values in the tree are unique.
	root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
