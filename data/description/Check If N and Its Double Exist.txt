Given an array arr of integers, check if there exists two integers N and M such that N is the double of M ( i.e. N = 2 * M).
More formally check if there existstwo indices i and j such that :
	i != j
	0 <= i, j < arr.length
	arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]
Constraints:
	2 <= arr.length <= 500
	-10^3 <= arr[i] <= 10^3
