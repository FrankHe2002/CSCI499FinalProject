Given an integer array nums (0-indexed) and two integers target and start, find an index i such that nums[i] == target and abs(i - start) is minimized. Note thatabs(x)is the absolute value of x.
Return abs(i - start).
It is guaranteed that target exists in nums.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	1 <= nums[i] <= 104
	0 <= start < nums.length
	target is in nums.
