Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
	0 <= k <= 105

	Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
	Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
