You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.
Constraints:
	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
	Node.val == 0
