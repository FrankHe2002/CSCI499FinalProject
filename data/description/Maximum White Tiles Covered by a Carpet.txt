You are given a 2D integer array tiles where tiles[i] = [li, ri] represents that every tile j in the range li <= j <= ri is colored white.
You are also given an integer carpetLen, the length of a single carpet that can be placed anywhere.
Return the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
Constraints:
	1 <= tiles.length <= 5 * 104
	tiles[i].length == 2
	1 <= li <= ri <= 109
	1 <= carpetLen <= 109
	The tiles are non-overlapping.
