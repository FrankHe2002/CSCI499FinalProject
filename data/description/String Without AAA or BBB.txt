Given two integers a and b, return any string s such that:
	s has length a + b and contains exactly a 'a' letters, and exactly b 'b' letters,
	The substring 'aaa' does not occur in s, and
	The substring 'bbb' does not occur in s.
Constraints:
	0 <= a, b <= 100
	It is guaranteed such an s exists for the given a and b.
