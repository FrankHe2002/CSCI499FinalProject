A super ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are in the array primes.
Given an integer n and an array of integers primes, return the nth super ugly number.
The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
Constraints:
	1 <= n <= 105
	1 <= primes.length <= 100
	2 <= primes[i] <= 1000
	primes[i] is guaranteed to be a prime number.
	All the values of primes are unique and sorted in ascending order.
