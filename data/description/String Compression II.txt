Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works byreplacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string"aabccc"we replace "aa"by"a2"and replace "ccc"by"c3". Thus the compressed string becomes "a2bc3".
Notice that in this problem, we are not adding'1'after single characters.
Given astring sand an integer k. You need to delete at mostk characters fromssuch that the run-length encoded version of shas minimum length.
Find the minimum length of the run-length encodedversion of s after deleting at most k characters.
