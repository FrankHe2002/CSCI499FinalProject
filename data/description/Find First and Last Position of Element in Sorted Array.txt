Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
You mustwrite an algorithm withO(log n) runtime complexity.
Constraints:
	0 <= nums.length <= 105
	-109<= nums[i]<= 109
	nums is a non-decreasing array.
	-109<= target<= 109
