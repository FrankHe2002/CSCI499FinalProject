Given a wordlist, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.
For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:
	Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.
Constraints:
	1 <= wordlist.length, queries.length <= 5000
	1 <= wordlist[i].length, queries[i].length <= 7
	wordlist[i] and queries[i] consist only of only English letters.
