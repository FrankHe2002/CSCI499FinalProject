You are given a string s formed by digits and '#'. We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:
	Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
	Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.
Return the string formed after mapping.
The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s consists of digits and the '#' letter.
	s will be a valid string such that mapping is always possible.
