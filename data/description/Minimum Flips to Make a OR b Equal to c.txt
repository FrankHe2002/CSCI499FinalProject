Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make (a OR b == c). (bitwise OR operation).
Flip operationconsists of changeanysingle bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1in their binary representation.
Constraints:
	1 <= a <= 10^9
	1 <= b<= 10^9
	1 <= c<= 10^9
