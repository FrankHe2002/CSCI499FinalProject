Given an integer array nums whereevery element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
You mustimplement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and useonly constantextra space.
Constraints:
	1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
	Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
