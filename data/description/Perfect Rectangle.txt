Given an array rectangles where rectangles[i] = [xi, yi, ai, bi] represents an axis-aligned rectangle. The bottom-left point of the rectangle is (xi, yi) and the top-right point of it is (ai, bi).
Return true if all the rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
Constraints:
	1 <= rectangles.length <= 2 * 104
	rectangles[i].length == 4
	-105 <= xi, yi, ai, bi <= 105
