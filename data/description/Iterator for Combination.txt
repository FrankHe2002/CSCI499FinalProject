Design the CombinationIterator class:
	CombinationIterator(string characters, int combinationLength) Initializes the object with a string characters of sorted distinct lowercase English letters and a number combinationLength as arguments.
	next() Returns the next combination of length combinationLength in lexicographical order.
	hasNext() Returns true if and only if there exists a next combination.
Constraints:
	1 <= combinationLength <= characters.length <= 15
	All the characters of characters are unique.
	At most 104 calls will be made to next and hasNext.
	It is guaranteed that all calls of the function next are valid.
