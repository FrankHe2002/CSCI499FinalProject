You are given coordinates, a string that represents the coordinates of a square of the chessboard. Below is a chessboard for your reference.
Return true if the square is white, and false if the square is black.
The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. The coordinate will always have the letter first, and the number second.
Constraints:
	coordinates.length == 2
	'a' <= coordinates[0] <= 'h'
	'1' <= coordinates[1] <= '8'
