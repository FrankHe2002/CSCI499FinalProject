A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
Design an algorithm to insert a new node to a complete binary tree keeping it complete after the insertion.
Implement the CBTInserter class:
	CBTInserter(TreeNode root) Initializes the data structure with the root of the complete binary tree.
	int insert(int v) Inserts a TreeNode into the tree with value Node.val == val so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted TreeNode.
	TreeNode get_root() Returns the root node of the tree.
Constraints:
	The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
	0 <= Node.val <= 5000
	root is a complete binary tree.
	0 <= val <= 5000
	At most 104 calls will be made to insert and get_root.
