You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:
	i < j < k,
	nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
	nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.
Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.
Constraints:
	3 <= nums.length <= 200
	0 <= nums[i] <= 200
	1 <= diff <= 50
	nums is strictly increasing.
