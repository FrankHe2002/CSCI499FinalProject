You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.
Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.
The blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:
Build the result list and return its head.
Constraints:
	3 <= list1.length <= 104
	1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1
	1 <= list2.length <= 104
