Given adirected acyclic graph,withnvertices numbered from0ton-1,and an arrayedgeswhereedges[i] = [fromi, toi]represents a directed edge from nodefromito nodetoi.
Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.
Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
Constraints:
	2 <= n <= 10^5
	1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)
	edges[i].length == 2
	0 <= fromi,toi < n
	All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.
