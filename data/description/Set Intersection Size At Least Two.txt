An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a < b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.
Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has a size of at least two.
Constraints:
	1 <= intervals.length <= 3000
	intervals[i].length == 2
	0 <= ai <bi <= 108
