You are given a string s, and an array of pairs of indices in the stringpairswherepairs[i] =[a, b]indicates 2 indices(0-indexed) of the string.
You canswap the characters at any pair of indices in the givenpairsany number of times.
Return thelexicographically smallest string that scan be changed to after using the swaps.
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 10^5
	0 <= pairs.length <= 10^5
	0 <= pairs[i][0], pairs[i][1] <s.length
	sonly contains lower case English letters.
