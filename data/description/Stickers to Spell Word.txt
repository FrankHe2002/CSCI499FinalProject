We are given n different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.
You would like to spell out the given string target by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.
Return the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out target. If the task is impossible, return -1.
Constraints:
	n == stickers.length
	1 <= n <= 50
	1 <= stickers[i].length <= 10
	1 <= target.length <= 15
	stickers[i] and target consist of lowercase English letters.
