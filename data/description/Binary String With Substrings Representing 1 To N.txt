Given a binary string s and a positive integer n, return true if the binary representation of all the integers in the range [1, n] are substrings of s, or false otherwise.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
	1 <= n <= 109
