Bug type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
Upon reviewing the code, we can see that there are some inconsistencies in the logic. The code tries to distribute the watering between Alice and Bob, making them refill their watering cans when necessary. However, there are several issues:
1. The loop condition `start <= plants.length/2 && end >= plants.length/2` treats the middle plant differently if the total number of plants is odd. This distinction is incorrect because both Alice and Bob can water the middle plant if they have enough water.
2. The refilling of the watering cans is not accurately implemented. The code subtracts the amount of water needed to water a plant from the respective watering can, but it doesn't refill the cans to their full capacity after every watering.
3. The final if-else condition with `plants.length % 2 != 0` is incorrect. It should check if the total number of plants is odd (i.e., `plants.length % 2 == 1`) rather than `plants.length % 2 != 0`.
4. The conditions `(c1 > c2 || c1 == c2)` and `c1 < c2` in the if-else statement are redundant because the code has already ensured that c1 and c2 are different before reaching that point.

Fix:
To fix these issues, we need to modify the logic of the code:
1. Remove the distinction for the middle plant.
2. Refill the watering cans to their full capacity after each watering.
3. Fix the condition to check for an odd number of plants (`plants.length % 2 == 1`).
4. Simplify the if-else statement to check that c1 and c2 are different.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumRefill(int[] plants, int capacityA, int capacityB) {
        int count = 0;
        int c1 = capacityA;
        int c2 = capacityB;

        for (int start = 0, end = plants.length - 1; start <= end; start++, end--) {
            if (c1 >= plants[start]) {
                c1 -= plants[start];
            } else {
                count++;
                c1 = capacityA - plants[start];
            }
            
            if (c2 >= plants[end]) {
                c2 -= plants[end];
            } else {
                count++;
                c2 = capacityB - plants[end];
            }
        }
        
        if (plants.length % 2 == 1) {
            if (plants[plants.length / 2] > c1) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
