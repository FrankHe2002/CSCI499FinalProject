There seems to be a bug in the second for loop where the condition for the loop is incorrect. Currently, it is `for (int i = 0; i >= n - 1; i++)` which means the loop will only execute if `i` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. However, we want the loop to execute as long as `i` is less than `n-1`.

To fix this, we need to change the condition in the for loop from `i >= n - 1` to `i <= n - 1`. This will ensure that the loop iterates until `i` reaches `n - 1` and includes all the elements of the array.

The corrected code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] arr = s.replaceAll("\\s{2,}", " ").split(" ");
        // splitting based on while spaces by replaceing spaces by single gap 
        int n = arr.length;
        String temp = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[n - i - 1];
            arr[n - i - 1] = temp;
        }
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - 1; i++) {
            result += arr[i] + " ";
        }
        result += arr[n - 1];
        return result.trim();

    }
}
```

This fix ensures that all the words in the array are included in the final `result` string.
