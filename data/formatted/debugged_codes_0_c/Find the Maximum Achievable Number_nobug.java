The provided Java code does not have any bugs. It is a simple solution that calculates the result by multiplying `t` by 2 and adding it to `num`.

To identify and fix a bug, we typically need to look for any logic errors, syntax errors, or runtime errors. In this case, the code is very straightforward and does not contain any complex logic or calculations, so it is unlikely to have bugs.

The code returns the result by multiplying `t` by 2 and adding it to `num`. This logic is correct and there are no syntax errors. Additionally, the solution has a runtime of 1 ms and a memory usage of 40.61 MB, which are both efficient.

Since there are no bugs in the provided code, no changes need to be made. The code can be considered correct as it is.
