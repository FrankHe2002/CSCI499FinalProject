Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The code aims to find the number of reachable nodes given a graph of edges and a maximum number of moves.
2. The code starts by initializing a 2D graph array and filling it with -1 values.
3. Then, it populates the graph array based on the input edges array.
4. Next, the code initializes a priority queue "heap" to store the nodes to visit, sorted by their maximum moves remaining.
5. The code then initializes the answer variable to 0 and a boolean array "vis" to keep track of visited nodes.
6. It adds the starting node to the heap with its maximum moves remaining.
7. The code enters a while loop until the heap is empty.
8. Inside the loop, it pops the node with the maximum moves remaining from the heap.
9. If the node is already visited, it continues to the next iteration.
10. Otherwise, it marks the node as visited and increments the answer counter.
11. Then, for each adjacent node to the current node, it checks if there is an edge between them.
12. If there is an edge and the adjacent node is not visited, and the maximum moves remaining is not enough to reach the adjacent node, it adds the adjacent node to the heap with the updated maximum moves remaining.
13. It also calculates the moves taken to reach the adjacent node and subtracts the moves from the graph edge values. It updates the answer counter accordingly.
14. Finally, it returns the answer counter.

Bug:
The bug in the code lies in the condition to check if the maximum moves remaining is not enough to reach the adjacent node (line 40).
The code should check if maxMovesRemaining < graph[nearestNodeId][i] + 1 instead of maxMovesRemaining <= graph[nearestNodeId][i] + 1.

Fix:
Change the condition on line 40 from:
```
if (!vis[i] && maxMovesRemaining <= graph[nearestNodeId][i] + 1)
```
to:
```
if (!vis[i] && maxMovesRemaining < graph[nearestNodeId][i] + 1)
```

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 429 ms (Top 10.68%) | Memory: 270.9 MB (Top 16.79%)
class Solution {
    public int reachableNodes(int[][] edges, int maxMoves, int n) {
        int[][] graph = new int[n][n];
