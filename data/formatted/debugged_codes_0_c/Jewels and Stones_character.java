Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning:
- The code seems to have a syntax error in the second for loop.
- The closing parenthesis ")" is missing after "length" in the declaration of the for loop.

Fix:
- Add the closing parenthesis after "length" in the second for loop.

Revised Code:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 31.57%) | Memory: 42.7 MB (Top 19.07%)
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        HashSet<Character> hs = new HashSet<>();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < jewels.length(); i++) {
            hs.add(jewels.charAt(i));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < stones.length(); i++) { // Fix: Added closing parenthesis
            if (hs.contains(stones.charAt(i)))
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
