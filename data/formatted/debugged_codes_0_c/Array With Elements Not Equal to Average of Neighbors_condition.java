Bug Type: Infinite Loop

Reasoning Process:
1. The for loop condition is `i >= nums.length - 1`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `nums.length - 1`.
2. The loop variable `i` is initialized as 0.
3. Since the loop condition is `i >= nums.length - 1`, and `nums.length - 1` is the index of the last element in the array, the loop should terminate when `i` becomes greater than or equal to `nums.length - 1`.
4. However, the loop increment is `i += 2`, which means `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.
5. In the provided code, the loop condition should be `i <= nums.length - 2` instead of `i >= nums.length - 1` to ensure that the loop terminates when `i` becomes greater than or equal to `nums.length - 2`, which is the last even index in the array.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 67 ms (Top 33.85%) | Memory: 147.3 MB (Top 73.33%)
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // sort in wave format
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums.length - 2; i += 2) {
            int temp = nums[i];
            nums[i] = nums[i + 1];
            nums[i + 1] = temp;
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```
