The bug in the provided code lies in the if condition inside the while loop. The condition is checking if `nums[the]` is greater than `nums[mid + 1]`, but there is no variable named `the` in the code. This is a compilation error.

To fix the bug, we should change `nums[the]` to `nums[mid]` in the if condition.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                // It means that we are in the decreasing part of the array
                end = mid;
            } else {
                // It means that we are in the increasing part of the array
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```
