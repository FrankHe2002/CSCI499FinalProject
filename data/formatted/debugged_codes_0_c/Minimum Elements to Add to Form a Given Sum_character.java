Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The goal of this code is to calculate the minimum number of elements needed to be added to or subtracted from the array 'nums' in order to make the sum equal to the 'goal'.
2. The code calculates the difference between the sum of 'nums' and the 'goal', and then divides this difference by 'limit'.
3. If there is a remainder after the division, it adds 1 to the result, otherwise it adds 0.
4. However, the code does not consider the case where the remainder is exactly 0, but the difference is non-zero.
5. In such a case, the code should add 1 to the result, because even though the remainder is 0, there is still a need to change at least one element to make the sum equal to the 'goal'.

Fix:
To fix the bug and correctly handle the case where the remainder is exactly 0 but the difference is non-zero, we can modify the code to add 1 to the result if the remainder is greater than or equal to 0, instead of just checking if it is greater than 0.

Updated code:
```java

class Solution {
    public int minElements(int[] nums, int limit, int goal) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums)
            sum += num;
        long diff = Math.abs(sum - goal);
        return (int) (diff / limit) + (diff % limit >= 0 ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
