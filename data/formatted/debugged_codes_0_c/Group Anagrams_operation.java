After reviewing the code, it seems that there is no bug in terms of syntax or logical errors. The code is a correct implementation of the "groupAnagrams" function, which groups anagrams together in a list of strings.

The reasoning process followed to identify the bug is as follows:
1. Checked for syntax errors: There are no syntax errors in the code.
2. Checked for logical errors: There does not seem to be any logical error in the code.
3. Analyzed the code flow: The code flows correctly, iterating through each string, sorting its characters, and building a key for the hashmap using the sorted characters.
4. Verified the output: The code prints the hashmap correctly, indicating that the grouping of anagrams is working as expected.

However, there is some room for improvement in the code. The current version creates a new StringBuilder for each string and converts it to a string using "toString" method. Instead, we can directly use the sorted char array to create a string using the constructor of the String class.

Here is the modified code with the optimization described above:
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> hm = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            char[] ch = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(ch);
            String str = new String(ch);
            if (hm.containsKey(str)) {
                ArrayList<String> temp = hm.get(str);
                temp.add(s);
                hm.put(str, temp);
            } else {
                ArrayList<String> temp = new ArrayList<>();
                temp.add(s);
                hm.put(str, temp);
            }
        }
        List<List<String>> res = new ArrayList<>(hm.values());
        return res;
    }
}
```
