Bug type: Ordering bug in PriorityQueue

Reasoning process:
1. The code is attempting to find the nth super ugly number.
2. It uses a dynamic programming approach to store previously calculated super ugly numbers.
3. It uses a priority queue to maintain the next smallest super ugly number.
4. The priority queue is initialized with pairs representing the prime number, the pointer to the current super ugly number generated by that prime, and the value of the current super ugly number.
5. The priority queue is sorted based on the value of the super ugly number.
6. The code loops until it reaches the nth position in the dynamic programming array.
7. In each iteration, it removes the smallest super ugly number from the priority queue.
8. If the removed super ugly number is different from the last super ugly number in the dp array, it stores it in the next position in the dp array.
9. It multiplies each prime number by the next super ugly number generated by that prime, and adds it to the priority queue.
10. It continues this process until it reaches the nth position in the dp array.
11. Finally, it returns the nth super ugly number.

Identifying the bug:
The bug lies in the implementation of the `compareTo()` method in the `Pair` class, which is used to determine the ordering of the pairs in the priority queue.
The implementation `return this.val % o.val;` is incorrect.
Two pairs should be considered equal if their values are equal, and if their values are different, the pair with the smaller value should be considered smaller.
So the correct implementation should be `return Integer.compare(this.val, o.val);`

Fixing the bug:
1. Change the implementation of the `compareTo()` method in the `Pair` class to `return Integer.compare(this.val, o.val);`
2. Comment out the second solution implementation to only focus on fixing the bug in the first solution.

Fixed code in markdown:
```java
//---------------------O(nlogk)-------------------------

class Solution {
    public int nthSuperUglyNumber(int n, int[] primes) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1;

        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < primes.length; i++) {
            pq.add(new Pair(primes[i], 1, primes[i]));
        }

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ) {
            Pair curr = pq.remove();
