### Bug Type: Logic Error

### Reasoning:

1. The code loops through each character in the input string `s` starting from index `1`.
2. It checks if the current character is the same as the previous character (`prev`).
3. If it is the same, it increments `freq` by 1.
4. If it is different, it updates `prev` to the new character and resets `freq` to 1.
5. After that, it checks if `freq` is less than 3.
6. If it is, it appends the current character to the result string `res`.
7. Finally, it returns the result string.

The bug in the code lies in the condition `freq < 3` when appending characters to `res`. The objective is to remove consecutive occurrences of a character if there are more than 2 occurrences. However, the condition `freq < 3` would allow up to 2 occurrences to be appended to `res` instead of only one occurrence.

For example, if the input string is "aaabbb":
- The first 'a' will be appended to `res` since `freq` is 1.
- The second 'a' will also be appended to `res` since `freq` is 2.
- The third 'a' is skipped since `freq` is 3, but it should only be appended once.

### Fix:

To fix the issue, we need to change the condition `freq < 3` to `freq <= 2`. This will ensure that only one occurrence is appended to `res` for each character.

```java
class Solution {
    public String makeFancyString(String s) {
        char prev = s.charAt(0);
        int freq = 1;
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        res.append(s.charAt(0));
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == prev)
                freq++;
            else {
                prev = s.charAt(i);
                freq = 1;
            }
            if (freq <= 2) // Updated condition
                res.append(s.charAt(i));
        }
        return res.toString();
    }
}
```
