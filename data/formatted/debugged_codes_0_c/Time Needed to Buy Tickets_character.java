There are a few bugs in the provided Java code:

1. Missing semicolon: In the line `int n = tickets.length`, there is a missing semicolon at the end of the line.

2. Infinite loop: The while loop `while (tickets[k] > 0)` will result in an infinite loop if `tickets[k]` is not updated inside the loop. This is because there is no code inside the loop to decrease the value of `tickets[k]`. To fix this, we can add `tickets[k]--;` inside the while loop.

3. Index out of bounds: The line `if (tickets[k] == 1) return k + 1;` may throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `tickets`. To fix this, we need to check if `k` is a valid index before accessing `tickets[k]`. We can add a condition `if (k < tickets.length && tickets[k] == 1) return k + 1;` before the while loop.

4. Incorrect decrement of `k`: The line `k--;` should be placed inside the while loop, after the for loop. This will ensure that `k` is decremented only when the for loop completes its execution.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 62.6%) | Memory: 40.11 MB (Top 61.2%)

class Solution {
    public int timeRequiredToBuy(int[] tickets, int k) {
        int n = tickets.length;
        int time = 0;

        if (k < tickets.length && tickets[k] == 1) return k + 1;
        while (tickets[k] > 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (tickets[i] == 0) continue;
                tickets[i] = tickets[i] - 1;
                time++;
                if (tickets[k] == 0) break;
            }
            k--;
        }
        return time;
    }
}
```
