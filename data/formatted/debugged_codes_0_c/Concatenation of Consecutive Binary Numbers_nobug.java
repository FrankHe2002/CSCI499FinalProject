The bug in the provided code is that it is using the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the exponentiation of 2. The `Math.pow()` function returns a `double` value, and casting it to an `int` leads to loss of precision. This can cause incorrect results when calculating the length of the binary string.

To fix this bug, we can replace the usage of `Math.pow()` with a left shift operator to calculate the exponentiation of 2.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 22 ms (Top 93.22%) | Memory: 39 MB (Top 77.92%)
class Solution {
    public int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            res = (res << Integer.toBinaryString(i).length()) + i;
            res %= 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```

In this modified code, we use the left shift operator (`<<`) to calculate the exponentiation of 2. This is equivalent to multiplying the current value of `res` by 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of `i`. Then we add `i` to the result, and take the modulo `1000000007` to ensure the result stays within the desired range.

The revised code should now correctly calculate the concatenated binary string and return the expected result.
