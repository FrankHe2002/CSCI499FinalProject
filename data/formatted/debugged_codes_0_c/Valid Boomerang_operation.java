The provided Java code calculates the area between three points to determine if they form a boomerang. The bug in the code lies in the calculation of the area.

The calculation for the area is incorrect. The expression `0.5 % ((a * d) - (b * c))` should be `0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c))`. The modulus operator `%` is used instead of the multiplication operator `*`, resulting in an incorrect area calculation.

To fix the bug, the expression `0.5 % ((a * d) - (b * c))` should be changed to `0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c))`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 58.12%) | Memory: 42.3 MB (Top 12.94%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isBoomerang(int[][] points) {
        double a, b, c, d, area;
        a = points[0][0] - points[1][0];
        b = points[1][0] - points[2][0];
        c = points[0][1] - points[1][1];
        d = points[1][1] - points[2][1];  
        area = 0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c));
        return area != 0;
    }
}
```

With this change, the code should correctly calculate the area between the points and determine if they form a boomerang or not.
