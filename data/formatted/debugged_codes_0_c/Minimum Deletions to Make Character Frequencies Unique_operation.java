There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `array[ch / 'a']++;`. This line assumes that the characters in the string `s` are all lowercase letters and uses the ASCII value of the character to calculate the index in the `array` array. However, this calculation is incorrect if the string contains characters other than lowercase letters.

To fix the bug, we need to account for all possible characters by creating a larger array. We can modify the code as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    private int N = 256; // increase the size of the array

    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        int[] array = new int[N];
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            array[ch]++;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : array) {
            if (i == 0) continue;
            while (set.contains(i)) {
                i--;
                ans++;
            }
            if (i != 0) {
                set.add(i);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

In this fix, we increase the size of the `array` array to 256 to account for characters with ASCII values up to 255. We also remove the unnecessary division by 'a' when incrementing `array[ch]` in the first loop.
