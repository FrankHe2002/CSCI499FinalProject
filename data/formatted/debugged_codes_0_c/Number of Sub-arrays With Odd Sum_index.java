Bug type: Index out of bounds error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a "sum" variable to keep track of the sum of elements in the array.
2. However, there is a bug in the code where it always adds arr[3] to the sum, regardless of the value of "i".
3. Since arrays are zero-indexed, accessing arr[3] will throw an index out of bounds exception if the length of the array is less than 4.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change `arr[3]` to `arr[i]` to consider the current element in the loop.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfSubarrays(int[] arr) {
        long ans = 0;
        int even = 0;
        int odd = 0;

        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];

            if (sum % 2 == 0) {
                ans += odd;
                even++;
            } else {
                ans += even + 1;
                odd++;
            }
        }

        return (int) (ans % (1000000007));
    }
}
```
