The bug in the provided Java code is that the count variable is initialized to 0, but it is never incremented or updated inside the for loop. As a result, the count always remains 0 and the method returns an incorrect count of vowels in the word.

To fix this bug, we need to increment the count variable inside the if condition whenever a vowel is encountered. The updated code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 23 ms (Top 33.08%) | Memory: 50 MB (Top 44.62%)
class Solution {

    boolean isVowel(char ch) {
        return ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'u';
    }

    public long countVowels(String word) {
        long count = 0;
        int len = word.length();

        for (int pos = 0; pos < len; pos++) {
            if (isVowel(word.charAt(pos))) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

In the updated code, the count variable is incremented by 1 each time a vowel is encountered. This ensures that the count correctly reflects the number of vowels in the word.
