Bug type: Index out of bounds

Explanation:

In the given code, the bug exists in the for loop condition where we are checking the index of array g, but then accessing the arrays g and s using the index i and j respectively. 

This will lead to accessing the elements of the array s beyond its length and eventually result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the for loop condition to check the indices of arrays g and s.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < g.length && j < s.length) {
            if (g[i] <= s[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```

In the above code, I have added a separate initialization for the index j and changed the for loop to a while loop. Inside the loop, I have incremented the index j in every iteration. I have also added a condition to check if g[i] is less than or equal to s[j]. If true, then increment i. By doing this, we can iterate through both arrays properly without going out of bounds.
