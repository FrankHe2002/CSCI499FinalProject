Bug Type: Logic Error

There is a bug in the code that may result in incorrect output. The bug lies in the condition used to check if the points form a valid rectangle:

```java
boolean isRectangle = map.get(x1).contains(y2) && map.get(x2).contains(y1);
```

The bug occurs because the condition checks for the presence of `y2` in `x1` and `y1` in `x2`. However, this condition does not guarantee that the points form a valid rectangle. It only checks if the pair of points (`x1`, `y2`) and (`x2`, `y1`) are present in the given points, but it doesn't consider the diagonal points (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`).

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the diagonal points are present in the given points as well. The corrected condition should be:

```java
boolean isRectangle = map.get(x1).contains(y2) && map.get(x2).contains(y1) && map.get(x1).contains(y1) && map.get(x2).contains(y2);
```

By including these additional checks, we ensure that all four points required to form a valid rectangle are present in the given points.

Here is the code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {

    public int minAreaRect(int[][] points) {

        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Group the points by x coordinates
        for (int[] point : points) {
            if (!map.containsKey(point[0])) map.put(point[0], new HashSet<>());
            map.get(point[0]).add(point[1]);
        }

        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {

            int x1 = points[i][0];
            int y1 = points[i][1];
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
                int x2 = points[j][0];
                int y2 = points[j][1];
                if (x1 == x2 || y1 == y2) // We are looking for diagonal point, so if j is neighbour point, then continue
                    continue;

                // Note - We are calculating area first (before checking whether these points form the correct rectangle), because
                // cost of
