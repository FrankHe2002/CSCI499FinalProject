Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:

1. The code is supposed to find self-dividing numbers between the range left and right, inclusive.
2. The selfDividingNumbers() method iterates through each number in the range and calls the fun() method.
3. The fun() method checks if the number is self-dividing by checking if it is divisible by each of its digits.
4. However, there is a logical error in the fun() method. The variable 'y' is assigned a value of k + 10, which does not make sense in the context of checking if a number is divisible by its digits.
5. Division of k by 10 should be done outside the if condition.
6. Additionally, the condition 'y == 0' will never be true since 'y' is always k + 10, and 'k' is a positive integer.

Fix:

The fix involves moving the division of k by 10 before the if condition in the fun() method.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> selfDividingNumbers(int left, int right) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (left <= right) {
            if (fun(left))
                ans.add(left);
            left++;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    boolean fun(int x) {
        int k = x;
        while (k > 0) {
            k = k / 10;
            int y = k % 10;
            if (y == 0 || x % y != 0)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
