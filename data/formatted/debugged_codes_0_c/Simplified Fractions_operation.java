The code appears to have a logical bug. 
The method `simplifiedFractions` is supposed to generate simplified fractions in the form of "numerator/denominator" where the numerator and denominator are both positive integers less than or equal to `n`. However, the outer for loop starts with `numerator = 1` and iterates until `numerator < n`, excluding `n` itself. This means that the largest possible numerator is `n - 1`. In the inner for loop, the denominator starts with `numerator + 1` and iterates until `denominator <= n`, which includes `n` itself. This means that the denominator can be equal to `n`, but the numerator cannot be equal to `n`. As a result, the fraction `n/n` is not considered, even though it is a valid fraction according to the problem requirements.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the outer for loop to `numerator <= n`. This ensures that the numerator can take the value of `n`, allowing us to generate the fraction `n/n`. 

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> simplifiedFractions(int n) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int numerator = 1; numerator <= n; numerator++) {
            for (int denominator = numerator + 1; denominator <= n; denominator++) {
                if (gcd(numerator, denominator) == 1) {
                    list.add(numerator + "/" + denominator);
                }
            }
        }
        return list;
    }

    static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (a == 0) {
            return b;
        }
        return gcd(b % a, a);
    }
}
```

The logical bug has been fixed by changing the condition in the outer for loop from `numerator < n` to `numerator <= n`.
