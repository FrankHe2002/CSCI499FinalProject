In order to identify and fix any potential bug in this code, we need to carefully review the logic and understand the purpose of each line.

Upon reviewing the code, here are the potential bugs and their fixes:

1. Bug: The code tries to check if the given range (left to right) contains a majority element. However, it doesn't handle the case when the given range is empty (left > right).
   Fix: To fix this bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the `query` method to return -1 if `left` is greater than `right`.

2. Bug: The code has a potential logical error in line 36, where it computes the value of `ans`.
   Fix: Change `ans = (ans >< 1) + b;` to `ans = (ans << 1) + b;`. This will correctly compute the value of `ans` by shifting it one bit to the left and then adding the value of `b`.

3. Bug: The code tries to find the floor of a given value in a sorted list, but the current implementation returns the index of the element smaller than or equal to the given value, instead of just the index of the element smaller than the given value.
   Fix: Modify the `floor` method to return `left - 1` instead of `right` when exiting the while loop. This will correctly return the index of the element smaller than the given value.

Here is the corrected code:

    private final int digits = 15;

    public MajorityChecker(int[] arr) {
        int len = arr.length;
        presum = new int[len + 1][digits];
        pos = new ArrayList[20001];

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            int n = arr[i];
            if (pos[n] == null) pos[n] = new ArrayList();
            pos[n].add(i);

            for (int j = 0; j < digits; j++) {
                presum[i + 1][j] = presum[i][j] + (n & 1);
                n >>= 1;
            }
        }
