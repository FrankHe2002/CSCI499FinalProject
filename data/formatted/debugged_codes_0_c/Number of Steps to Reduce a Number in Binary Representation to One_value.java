Bug type: Off-by-one error

Explanation: The code starts the loop from `s.length() - 1` and goes until `i >= 1`. This means that the loop doesn't include the first character of the string. However, the problem statement requires counting the number of steps needed to convert the entire string. Therefore, the loop should start from `s.length() - 1` and go until `i >= 0`.

To fix the bug, the loop condition should be modified to `i >= 0`. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSteps(String s) {
        int countSteps = 0;
        int carry = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { // fix: modify loop condition
            int rightMostBit = s.charAt(i) - '0';
            if ((rightMostBit + carry) == 1) {
                carry = 1;
                countSteps += 4;
            } else {
                countSteps++;
            }
        }
        return countSteps + carry;
    }
}
```
