Bug type: Infinite loop

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a priority queue to store the elements from `nums2` along with their indices. The elements are sorted in descending order of their values.
2. The code then uses a while loop to assign values from `nums1` to `nums2` based on the maximum value in the priority queue.
3. The loop continues until `left` becomes greater than `right`.
4. However, there is no condition to break out of the loop, which can lead to an infinite loop if the values in `nums2` are not present in `nums1`.
5. The loop should break when the priority queue is empty.

Fix:
Add a condition to break out of the loop when the priority queue is empty. 

```java
while (left <= right && !pq.isEmpty()) {
    // existing code
}
```
