### Bug Type: Logical Error

### Reasoning:
- The code is implementing the solution for the N-Queens problem using backtracking.
- The algorithm uses three boolean arrays, `col`, `diag`, and `rdiag`, to keep track of the columns and diagonals in which queens are placed.
- `col` array is used to mark the columns occupied by queens.
- `diag` array is used to mark the diagonals (\) occupied by queens.
- `rdiag` array is used to mark the reverse diagonals (/) occupied by queens.
- The algorithm starts by placing a queen in the first row and recursively checks for possible placements in the subsequent rows.
- For each row, it iterates over the columns and checks if a queen can be placed in that column. If it can, it marks the column and the diagonals, and recursively moves to the next row.
- If the placement is not valid, it backtracks by unmarking the column and the diagonals and tries the next column.
- The base case for the recursion is when all rows have been filled, in which case a valid solution is found and the `count` is incremented.
- The algorithm returns the final count of valid solutions.

### Identifying the Bug:
- Upon initial inspection, the code appears to be correct and efficient. It's important to analyze the code and understand the problem it's solving before making any assumptions.
- However, upon closer inspection, there is a logical error in the condition check for placing a queen in a column.
- In the condition `rdiag[r - c + n - 1] != false`, the intention is to check if the reverse diagonal (/) is not occupied by a queen. However, the condition checking is incorrect because it uses the inequality operator (!=) with a comparison to false.
- The correct condition should be `rdiag[r - c + n - 1] == false`.

### Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the incorrect condition check in the `if` statement needs to be corrected to `rdiag[r - c + n - 1] == false`.
- Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 98.59%) | Memory: 41.2 MB (Top 48.22%)
class Solution {
    int count = 0;

    public int totalNQueens(int n) {
        boolean col[] = new boolean[n];
