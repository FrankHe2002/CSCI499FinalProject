There is a bug in the provided Java code. 

The bug occurs in the line `int c = s.charAt(i);`. The `charAt()` method returns a character, but the variable `c` is declared as an integer. This will result in incorrect bitwise computation when XOR operation is performed between an integer `mask` and a character `c`. 

To fix this bug, the variable `c` should be declared as a character instead of an integer.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int res = 0, mask = 0, n = s.length();
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();// key--> Mask, value--> Index
        seen.put(0, - 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++ i) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'a' || s.charAt(i) == 'e' || s.charAt(i) == 'i' || s.charAt(i) == 'o' || s.charAt(i) == 'u') { // check only vowels and skip consonant
                char c = s.charAt(i); // fix: declare c as character
                mask = mask ^ c;
                seen.putIfAbsent(mask, i);
            }
            res = Math.max(res, i - seen.get(mask));
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

By declaring `c` as a character, the bug is fixed. The code now correctly performs the bitwise computation with the `mask` variable.
