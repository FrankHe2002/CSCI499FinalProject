The Java code is calculating the maximum product of two elements in the given array. 

Upon reviewing the code, I found a bug in the line `nums[maxi] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;`. This line is replacing the maximum number in the array with `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which may affect the calculation of `nextmax` in the following loop.

To fix this bug, I would suggest initializing `maxi` with 0 instead of -1, as the array index starts from 0. Also, I would modify the condition in the second loop to exclude the index `maxi` when calculating `nextmax`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxi = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++ i) {
            if (nums[i] > max) {
                max = nums[i];
                maxi = i;
            }
        }
        int nextmax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++ i) {
            if (i != maxi && nums[i] > nextmax) nextmax = nums[i];
        }
        return max * nextmax - max - nextmax + 1;
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that the correct `nextmax` value is calculated without including the index `maxi` in the calculation.
