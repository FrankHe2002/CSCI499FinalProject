Bug type: Syntax error

Reasoning process:
1. The code uses nested loops to build the `discount` array. The outer loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`, representing the current word.
2. The next loop mistakenly has a condition `j >= n`, which will always be false. It should be `j <= n` to iterate over all other words.
3. This error causes the inner loop to never execute, resulting in an empty `discount` array.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String shortestSuperstring(String[] words) {
        int n = words.length;
        int[][] discount = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { // Fix: Change condition to 'j < n'
                for (int k = 0; k < words[i].length() && i != j; k++) { // build discount map from i->j and j->i
                    if (words[j].startsWith(words[i].substring(k))) {
                        discount[i][j] = words[i].length() - k;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```
