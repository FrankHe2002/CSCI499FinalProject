Bug Type: Logical error
 
Reasoning Process:
1. `countVowelPermutation` method initializes the dp array with dimensions `6 x (n + 1)`, where `6` represents the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'z'.
2. The base case is handled correctly when `n` is equal to `1`.
3. The code then calls the `helper` method with `n` and the vowel 'z'.
4. In the `helper` method, the base case is correctly handled when `n` is equal to `0`.
5. However, there is a logical error in the code when `vowel` is equal to 'z'.
   a. Currently, the code calculates `ans` by recursively calling the `helper` method for each vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and summing the results.
   b. The calculated value of `ans` is stored in the dp array using `dp[5][n]`.
   c. This logic is incorrect because `dp[5][n]` should store the result for the vowel 'z', not the sum of results for other vowels.
   d. Since there is no need to store results for 'z' separately, the `ans` calculation for 'z' can be removed, and the 'z' case can be handled in the subsequent else-if ladder.
6. The rest of the else-if ladder in the `helper` method handles the cases for 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' correctly and stores the results in the dp array.
7. The code correctly returns `dp[5][n]` in the `countVowelPermutation` method.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the calculation of `ans` in the 'z' case in the `helper` method.
2. Change the comment above the 'z' case to indicate that 'z' is skipped.
3. Adjust the code so that 'z' is handled in the appropriate else-if ladder.
4. No other changes are necessary.
