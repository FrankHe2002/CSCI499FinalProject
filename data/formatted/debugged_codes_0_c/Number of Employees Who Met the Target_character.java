The bug in the provided code is a syntax error in the for loop. The closing curly brace `}` of the for loop is missing, which leads to a compilation error.

To fix the bug, we need to add the missing closing curly brace `}` after the count++ statement.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(int[] hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i : hours) {
            if (i >= target) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
