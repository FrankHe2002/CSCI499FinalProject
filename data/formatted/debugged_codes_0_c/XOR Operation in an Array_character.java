The bug in the given Java code is a syntax error in the first for loop. The loop declaration is missing the opening parenthesis. To fix this, we need to add the opening parenthesis before the "int" keyword. Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int xorOperation(int n, int start) {
        int nums[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = start + 2 * i;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = nums[i - 1] ^ nums[i];
        return nums[n - 1];
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the missing opening parenthesis in the first for loop declaration has been added before the "int" keyword. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
