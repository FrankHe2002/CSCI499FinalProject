Bug type: Array Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a queue to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the nearest exit in a maze.
2. The code iterates through the queue and checks the neighboring cells in the maze.
3. If a neighboring cell is valid (within the maze boundaries and not visited before), it is added to the queue for further exploration.
4. The code checks if the current cell is a boundary cell, which means it has reached an exit.
5. If a boundary cell is found, the code returns the number of steps taken.
6. If no boundary cell is found, the code continues the BFS until all possible cells are explored, and then returns -1.

Bug:
In the line `if (visited[-1][y] || maze[x][y] == '+') continue;`, the code attempts to access the `visited` array using the index `-1`. This causes an Array Index Out of Bounds Exception.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we can change the condition from `if (visited[-1][y] || maze[x][y] == '+') continue;` to `if (x == -1 || visited[x][y] || maze[x][y] == '+') continue;`. This change ensures that the code correctly checks if the current cell is visited or if it contains a '+'. Also, we need to update the 'continue' statement to skip the iteration.

Here is the updated code:

```java
// Runtime: 8 ms (Top 87.01%) | Memory: 43.7 MB (Top 91.43%)
class Solution {
    public int nearestExit(char[][] maze, int[] entrance) {
        int rows = maze.length, cols = maze[0].length, queueSize;
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];
        int[] curr;
        int[][] dirs = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {- 1, 0}};
        int x, y, steps = 0;

        queue.offer(entrance);
        visited[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = true;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            queueSize = queue.size();
            steps++;

            for (int i = 0; i < queueSize; i++) {
                curr = queue.poll();

                for (int[] dir :
