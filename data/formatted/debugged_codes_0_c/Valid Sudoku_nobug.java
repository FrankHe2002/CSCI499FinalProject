There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is related to the use of the `HashSet` object `seen`. 

The code is trying to check for duplicate values in each row, column, and sub-box in a Sudoku board represented by the `board` array.

The bug is in the following statement:

```java
if (!(seen.add(currentVal + "found in row " + i)) ||
       !(seen.add(currentVal + "found in column " + j)) ||
       !(seen.add(currentVal + "found in sub box " + i/3 + "-" + j/3)))
    return false;
```

The issue is that the condition `seen.add(...)` is negated using `!`, which means that the code will only return `false` if all the values are successfully added to the `seen` set. This is not desirable because we want to check if any duplicate values are found, not all.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `!` operator from each condition. So the corrected code is:

```java
if (seen.add(currentVal + "found in row " + i) ||
        seen.add(currentVal + "found in column " + j) ||
        seen.add(currentVal + "found in sub box " + i/3 + "-" + j/3))
    return false;
```

Additionally, I noticed that the code declares and initializes the `seen` set but doesn't define its type. To ensure type safety, we can explicitly define the `seen` set as `HashSet<String>`. So the updated code with the bug fix and type declaration is:

```java
HashSet<String> seen = new HashSet<>();

for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
        if (board[i][j] != '.') {
            char currentVal = board[i][j];
            if (seen.add(currentVal + "found in row " + i) ||
                    seen.add(currentVal + "found in column " + j) ||
                    seen.add(currentVal + "found in sub box " + i/3 + "-" + j/3))
                return false;
        }
    }
}

return true;
```
