The Java code appears to be functioning correctly. It initializes a HashSet called "set" and populates it with the sum of each number and its reverse, ranging from 0 to 100,000. The "sumOfNumberAndReverse" method simply checks if the given number is present in the set and returns a boolean value accordingly.

There doesn't seem to be any obvious bugs in the code as it is working as expected.

No changes are required in this case.
