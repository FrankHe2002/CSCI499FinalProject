Bug type: Logic error

Explanations:
1. The `maxValue` method uses binary search to find the maximum possible value to be placed at the given index position. It uses the `calcAns` method to calculate the sum of the array when the maximum value is set to `max`.
2. The `calcAns` method calculates the sum of the array by dividing it into two parts: the left part and the right part.
3. The `calcPart` method calculates the sum of the arithmetic progression (AP) of the array.

Bug:
In the `calcPart` method, when the total number of elements is less than `a`, the calculation of `an` is incorrect. It should be `an = a - num`, instead of `an = a - num + 1`.

Fix:
Change `an = a - num + 1;` to `an = a - num;` in the `calcPart` method.

Revised code:

```java
/* Intuition:
As the number of elements is 10^9 so we can't actually create the array
And by seeing the limit we can judge that the complexity should be O(logn)
So it will become obvious that binary search can only help to solve this prob

We have to put the maximum possible value in the index position and then all 
the values to its right and left should decrease by 1 until the value reaches 1
for Ex in n = 6, index = 1,  maxSum = 10

our index at 1 should be 3 and the array will look like
2  3  2 1 1
+ max - - same

means you have to make an array which is strictly increasing and it attains its max (which is answer)
then strictly decreasing till value becomes 1 and then continues it as 1. Like
1 ... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6(if answer is 6), 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, .... 1

Why this solution?
Because our objective is to maximize our index position value i.e. ans. So to maximize it
we all the other elements other than index position should be as low as possible (so that sum of our array
is less than maxSum), which will lead to this solution of "Get the max element on index given and decrease strictly
on both sides of the array till our
