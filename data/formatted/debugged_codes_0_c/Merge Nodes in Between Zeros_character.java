The bug in the code lies in the condition `head == null && head.next == null`. This condition is incorrect because it checks if both `head` and `head.next` are null, which will throw a `NullPointerException` if `head` is null. Additionally, the logic of the while loop is incorrect, as it should iterate over each node starting from `head`, rather than `head.next`.

To fix the bug, we should change the condition to `head == null || head.next == null`, which checks if either `head` or `head.next` is null. As for the while loop, we should change the initialization of `temp` from `head.next` to `head`, since we want to iterate from the given `head` node itself.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeNodes(ListNode head) {
        ListNode newList = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode newHead = newList;
        ListNode newtemp = newList;
        
        ListNode temp = head;
        int sum = 0;
        
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        
        while (temp != null) {
            sum += temp.val;
            if (temp.val == 0) {
                ListNode node = new ListNode(sum);
                newtemp.next = node;
                newtemp = newtemp.next;
                sum = 0;
            }
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        
        return newHead.next;
    }
}
```
