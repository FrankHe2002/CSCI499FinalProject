The bug in the provided Java code is a syntax error in the if statement: 

```java
if (w.length() > s.length() return 0;
```

To fix this, we need to add a closing parenthesis ")" after "s.length()" and add a closing curly brace "}" after the return statement. 

```java
if (w.length() > s.length()) {
    return 0;
}
```

Additionally, there is a logical error in the while loop condition: 

```java
while (sb.length() <= s.length())
```

Since 's' is the input string, and 'sb' is a StringBuilder object that appends 'w' repeatedly, the condition to check the length of 'sb' should be strictly less than 's.length()'. Otherwise, the loop will continue even after 'sb' becomes longer than 's', resulting in an incorrect answer. 

To fix this, we need to change the condition from "<=" to "<":

```java
while (sb.length() < s.length())
```

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxRepeating(String s, String w) {
        if (w.length() > s.length()) {
            return 0;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("");
        while (sb.length() < s.length()) {
            sb.append(w);
            if (s.contains(sb)) {
                ans++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
