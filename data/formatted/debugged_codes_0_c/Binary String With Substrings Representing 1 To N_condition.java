The bug in the code lies in the for loop condition in the 'queryString' method. The condition should be 'i <= n' instead of 'i >= n'. 

The reasoning process involves analyzing the loop condition and understanding its intention. In this case, the loop is meant to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive). However, the current condition 'i >= n' will cause the loop to immediately terminate if n is greater than or equal to 1, resulting in returning false.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to 'i <= n', which will ensure that the loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive). 

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean queryString(String s, int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (!s.contains(toBinary(i)))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public String toBinary(int n) {
        String binary = "";
        while (n > 0) {
            int r = n % 2; //to find remainder
            binary = Integer.toString(r) + binary; //Last found remainder is MSB of Binary represantation. Hence, it is added first.
            n = n / 2; //make the number ready for next iteration
        }
        return binary;
    }
}
```
