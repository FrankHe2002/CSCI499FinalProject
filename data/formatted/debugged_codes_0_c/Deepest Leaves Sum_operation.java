Bug Type: Logic Error

Explanation: The algorithm calculates the height of the tree using the `height()` method. However, in the `deepestLeavesSum()` method, the variable `hght` is not used correctly to determine the deepest level of the tree. The condition `hght == 1` is used to check if the current level is the deepest level, but it should be `hght == 0` because `hght` should be reduced by 1 after processing the null node at each level.

Additionally, the `height(root) * 1` is not necessary and can be removed.

To fix the bug, I will modify the `deepestLeavesSum()` method as follows:

```java
public int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return 0;

    Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
    q.add(root);
    q.add(null);
    int hght = height(root) - 1; // Subtract 1 to correctly check the deepest level
    int sum = 0;
    while (q.size() > 0 && q.peek() != null) {
        TreeNode temp = q.remove();
        if (temp.left != null) q.add(temp.left);
        if (temp.right != null) q.add(temp.right);
        if (q.peek() == null) {
            q.remove();
            q.add(null);
            hght--;
        }
        if (hght == 0) { // Check if it's the deepest level
            while (q.size() > 0 && q.peek() != null) {
                sum += q.remove().val;
            }
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```
