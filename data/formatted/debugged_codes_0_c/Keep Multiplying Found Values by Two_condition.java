The Java code provided has a logical bug. 

The initial part of the code defines a HashSet called "set" and iterates through the elements of the "nums" array. If an element is less than the original value, it is added to the set. This part of the code seems correct.

However, there is a bug in the while loop. The loop checks if the set contains the original value, and if so, it multiplies the original value by 2. Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.

The bug is that the while loop is an infinite loop. The loop continues indefinitely even if the original value does not exist in the set because the variable "original" is not updated within the loop.

To fix this bug, the variable "original" needs to be updated within the loop so that the loop can eventually exit. The fix requires changing the "if" statement within the loop to an "else if" statement.

Here is the revised code with the bug fix:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public int findFinalValue(int[] nums, int original) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i < original) {
                set.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        while (true) {
            if (set.contains(original)) {
                original *= 2;
            } else if (!set.contains(original)) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return original;
    }
}
```
