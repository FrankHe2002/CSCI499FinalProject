Bug type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to access elements in 5D array `dp` using indexes `row + 2`, `in_count`, `ex_count`, `prev_in_pos`, and `prev_ex_pos`.
2. However, the size of the array `dp` is declared as `new Integer[m + 1][introvertsCount + 1][extrovertsCount + 1][(1 << (n + 1))][(1 << (n + 1))]`.
3. The first dimension of the array is indexed using the variable `row + 2`, which causes an out of bounds exception when `row` is `m - 2` or greater.

Fix:
Change the indexing from `row + 2` to `row` in the following line:
```java
if (dp[row + 2][in_count][ex_count][prev_in_pos][prev_ex_pos] != null)
```
to:
```java
if (dp[row][in_count][ex_count][prev_in_pos][prev_ex_pos] != null)
```
