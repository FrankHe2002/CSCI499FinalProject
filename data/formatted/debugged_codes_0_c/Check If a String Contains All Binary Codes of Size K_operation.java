The bug in the code is in the line `hs.add(s.substring(i, i - k));`. 

The reasoning process for identifying the bug is as follows:
1. The loop iterates from 0 to s.length() - k, so the substring should be taken from index i to i + k.
2. However, the code is taking the substring from index i to i - k, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to change `s.substring(i, i - k)` to `s.substring(i, i + k)`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasAllCodes(String s, int k) {
        HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet();
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - k; i++) {
            hs.add(s.substring(i, i + k));
        }
        if (hs.size() == Math.pow(2, k)) return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```
