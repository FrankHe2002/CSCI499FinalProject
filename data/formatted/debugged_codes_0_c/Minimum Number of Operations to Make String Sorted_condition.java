Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning: 

1. The code calculates the number of sorted strings that can be obtained by performing one swap operation on the input string.
2. It uses an array `count` to keep track of the count of each character in the string.
3. It calculates the count inverse for each character using the `countInverse` method, which counts the number of smaller characters appearing before the current character.
4. It multiplies the count inverse by the factorial of the number of remaining characters (i.e., `fact[n - i - 1]`), where `n` is the length of the string and `i` is the current index.
5. It then multiplies the result by a factor `div` which is the product of the count of the current character and `div` itself.
6. It uses modular exponentiation to calculate `div.modPow(mod.subtract(new BigInteger(String.valueOf(2))), mod)`.
7. It adds the result to `res` and takes the modulo `mod`, and repeats the above steps for each character in the string.
8. Finally, it returns the integer value of `res`.

However, there are two bugs in the code:

1. `factory` method: In the `factory` method, the loop condition `i > n` should be `i <= n` to correctly populate the `fact` array with factorials. Currently, the `fact` array is not populated with the factorial values, which will lead to incorrect calculations when multiplying with `fact[n - i - 1]`.

2. `countInverse` method: In the `countInverse` method, the variable `cnt` should be declared as a `BigInteger`, not a `long`, because it can have large values beyond the range of `long`. This will ensure accurate counting of the smaller characters.

To fix the bugs:

1. In the `factory` method, change the loop condition from `i > n` to `i <= n`:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++ i) {
    fact[i] = fact[i - 1].multiply(new BigInteger(String.valueOf(i))).mod(mod);
}
```

2. In the `countInverse` method, change the type of `cnt` from `long` to `BigInteger`:

```java
BigInteger cnt = BigInteger.ZERO;
```

Corrected code:

```java
import java.math.*;

class Solution {
    public int makeStringSorted(String s)
