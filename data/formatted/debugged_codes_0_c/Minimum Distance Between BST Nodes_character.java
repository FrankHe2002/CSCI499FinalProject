The bug in the provided code is related to the initialization of the `mini` variable. 

Currently, the `mini` variable is initialized with the value `Integer.MAX_VALUE` outside of any method. Since the provided code is designed to find the minimum difference between nodes in a binary search tree (BST), it is assumed that there will be at least two nodes in the tree. However, if the BST contains only one node, the `mini` variable will not be properly updated because the `for` loop that calculates the minimum difference relies on the size of the `arr` list to be greater than or equal to 2.

To fix this bug, the `mini` variable should be initialized to a value that represents "undefined" or "infinity" before the `for` loop calculation. An appropriate value for this purpose is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.0%) | Memory: 40.00 MB (Top 72.0%)

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 * int val;
 * TreeNode left;
 * TreeNode right;
 * TreeNode() {
 * TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 * TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 * this.val = val;
 * this.left = left;
 * this.right = right;
 * }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    int mini;

    public void find(TreeNode root, ArrayList<Integer> arr) {

        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }


        arr.add(root.val);

        find(root.left, arr);

        for (int i = arr.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {

            mini = Math.min(mini, Math.abs(root.val - arr.get(i)));
        }

        find(root.right, arr);

        arr.remove(arr.size() - 1);
    }

    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        mini = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
        find(root, arr);
        return mini;
    }
}
```

By initializing the `mini` variable inside the `minDiffInBST` method instead of at the class level, we ensure that it starts with a valid initial value before any calculation is performed.
