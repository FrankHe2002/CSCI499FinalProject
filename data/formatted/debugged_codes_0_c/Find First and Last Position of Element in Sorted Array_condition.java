The bug in the provided Java code is in the `search` method. The `start` and `end` indices are not updated correctly when searching for the start or end index of the target value.

To identify the bug, we need to understand the purpose of the `search` method. It is a binary search algorithm that finds the target value in the `nums` array. If `findStart` is true, it finds the index of the first occurrence of the target value. If `findStart` is false, it finds the index of the last occurrence of the target value.

Here is the correct implementation of the `search` method:

```java
int search(int[] nums, int target, boolean findStart) {
    int ans = -1;
    int start = 0;
    int end = nums.length - 1;
    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (target > nums[mid]) {
            start = mid + 1;
        } else if (target < nums[mid]) {
            end = mid - 1;
        } else {
            ans = mid;
            if (findStart) {
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

The bug in the original code is in the `if (target >= nums[mid])` condition. If the target is greater or equal to `nums[mid]`, it should update `start` to `mid + 1` instead of `start = mid + 1`. Similarly, in the `else if (target < nums[mid])` condition, it should update `end` to `mid - 1` instead of `end = mid - 1`.

The bug is fixed by modifying the `search` method as shown above. The fix is done by changing the incorrect assignment statements to the correct ones.
