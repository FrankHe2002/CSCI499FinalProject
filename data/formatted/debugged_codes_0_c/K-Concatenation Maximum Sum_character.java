Bug: Missing semicolon in line 21 of the code.

To identify the bug, we need to carefully review the code and identify any syntax errors that may exist.
Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The code defines a class named "Solution" with two methods: "kadane" and "kConcatenationMaxSum".
2. The "kadane" method takes an array of integers as input and finds the maximum sum of any subarray using the Kadane's algorithm.
3. The "kConcatenationMaxSum" method takes an array of integers and an integer "k" as input. It concatenates the array with itself "k" times and then calculates the maximum sum using the "kadane" method.
4. The code initializes a variable "mod" with the value 1000000007.
5. The "kadane" method initializes two variables "curr" and "max" with 0 and the minimum integer value respectively.
6. The code iterates over each element "i" in the input array "a" and updates "curr" and "max" accordingly.
7. The "kadane" method returns the maximum sum modulo "mod".
8. The "kConcatenationMaxSum" method checks if "k" is equal to 1, and if so, it directly returns the maximum sum of the input array using the "kadane" method.
9. The code initializes an array "temp" with twice the length of the input array "arr".
10. The next for loop in line 19 initializes the "temp" array by copying the elements from "arr" and repeating them twice.
11. The code then checks if "k" is equal to 2, and if so, it returns the maximum sum of the "temp" array using the "kadane" method.
12. The code then calculates the sum of all elements in the input array "arr" and stores it in the variable "sum".
13. If the sum is greater than or equal to zero, the code returns the maximum sum of the "temp" array plus the modulo of the sum multiplied by "k-2" modulo "mod".
14. If the sum is less than zero, the code returns the maximum sum of the "temp" array modulo "mod".

Now, let's apply the fix by adding the missing semicolon in line 21:
```java
class Solution {
    int mod = 1000000007;

    public int kadane(int[]
