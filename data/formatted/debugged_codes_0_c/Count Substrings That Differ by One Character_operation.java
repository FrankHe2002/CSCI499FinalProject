The bug in the provided Java code is an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in the line `dp[i][j][1] = (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) ? dp[i - 1][j + 1][1] : dp[i - 1][j - 1][0] + 1;` inside the nested for loop.

To identify this bug, we can analyze the logic of the code step-by-step:

1. The code initializes a 3D array "dp" with dimensions [m][n][2], where m and n are the lengths of strings s and t respectively.
2. The code iterates over the first column (s[0:i] and t[0:0]), setting values in the dp array based on whether the characters at corresponding indices are the same or not. It also adds dp[i][0][1] to the result for each iteration.
3. The code then iterates over the first row (s[0:0] and t[0:j]), doing the same as in step 2.
4. Finally, the code iterates over the remaining cells of the dp array and updates the values based on whether the characters at corresponding indices are the same or not. It also adds dp[i][j][1] to the result for each iteration.

The bug occurs in the line `dp[i][j][1] = (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) ? dp[i - 1][j + 1][1] : dp[i - 1][j - 1][0] + 1;` inside the last nested for loop. The issue is with the index `j + 1` in the first condition of the ternary operator. Since `j` is the loop variable, when j reaches the last column, `j + 1` becomes out of bounds for the dp array.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `j + 1` does not exceed the upper bound of the dp array. We can do this by adding a condition to check if `j + 1` is less than `n` before accessing that element of the dp array.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// version 1 : O(mn) space
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s, String t) {
        int m = s.length(), n = t.length();

        int[][][] dp = new int[m][n][2];
