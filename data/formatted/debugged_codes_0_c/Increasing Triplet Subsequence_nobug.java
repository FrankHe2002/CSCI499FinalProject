Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
- The code checks if there exists a sequence of three increasing numbers in the given array.
- The code initializes two variables `x` and `y` with the maximum integer value.
- It then iterates through the array and updates the values of `x` and `y` if a smaller value is encountered.
- If a number greater than both `x` and `y` is encountered, it means that there exists a triplet and the code returns true.
- If the loop completes without finding a triplet, the code returns false.

The bug in the code is that it incorrectly returns true as soon as it encounters a number greater than `y`, without ensuring that it is also greater than `x`. This means that it may incorrectly identify a triplet even if the numbers are not actually in increasing order.

Example:
For the input [1, 2, 1, 3], the current code will incorrectly return true, indicating the presence of a triplet (1, 2, 3). However, the numbers are not in increasing order, hence this is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditions for updating `x`, `y`, and returning true as follows:

```java
if (i <= x) {
    x = i;
} else if (i <= y) {
    y = i;
} else {
    return false; // updated from "true" to "false"
}
```
By returning false when a number greater than `y` is encountered, we ensure that the numbers are in increasing order before returning true. If the loop completes without finding a valid triplet, the code will return false.

Here is the updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean increasingTriplet(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 3)
            return false;

        int x = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int y = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i <= x) {
                x = i;
            } else if (i <= y) {
                y = i;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
