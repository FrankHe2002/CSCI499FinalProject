There doesn't seem to be any syntax errors or obvious logical errors in the given Java code. However, the bug type in this code is that it doesn't correctly determine the minimum digit in the given string `n`. 

To identify and fix the bug, we can analyze the code step-by-step:

1. The variable `res` is initialized to 0, which will eventually store the minimum digit.
2. The `for` loop iterates through each character in the string `n`.
3. Inside the loop, the line `res = Math.max(res, n.charAt(i) - '0');` compares the current digit with `res` and stores the larger of the two in `res`. This is incorrect as it actually determines the maximum digit, not the minimum.

To fix the bug and correctly determine the minimum digit, we need to change the line `res = Math.max(res, n.charAt(i) - '0');` to `res = Math.min(res, n.charAt(i) - '0');`, which will compare and store the smaller digit in `res`.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPartitions(String n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n.length(); i++) {
            res = Math.min(res, n.charAt(i) - '0');
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

By changing `Math.max` to `Math.min`, the code will now correctly determine the minimum digit in the string `n`.
