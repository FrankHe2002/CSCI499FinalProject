The bug in the provided code is in the nested for loop conditions. 

Currently, the conditions for the nested for loop are `j < points[i].length - 1`, which means the loop will iterate until `j` is less than `points[i].length - 1`. However, `points[i].length` is the length of the inner array at index `i`, which is always 2 in this case. So the loop will only iterate once, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition of the inner loop to `j < points[i + 1].length - 1`. This will ensure that the loop iterates until `j` is less than the length of the next inner array.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 57.50*) | Memory: 43.4 MB (Top 57.64%)
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(int[][] points) {
        int max = 0, x, y;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < points[i + 1].length - 1; j++) {
                x = Math.abs(points[i][j] - points[i + 1][j]);
                y = Math.abs(points[i][j + 1] - points[i + 1][j + 1]);
                max += Math.max(x, y);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
