The bug in the provided Java code is the incorrect implementation of the `inBounds` method. Currently, the method checks if the indices `i` and `j` are less than the grid dimensions `n` and `m` respectively, but it does not check if they are greater than or equal to 0.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `inBounds` method to include the boundary condition as follows:

```java
public boolean inBounds(int i, int j, int n, int m) {
    return (0 <= i && i < n && 0 <= j && j < m);
}
```

This modification ensures that the indices `i` and `j` are within the valid range of the grid dimensions.

By making this minimal change, we can fix the bug in the code.
