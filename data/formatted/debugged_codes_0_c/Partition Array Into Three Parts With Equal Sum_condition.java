The bug in the provided Java code is in the return statement. The condition `count > 3` should be `count >= 3`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canThreePartsEqualSum(int[] arr) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int no : arr) {
            sum += no;
        }
        if (sum % 3 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        sum = sum / 3;
        int tempSum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            tempSum += arr[i];
            if (tempSum == sum) {
                count++;
                tempSum = 0;
            }
        }

        return count >= 3;
    }
}
```

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows:

1. The code checks if the sum of all elements in the array `arr` can be divided into three equal parts.
2. It calculates the sum of all elements in `arr` using a loop.
3. If the sum is not divisible by 3, it returns `false`.
4. Otherwise, it sets the target sum to `sum / 3`.
5. It initializes a temporary sum variable and a count variable to keep track of the number of times the target sum is reached.
6. It loops through `arr` and adds each element to the temporary sum.
7. If the temporary sum equals the target sum, it increments the count and resets the temporary sum to 0.
8. After the loop, it checks if the count is greater than 3. If it is, it returns `true`.
9. The bug in the code is in the return statement. The condition `count > 3` should be `count >= 3` because we want to check if the count is greater than or equal to 3.
