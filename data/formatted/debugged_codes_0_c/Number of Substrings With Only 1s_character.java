Bug Type:

The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning Process:

By observing the code, we can see that the programmer intended to count the number of subarrays in the string "s" consisting of only the character '1'. The code uses a variable "count" to keep track of the number of consecutive '1' characters encountered. It also uses a variable "result" to keep track of the total number of subarrays.

However, there is a logical error in the code. The placement of the curly braces is incorrect, causing the "result += count" statement to execute for every character in the string, regardless of whether it is '1' or not. This results in an incorrect count of subarrays.

Proposed Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the placement of the curly braces so that the "result += count" statement is only executed when a '1' character is encountered.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSub(String s) {
        char[] ch = s.toCharArray();
        long count = 0;
        long result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ch.length; i++) {
            if (ch[i] == '1') {
                count++;
                result += count;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return (int) (result % 1000000007);
    }
}
```

Note: The fix was made by adding a pair of curly braces around the statements that should be executed when the condition "ch[i] == '1'" is true.
