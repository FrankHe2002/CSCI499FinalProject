The bug in the provided code lies in the calculation of `maxTriangular` variable. 

To identify the bug, we need to understand the purpose of the code and analyze each step carefully. 

1. The code is trying to calculate the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of consecutive positive integers. 
2. It starts by calculating the maximum triangular number (the sum of 1, 2, 3, ..., k) that is less than or equal to `n`. It does this by solving the quadratic equation `k(k+1)/2 <= n`.
3. Then, it iterates from 2 to `maxTriangular` and checks if `n - triangular` is divisible by `m`. If it is, it means that `n` can be expressed as the sum of `m` consecutive positive integers, so it increments the `ways` variable. 
4. Finally, it returns the `ways` variable, which represents the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of consecutive positive integers.

Now, let's analyze the bug:

The calculation of `maxTriangular` is flawed. It uses the formula `(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8n)) / 2`, where `n` is cast to `double` to avoid integer overflow. While the intention is to calculate the maximum triangular number, the formula doesn't give the correct result.

To fix the bug, we can use an alternative approach to calculate `maxTriangular`. Instead of the square root formula, we can start with `maxTriangular` set to 1 and iterate while `triangular` is less than or equal to `n`. This way, `maxTriangular` will be the correct value.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) {
        int maxTriangular = 1;
        int triangular = 1;
        while (triangular <= n) {
            maxTriangular++;
            triangular += maxTriangular;
        }
        
        int ways = 1;
        triangular = 1;
        for (int m = 2; m <= maxTriangular; ++m) {
            triangular += m;
            final int difference = n - triangular;
            if ((difference % m) == 0) {
                ways++;
            }
        }
        return ways;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by correctly calculating `maxTriangular`.
