Based on the given code, one potential bug is in the `hasEdge` method. The method is used to check whether an edge exists between two given nodes (`u` and `v`). 

The bug is that the condition `(edge[0] == u && edge[1] == v) || (edge[0] == v && edge[1] == u)` only checks for an exact match between `u` and `v` in both orders, i.e., `(u,v)` and `(v,u)`. It doesn't account for the case where there might be another node `w` connecting `u` and `v`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `hasEdge` method to consider all possible combinations of the edges. We can use a loop to iterate through each edge and check if any of the endpoints match `u` and `v`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
private boolean hasEdge(int[][] edges, int u, int v) {
    for (int[] edge : edges) {
        if ((edge[0] == u && edge[1] == v) || (edge[0] == v && edge[1] == u)) {
            return true;
        }
        if ((edge[0] == u && edge[1] != v && edge[1] != u) || (edge[0] != u && edge[0] != v && edge[1] == v)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

In the modified code, we added an additional condition to check for any other node `w` that connects `u` and `v`. This way, we cover all possible combinations of edges and correctly determine if there is an edge between `u` and `v`.
