Bug Type: Infinite Loop

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a while loop with the condition "while (true)", indicating that the loop is meant to run indefinitely until the "break" statement is executed.
2. Inside the loop, there is an "if" condition that checks if "num % (n - 1) == 1". If true, the loop is meant to break and the method should return the value of "ans".
3. The else block inside the loop is executed when the condition in step 2 is false. It increments the value of "ans" and updates the value of "num" using the formula "(num * 2) % (n - 1)".
4. By observing the logic, it can be deduced that the loop should eventually break and return a value for "ans".
5. However, there is a possibility of an infinite loop if the condition "num % (n - 1) == 1" is never satisfied. This can occur if "n" is not a prime number or if the initial value of "num" is always a multiple of "(n - 1)".
6. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition in the "if" statement to ensure a terminating condition for the loop.

Solution:
Modify the "if" condition in the while loop to check if "num" is equal to 1 rather than checking if it is congruent to 1 modulo "(n - 1)".

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int reinitializePermutation(int n) {
        int ans = 1;
        int num = 2;
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        while (true) {
            if (num == 1) break;  // Modified condition
            else {
                ans++;
                num = (num * 2) % (n - 1);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
