Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code aims to find the maximum product of the lengths of two words from a given array of words, such that the two words do not share any common letters.
2. The code first creates an array `masks` of size `n`, where `n` is the length of the input array `words`.
3. Each index `i` of `masks` stores a bitmask representing the presence or absence of letters in the word at index `i` of `words`.
4. The code initializes a variable `largest` to 0, which will be used to store the maximum product of word lengths.
5. The code then iterates over each pair of words `i` and `j` in `words`, and checks if the bitwise AND of their respective masks (i.e., `masks[i] & masks[j]`) equals 0.
    - This condition ensures that words `i` and `j` do not share any common letters, as the bitwise AND operation will only be 0 if no common letters are present.
    - If the condition is true, the code updates `largest` with the maximum product of word lengths.
6. Finally, the code returns `largest`.

Bug Explanation:
The provided code has a logical error in the nested loop for checking the pairwise common letters between words. The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n - 1`, and the inner loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j < n`. This loop condition skips the last word in the array, preventing it from being compared with any other words.

Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the loop condition of the outer loop to `i < n`. This ensures that the last word is also included in the pairwise comparison with other words. The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 14 ms (Top 91.40%) | Memory: 44.6 MB (Top 93.55*)
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(String[] words) {
        int n = words.length;
        int[] masks = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            for (char c : words[i].toCharArray())
                masks[i] |= (1 << (c - 'a'));

        int largest = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i
