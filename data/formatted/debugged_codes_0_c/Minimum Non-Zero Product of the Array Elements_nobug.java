The code calculates the minimum non-zero product of an array with 2^p elements. The bug in the code lies in the calculation of the variable `sum`.

To identify the bug, let's break down the code and analyze each step:

1. The code starts by declaring a variable `mod` and initializing it to 1_000_000_007.
2. The code defines a method `minNonZeroProduct` which takes an integer `p` as a parameter and returns an integer.
3. The code checks if `p` is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1. Otherwise, it continues to the next step.
4. The code calculates the maximum value of the array `mx` as Math.pow(2, p) - 1.
5. The code calculates the value of `sm` as `mx` - 1.
6. The code calculates the value of `n` as `sm / 2`.
7. The code calls the recursive method `rec` with parameters `sm` and `n` and assigns the result to `sum`.
8. The code returns the product of `sum`, `mx`, and `mod` modulo `mod`.

The bug in the code is in step 7. The recursive method `rec` calculates the `newVal` as `(val % mod) * (val % mod) % mod`, which is incorrect. It should be calculated as `(val * val) % mod` to ensure the multiplication is done before taking the modulo.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `long newVal = ((val % mod) * (val % mod)) % mod;` to `long newVal = (val * val) % mod;`. This will correctly calculate the new value.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int mod = 1_000_000_007;

    public int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {
        if (p == 1) return 1;

        long mx = (long) (Math.pow(2, p)) - 1;
        long sm = mx - 1;
        long n = sm / 2;
        long sum = rec(sm, n);

        return (int) (sum * (mx % mod) % mod);
    }

    public long rec(long val, long n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return (
