The provided code calculates the projection area of a 3D grid. The algorithm appears to be correct, but there is a bug in the way the area is calculated in the second loop.

The bug in the code is that the check for non-zero elements in the second loop is missing. This means that the total area will include the number of non-zero elements in each column, rather than just counting them once.

To fix the bug, we need to add the condition to check if the element is non-zero before incrementing the total area. We can simply add an if statement inside the second loop to check if the current element is non-zero.

Here is the fixed code with the minimal change highlighted:

```java
class Solution {
    public int projectionArea(int[][] grid) {
        int totalArea = 0;

        for (int[] row : grid) {
            int max = row[0];
            for (int c : row) {
                if (max < c) {
                    max = c;
                }
                if (c != 0) {
                    totalArea += 1;
                }
            }
            totalArea += max;
        }

        for (int c = 0; c < grid[0].length; c++) {
            int max = grid[0][c];
            for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
                if (max < grid[row][c]) {
                    max = grid[row][c];
                }
                if (grid[row][c] != 0) {  // Added condition to check for non-zero element
                    totalArea += 1;
                }
            }
            totalArea += max;
        }
        return totalArea;
    }
}
```

By adding the condition `if (grid[row][c] != 0)`, we ensure that only non-zero elements are counted in the total area.
