There is a bug in the provided Java code. In the nested for loop for updating the dp array, the condition for the inner loop is incorrect. 

Current loop condition:
```java
for (int j = 1; j >= m; j++) {
```

The condition should be:
```java
for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
```

Reasoning process:
- The outer loop is iterating from 1 to n (inclusive), which corresponds to the indices of word1.
- The inner loop should iterate from 1 to m (inclusive), which corresponds to the indices of word2.
- However, the condition `j >= m` in the inner loop is incorrect because it won't allow the loop to run when `m > 1`.
- Changing the condition to `j <= m` will ensure that the loop runs for all valid indices of word2.

Fix:
```java
for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
```

Fixed Java code:
```java
// Runtime: 20 ms (Top 23.73%) | Memory: 46.5 MB (Top 77.36%)
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int n = word1.length();
        int m = word2.length();

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[0][i] = 0;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        int common = dp[n][m];
        return (n + m) - (2 * common);

    }
}
