There are multiple bugs in the provided Java code.

1. The first bug is in the `count` method where `a[Runtime]` is being assigned a value. It seems like `Runtime` is a typo and should be replaced with `i`. This bug is a compilation error.

2. The second bug is in the `count` method where the termination condition of the loop is incorrect. Instead of `i <= n`, it should be `i < n` because the loop should iterate up to `n - 1`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `n`, the condition `i == n + 1` in the following `if` statement will never be true, causing an infinite recursion. This bug is a logical error.

To fix these bugs, the following changes can be made:

```java
class Solution {

    public void count(int n, int[] a, int k) {
        int i;
        for (i = k; i < k * 2 && i < n; i++) // fix termination condition
            a[i] = a[i - k] + 1; // fix array index
        if (i == n + 1)
            return;
        count(n, a, k * 2);
    }

    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int a[] = new int[n + 1];
        a[0] = 0;
        count(n, a, 1);
        return a;
    }
}
```

The changes made in the code are as follows:
- In the `count` method, the termination condition of the loop was changed to `i < n`.
- In the `count` method, the array index was corrected to `a[i]`.
Note that no changes were made to the overall structure or logic of the code.
