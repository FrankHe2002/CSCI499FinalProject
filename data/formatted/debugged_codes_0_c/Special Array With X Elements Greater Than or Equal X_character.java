The code has a missing closing bracket in the line `res += counts[i;`. This results in a compilation error.

To fix the bug, we need to add the closing bracket `]` at the end of the line mentioned above.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 88.84%) | Memory: 42.3 MB (Top 22.19%)
class Solution {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        int x = nums.length;
        int[] counts = new int[x + 1];

        for (int elem : nums)
            if (elem >= x)
                counts[x]++;
            else
                counts[elem]++;

        int res = 0;
        for (int i = counts.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            res += counts[i];
            if (res == i)
                return i;
        }

        return - 1;
    }
}
```

The bug fix is simply adding the closing bracket `]` after `counts[i`.
