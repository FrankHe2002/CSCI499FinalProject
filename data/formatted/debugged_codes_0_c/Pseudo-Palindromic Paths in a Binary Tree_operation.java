The bug in the provided code is that the return statement in the `helper` method is dividing the result of recursive calls to `helper` for the left and right subtrees. This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem and will lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to change the divide (`/`) operator to an addition (`+`) operator, as we want to add the number of pseudo-palindromic paths from the left and right subtrees.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int pseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode root) {
        return helper(root, 0);
    }

    public int helper(TreeNode node, int freq) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        freq = freq ^ (1 << node.val);
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return (freq & (freq - 1)) == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        return helper(node.left, freq) + helper(node.right, freq);
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, the bug is identified by carefully analyzing the purpose of the `helper` method and the logic of the problem. The fix is applied by replacing the divide (`/`) operator with the addition (`+`) operator.
