The provided Java code seems to have a syntax error where a closing parenthesis ")" is missing in the line:
```java
int rightMul = right.substring(j).equals"") ? 1 : Integer.parseInt(right.substring(j));
```
By examining the code and based on the error message, it appears that an additional closing parenthesis after `equals` is required.

The fix for this issue is to add the closing parenthesis ")" after `equals`:
```java
int rightMul = right.substring(j).equals("") ? 1 : Integer.parseInt(right.substring(j));
```

Please note that this fix is a minimal change that addresses the identified bug.
