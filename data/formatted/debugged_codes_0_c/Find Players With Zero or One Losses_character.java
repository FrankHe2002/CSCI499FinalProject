The bug in the given code is a syntax error in the line:

```java
int[] loss = new int100001];
```

The correct line should be:

```java
int[] loss = new int[100001];
```

To identify and fix the bug, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the bug by analyzing the code and understanding the intended functionality.
2. In this case, the bug is a syntax error caused by a missing opening square bracket in the declaration of the `loss` array.
3. To fix the bug, replace the line with the correct syntax `int[] loss = new int[100001];`.
4. The correct code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findWinners(int[][] matches) {
        int[] won = new int[100001];
        int[] loss = new int[100001];

        for (int[] match : matches) {
            won[match[0]]++;
            loss[match[1]]++;
        }

        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        List<Integer> wonAllMatches = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> lostOneMatch = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < won.length; i++) {
            if (won[i] > 0 && loss[i] == 0) {
                wonAllMatches.add(i);
            }

            if (loss[i] == 1) {
                lostOneMatch.add(i);
            }
        }

        ans.add(wonAllMatches);
        ans.add(lostOneMatch);

        return ans;
    }
}
```

The fix involved making minimal changes by adding the missing opening square bracket in the declaration of the `loss` array.
