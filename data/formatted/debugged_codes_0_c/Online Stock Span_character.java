Bug type: Compilation error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is incomplete and has a syntax error.
2. The error is on line 16, where the constructor of the `StockSpanner` class is defined.
3. The line is missing a semicolon at the end.
4. This causes a compilation error.

Fix:
Add a semicolon at the end of line 16.

```java
public StockSpanner() {
    stack = new Stack<>();
}
```

Updated code:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Pair {
    int stock;
    int span;

    public Pair(int stock, int span) {
        this.stock = stock;
        this.span = span;
    }

}

class StockSpanner {
    Stack<Pair> stack;

    public StockSpanner() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
    }

    public int next(int price) {
        int span = 1;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek().stock <= price) {
            Pair pStock = stack.pop();
            span += pStock.span;
        }
        stack.push(new Pair(price, span));
        return span;
    }
}

/**
 * Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * StockSpanner obj = new StockSpanner();
 * int param_1 = obj.next(price);
