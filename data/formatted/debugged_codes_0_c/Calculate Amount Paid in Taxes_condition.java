There are a few potential bugs in the given Java code.

1. The loop termination condition is incorrect. The code currently breaks out of the loop if `income` is still greater than 0 after subtracting `arr[0]`. However, it should break out of the loop if `income` is less than or equal to 0.

To fix this bug, we should change the condition `if (income > 0)` to `if (income <= 0)`.

2. The variable `arr` in the enhanced for loop is a reference to the original array `brackets`. Therefore, modifying `arr` will modify the original array as well.

To fix this bug, we can create a copy of each array in `brackets` using `Arrays.copyOf`.


Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public double calculateTax(int[][] brackets, int income) {
        double ans = 0;
        int pre = 0;
        for (int[] arr : brackets) {
            int[] copy = Arrays.copyOf(arr, arr.length);
            int val = copy[0];
            copy[0] -= pre;
            pre = val;
            ans += (double) (Math.min(income, copy[0]) * copy[1]) / 100;
            income -= copy[0];
            if (income <= 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

With these modifications, the code should now work correctly.
