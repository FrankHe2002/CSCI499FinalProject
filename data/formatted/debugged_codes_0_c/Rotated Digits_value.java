Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
- The code iterates from 1 to n (inclusive) and checks each number for rotation.
- It uses two Boolean variables `bool1` and `bool2` to keep track of whether the current number is valid and whether it contains any rotated digits respectively.
- In the while loop, each digit of the current number is checked.
  - If the digit is 3, 3, or 7, `bool1` is set to false, indicating that the number is not valid.
  - If the digit is 2, 5, 6, or 9, `bool2` is set to true, indicating that the number contains a rotated digit.
- At the end of the while loop, if `bool1` is true and `bool2` is true, the number is considered valid and `ans` is incremented.
- The final value of `ans` is returned as the result.

Potential bug:
- In the if statement that checks for rotated digits (m == 2 || m == 5 || m == 6 || m == 9), the digit 2 is repeated.
  - This is a logical error because it should be m == 2 || m == 5 || m == 6 || m == 9 instead of m == 3 || m == 5 || m == 6 || m == 9.
  - The repeated digit 3 would cause some numbers to be incorrectly considered as valid.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int rotatedDigits(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int k = i;
            boolean bool1 = true;
            boolean bool2 = false;
            while (k > 0) {
                int m = k % 10;
                if (m == 3 || m == 4 || m == 7) { // Fix: Change m == 3 to m == 4
                    bool1 = false;
                    break;
                } else if (m == 2 || m == 5 || m == 6 || m == 9) {
                    bool2 = true;
                }
                k /= 10;
            }
            if (bool1 && bool2) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
- The bug is fixed by changing the condition m == 3 to m
