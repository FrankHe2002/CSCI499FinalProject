The provided Java code looks for the maximum length between word1 and word2 using `Math.max(word1.length(), word2.length())`. Then, it iterates from 0 to lenmax-1 and appends characters from word1 and word2 to a StringBuilder object, alternating between the two strings.

The bug in the code lies in the second if statement inside the for loop. The condition `i >= word2.length()` is incorrect. It should be `i < word2.length()` to append characters from word2 when i is smaller than the length of word2.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition of the second if statement from `i >= word2.length()` to `i < word2.length()`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int lenmax = Math.max(word1.length(), word2.length());
        for (int i = 0; i <= lenmax - 1; i++) {
            if (i < word1.length()) sb.append(word1.charAt(i));
            if (i < word2.length()) sb.append(word2.charAt(i));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

Now the code should correctly merge the two input strings alternately.
