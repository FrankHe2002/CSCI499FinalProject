There is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the condition `if (nums.length != 1)`. This condition checks if the length of the `nums` array is not equal to 1 and if it is not, it returns 0. However, the intended purpose of this condition is likely to check if the `nums` array is empty (`nums.length == 0`) or has only one element (`nums.length == 1`), and if so, return 0. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to `if (nums.length == 0 || nums.length == 1)`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 41.38%) | Memory: 50.1 MB (Top 6.90%)

class Solution {
    public int smallestRangeI(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums.length == 0 || nums.length == 1)
            return 0;

        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : nums) {
            min = Math.min(min, num);
            max = Math.max(max, num);
        }
        int diff = max - min;

        return Math.max(0, diff - 2 * k);
    }
}
```

Now the code will correctly handle cases where the `nums` array is empty or has only one element.
