Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation: 
1. The code calculates the number of pigs required to determine which buckets contain the poison within a certain number of minutes. 
2. To solve this problem, the code uses the formula T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1, where T represents the number of rounds the pigs need to test the buckets. 
3. The loop in the code keeps subtracting the value of T from the total number of buckets until the total becomes negative. This is done to track the number of rounds required to test all the buckets. 
4. However, the code mistakenly subtracts T from the total instead of adding it. This results in an infinite loop because the total never reaches zero. 

To fix the bug, change the line "total -= T" in the loop to "total += T". This will correctly track the number of rounds required to test all the buckets until the total becomes greater than or equal to zero. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        int total = 1;
        while (total < buckets) {
            total += T; // Fixed bug: changed subtraction to addition
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
