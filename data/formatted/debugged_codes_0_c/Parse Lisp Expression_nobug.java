Bug type: NullPointerException

Reasoning:
1. The evaluate() method is called recursively to evaluate expressions.
2. In the evaluate() method, when parsing the "let" expression, new values are assigned to variables and stored in the "scope" HashMap.
3. However, the "scope" HashMap is not initialized with any values.
4. When trying to push a new value onto the stack for a variable using "scope.get(var).push(e)", a NullPointerException will occur because the "scope" HashMap is null.

Fix:
Initialize the "scope" HashMap with an empty HashMap in the constructor.

```java
class Solution {

    String expression;
    int index;
    HashMap<String, Deque<Integer>> scope;

    public Solution() {
        scope = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public int evaluate(String expression) {
        this.expression = expression;
        index = 0;
        return evaluate();
    }

    private int evaluate() {
        // implementation remains the same
    }

    // implementation remains the same
}
```
