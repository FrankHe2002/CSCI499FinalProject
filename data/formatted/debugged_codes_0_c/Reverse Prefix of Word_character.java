The bug in the provided code is in the line where the result string `res` is created and populated. The size of the `res` array is set to `word.length()`, which may result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when trying to access indices larger than `locate` in the second for loop.

To fix this bug, we can change the size of the `res` array to `word.length()+1`, which will accommodate the characters up to and including `locate`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String reversePrefix(String word, char ch) {
        char[] c = word.toCharArray();

        int locate = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) { // first occurrence of ch
            if (ch == c[i]) {
                locate = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        char[] res = new char[word.length() + 1]; // increase the size of res by 1
        for (int i = 0; i <= locate; i++) {
            res[i] = c[locate - i];
        }
        for (int i = locate + 1; i < word.length(); i++) {
            res[i] = c[i];
        }
        return String.valueOf(res); // added semicolon
    }
}
```

The bug type in this case is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Identifying the bug involved analyzing the code and examining how the `res` array is being populated. By considering the size of the `res` array and the indices accessed in the second for loop, we can determine that the bug is related to the array size being too small. Applying the fix involved increasing the size of the `res` array by 1 to avoid the exception.
