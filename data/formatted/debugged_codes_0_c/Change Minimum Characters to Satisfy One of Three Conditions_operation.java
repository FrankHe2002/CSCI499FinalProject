The bug in the provided code is in the for loop that calculates the value of `aTillCurrent`, `bTillCurrent`, and updates `globalMin`. 

1. In the for loop, `i` is initialized to 0 and the loop condition is set to `i < 25`. This means that the loop will only iterate from 0 to 24, excluding the last index 25.
2. Inside the loop, `bTillCurrent` is divided by `bCount[i]`, but since `i` ranges from 0 to 24, this division will be performed using `bCount[24]`, which is not initialized and will have a default value of 0.
3. This will result in division by zero and will throw an ArithmeticException at runtime.

To fix this bug, we need to update the loop condition to `i < 26` to include the last index. Additionally, we should check if `bCount[i]` is greater than 0 before performing the division to avoid division by zero.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCharacters(String a, String b) {
        int[] aCount = new int[26];
        int aMax = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {
            aCount[a.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            aMax = Math.max(aMax, aCount[a.charAt(i) - 'a']);
        }

        int[] bCount = new int[26];
        int bMax = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < b.length(); i++) {
            bCount[b.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            bMax = Math.max(bMax, bCount[b.charAt(i) - 'a']);
        }
        int condition3 = a.length() - aMax + b.length() - bMax;

        int globalMin = condition3;

        int aTillCurrent = 0;
        int bTillCurrent = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) { // Fixed: changed the loop condition to i < 26
            aTillCurrent += aCount[i];
            if (bCount[i] > 0) {
                bTillCurrent += bCount[i];
            }
            globalMin = Math.min(globalMin, bTillCurrent + a.length() - aTillCurrent);
