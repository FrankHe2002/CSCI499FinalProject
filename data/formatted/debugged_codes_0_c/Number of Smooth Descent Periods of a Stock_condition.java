Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
- The code is intended to calculate the number of descent periods in the given array of prices.
- A descent period is defined as a consecutive sequence of numbers where each number is 1 less than the previous number.
- The code iterates through the array using two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` represents the start of the current subarray and `j` represents the current element being checked.
- If `prices[j - 1] - prices[j] != 1`, it means that the descent period has ended and a new subarray can start from `j`. In this case, the count of subarrays, `count`, should be updated by adding `(j - i + 1)` (including the current element `j`). The count should then be added to the total answer, `ans`.
- If `prices[j - 1] - prices[j] == 1`, it means that the current element `j` cannot be part of the previous subarrays. In this case, the start pointer `i` should be updated to `j`, indicating that a new subarray starts from here. The total answer, `ans`, should be incremented by 1.
- The code correctly updates `i`, `ans`, and `j` based on the conditions.

To fix the bug:
- The bug is due to an incorrect condition used to check if `prices[j - 1] - prices[j] != 1`.
- Currently, the condition is checking if the difference between the two consecutive numbers is not equal to 1.
- However, the correct condition to check if the numbers are in descending order (descent period) is `prices[j - 1] - prices[j] == 1`.
- To fix the bug, change the condition to `prices[j - 1] - prices[j] == 1`.

        long ans = 1;
        while (j < prices.length) {
            if (prices[j - 1] - prices[j] == 1) {
                //It means that j(current element) can be part of previous subarrays (j-i)
                //and
