The code appears to have a bug in the second while loop where we are merging the remaining elements from the second array `nums2` into the first array `nums1`. 

```java
while (j < 0)
    nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
```

The condition `j < 0` will never be true because `j` is initialized as `n - 1` and only decremented by 1 in the previous while loop. As a result, the loop will never execute and we will not merge the remaining elements from `nums2` into `nums1`.

To fix this bug, we can change the condition to `j >= 0` so that the loop executes as long as there are remaining elements in `nums2` to be merged.

```java
while (j >= 0)
    nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
```
