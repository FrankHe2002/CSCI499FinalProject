Bug Type: Syntax Error

The bug is in the line:
```java
int idx = * 1;
```

The asterisk (*) should not be present in this line. It seems like a typo, as there is no apparent reason for the asterisk to be there. The correct line should be:
```java
int idx = 0;
```

This will initialize the variable `idx` to 0, which represents the index of the '0' element in the input string.
