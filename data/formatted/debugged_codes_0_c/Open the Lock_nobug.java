Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from 0 to the target.
2. It checks all possible combinations by rotating the wheels in two directions (1 to 0 or 9, and 9 to 0 or 8), and adds the resulting numbers to the queue for further exploration.
3. However, there is a logical error in the code.
4. In the condition `elem / i % 10 == 0`, it checks if the current digit of the element is 0. If it is, it adds `i` (which is 1, 10, 100, or 1000 depending on the digit's position) to the element to rotate the wheel towards 1. However, this is incorrect because it should actually rotate the wheel towards 9. The same error occurs in the `else if (elem / i % 10 == 9)` condition.
5. This bug causes the code to generate incorrect combinations and miss some correct combinations, leading to incorrect results.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to swap the values of `num1` and `num2` in the `if` and `else if` conditions to correctly rotate the wheels towards 9.

        if (visited.contains(0)) {
            return - 1;
        }
        q.add(0);
        visited.add(0);
        int level = 0;
        while (q.size() > 0) {
            int size = q.size();
            while (size-- > 0) {
                int elem = q.remove();
                if (t == elem) {
                    return level;
                }
                for (int i = 1; i < 10000; i = i * 10) {
                    int num1;
                    int num2;
                    if (elem / i % 10 == 0) {
                        num1 = elem - i * 9;  // Fix: Rotate towards
