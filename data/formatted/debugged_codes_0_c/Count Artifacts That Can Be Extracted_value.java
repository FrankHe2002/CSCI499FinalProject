The bug in the provided Java code lies in the nested for loop where the coordinates of the artifacts are checked against the coordinates in the set. 

The fix for this bug is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 198 ms (Top 10.48%) | Memory: 160.5 MB (Top 2.16%)
class Solution {
    public int digArtifacts(int n, int[][] artifacts, int[][] dig) {
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int d[] : dig) set.add(d[0] + " " + d[1]);
        int c = 0;
        for (int a[] : artifacts) {
            boolean done = true;
            for (int i = a[0]; i <= a[2]; i++) {
                for (int j = a[1]; j <= a[3]; j++) {
                    if (!set.contains(i + " " + j)) {
                        done = false;
                        break; // Added break statement to exit nested loop
                    }
                }
                if (!done) { // Added a check to break out of outer loop as well
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (done) c++;
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```

Explanation of bug identification and fix:

1. The nested for loop checks the coordinates of the artifacts against the coordinates in the set. However, if the first coordinate combination is not in the set, the loop continues checking the remaining coordinates, which is incorrect. To fix this, a `break` statement should be added to exit the inner loop if the coordinate combination is not in the set.

2. Additionally, if the inner loop encounters a coordinate combination not in the set, the outer loop should be exited as well, since the artifact as a whole cannot be considered as done. To fix this, an additional check and `break` statement should be added after the inner loop.

By adding the necessary `break` statements, the bug in the code is fixed, and the nested loop correctly checks for the presence of coordinate combinations in the set.

The time complexity of the code remains the same as O(DIG + N^2).
