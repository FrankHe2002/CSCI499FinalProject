After reviewing the provided code, I have identified the following bug:

1. Line 4: There is a syntax error in the loop condition. The comparison operator `>=>` is not a valid operator in Java.

To fix this bug, I will replace `>=>` with `-=` in the loop condition.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String baseNeg2(int n) {
        StringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder(n == 0 ? "0" : "");
        for (; n != 0; n -= 1) {
            answer.append((n & 1) == 0 ? '0' : '1');
        }
        return answer.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
