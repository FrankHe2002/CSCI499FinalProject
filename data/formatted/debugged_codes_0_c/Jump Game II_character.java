In the provided code, the variable `R` is used to keep track of the max rightmost index that can be reached from the current range of indices (`L` to `R` inclusive).

The bug in the code lies in the line `R = localMaxRight;`. This line should be modified to `R = Math.max(R, localMaxRight);`

Reasoning:
1. In the given code, the variable `R` is updated with the `localMaxRight` value. This means that `R` will always be set to a value that is reachable from the current range of indices (`L` to `R`).
2. However, there might be cases where there are multiple jumps that can be made to reach a certain index, and updating `R` with just the `localMaxRight` would disregard such jumps.
3. Therefore, the correct logic is to take the maximum of the current `R` and the `localMaxRight` value.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the line `R = localMaxRight;` to `R = Math.max(R, localMaxRight);`. This change ensures that `R` is updated to the maximum reachable index, considering all possible jumps from the current range of indices.

Updated code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 82.01% | Memory: 50 MB (Top 21.41%)
class Solution {

    public int jump(int[] nums) {

        int result = 0;

        int L = 0;
        int R = 0;

        while (R < nums.length - 1) {

            int localMaxRight = 0;

            for (int i = L; i <= R; i++) {

                localMaxRight = Math.max(i + nums[i], localMaxRight);
            }

            L = R + 1;
            R = Math.max(R, localMaxRight);
            result++;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
