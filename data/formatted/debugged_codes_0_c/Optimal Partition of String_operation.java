Bug type: Logic error

Explanation:
The code is attempting to partition a string into substrings such that no character appears in more than one substring. The current implementation uses a HashMap to keep track of the characters that have appeared in the current substring. However, there is a bug in the logic:

1. If a character has already appeared in the current substring, the code increments the count and clears the HashMap to start a new substring. However, the code should not clear the HashMap completely because it still needs to keep track of the characters from previous substrings.

2. As a result of the above bug, the code incorrectly counts the number of substrings. It only counts the number of times a character appears more than once in a substring, rather than counting the number of substrings that have been partitioned.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the logic for clearing the HashMap needs to be modified. Instead of clearing the HashMap completely, we can iterate through the characters in the current substring and remove them from the HashMap.

```java
class Solution {
    public int partitionString(String s) {
        int idx = 0;
        int count = 0;
        Map<Character, Boolean> mp = new HashMap<>(); 
        while (idx < s.length()) {
            if (mp.containsKey(s.charAt(idx))) {
                count++;
                // Remove characters from the HashMap that are already in the current substring
                for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
                    mp.remove(s.charAt(i));
                }
            }
            mp.put(s.charAt(idx), true);
            idx++;
        }
        return count + 1;
    }
}
```
