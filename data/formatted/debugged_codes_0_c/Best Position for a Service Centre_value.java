Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the center of the given positions by taking the average of all x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
2. It then creates a Node object called 'center' with the calculated center coordinates and the total distance.
3. The code then enters a while loop where it tries different directions to find a new center with a smaller total distance.
4. The loop continues until the step size becomes smaller than the defined minimum step size.
5. The code uses a step size of 50 initially and divides it by 2 whenever the current center is the same as the minimum calculated center.
6. However, there is a logical error in the code where the position coordinates are not properly updated when checking for a new minimum.
7. The code calculates the new coordinates by adding the step size to the center coordinates, but it does not update the center coordinates when a new minimum is found. This results in the same coordinates being used for all directions in subsequent iterations.
8. As a result, the code enters an infinite loop and never converges to the optimal center.

Bug Fix:
To fix the bug in the code, we need to update the center coordinates whenever a new minimum is found. This can be done by assigning the coordinates of the new minimum node to the center coordinates.

```java
class Solution {
    private static final double MIN_STEP = 0.0000001;
    private static final int[][] DIRECTIONS = {{- 1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, - 1}, {0, 1}};

    public double getMinDistSum(int[][] positions) {
        double cx = 0, cy = 0;
        int n = positions.length;
        for (int[] pos : positions) {
            cx += pos[0];
            cy += pos[1];
        }
        cx /= n;
        cy /= n;
        Node center = new Node(cx, cy, totalDistance(positions, cx, cy));

        double step = 50.0;
        while (step > MIN_STEP) {
            Node min = center;
            for (int[] direction : DIRECTIONS) {
                double dx = center.x + direction[0] * step, dy = center.y + direction[1] * step;
                double totalDist = totalDistance(positions, dx, dy);
                if (totalDist < min.dist) min = new Node(dx, dy, totalDist);
            }
