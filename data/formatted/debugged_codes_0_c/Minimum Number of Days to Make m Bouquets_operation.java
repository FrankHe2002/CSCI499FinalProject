Bug: The bug in the code is in the calculation of the `mid` value in the `minDays` method. The formula to calculate `mid` is incorrect, causing incorrect values to be assigned to `mid`.

Reasoning: 
- The `minDays` method calculates the minimum number of days needed to make `m` bouquets, each consisting of `k` flowers, given the bloomDay array.
- The method initializes `low` to the maximum value of the bloomDay array and `high` to 0. These values represent the minimum and maximum bloom days, respectively.
- The method then enters a while loop in which it calculates the `mid` value as `low + (high - low) - 2`.
- The `isPossible` method is then called with the calculated `mid` value.
- Depending on the result of `isPossible`, the `high` or `low` value is adjusted in order to narrow down the search for the minimum number of days.

The bug in the code is that the calculation of `mid` is incorrect. The line `int mid = low + (high - low) - 2;` should be changed to `int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;`. This will correctly calculate the midpoint between `low` and `high`.

Additionally, the initial check in the `minDays` method for `m * k > bloomDay.length` is incorrect. It should return `-1` when the condition is not satisfied. The line `if (m * k > bloomDay.length) return - 1;` should be changed to `if (m * k > bloomDay.length) return -1;` to fix this bug.

Corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDays(int[] bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        if (m * k > bloomDay.length) return -1;

        int low = Integer.MAX_VALUE, high = 0;
        for (int i : bloomDay) {
            low = Math.min(low, i);
            high = Math.max(high, i);
        }
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isPossible(bloomDay, mid, m, k)) high = mid - 1;
            else low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
