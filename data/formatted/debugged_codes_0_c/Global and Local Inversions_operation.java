The provided code checks if each element in the array `nums` is at most 1 position away from its correct position. If any element is more than 1 position away, the code returns `false`, indicating that the array does not satisfy the condition of having only "ideal" permutations.

The bug in the code lies in the condition `Math.abs(nums[i] - i) > 1`. This condition is checking if the absolute difference between the current element and its index is greater than 1, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `Math.abs(nums[i] - i) != 1`, checking if the absolute difference is not equal to 1.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the code. Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isIdealPermutation(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (Math.abs(nums[i] - i) != 1) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code will correctly check if each element is only 1 position away from its correct position and return the appropriate result.
