Bug type: Index out of bounds error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is a dynamic programming solution to solve a problem, but it seems to have a bug.
2. The bug is likely to be related to the index out of bounds error since the code is accessing elements outside the bounds of arrays.
3. In the `cut` function, the line `int cost = cuts[j + 1] - cuts[i - 1] + cut(cuts, i, k - 1, dp) + cut(cuts, k + 1, j, dp);` is causing the index out of bounds error.
4. The error occurs because the indices `j + 1` and `i - 1` are being accessed, which can go beyond the bounds of the `cuts` array.
5. The fix can be applied by adjusting the indices properly to avoid accessing elements outside the array bounds.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minCost(int n, int[] cuts) {

        int len = cuts.length;

        Arrays.sort(cuts);

        int[] arr = new int[len + 2];
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++)
            arr[i] = cuts[i - 1];

        arr[0] = 0;
        arr[len + 1] = n;
        int[][] dp = new int[len + 1][len + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++)
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], -1);
        return cut(arr, 1, len, dp);
    }

    int cut(int[] cuts, int i, int j, int[][] dp) {
        if (i > j)
            return 0;

        if (dp[i][j] != -1)
            return dp[i][j];

        int mini = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
            int cost = cuts[j] - cuts[i - 1] + cut(cuts, i, k - 1, dp) + cut(cuts, k + 1, j, dp);
            mini = Math.min(cost, mini);
        }

        return dp[i][j] = mini;
    }
}
```

Explanation: 
1. The main change made in the code is in the line `int cost = cuts[j] - cuts[i - 1] + cut
