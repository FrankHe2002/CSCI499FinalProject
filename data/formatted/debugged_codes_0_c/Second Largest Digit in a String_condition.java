Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes an integer array `arr` with a size of 10.
2. The code then iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
3. For each character, it checks if the character is a digit by subtracting the character '0' from it and comparing it against 9.
4. If the character is a digit, it increments the corresponding index in the `arr` array.
5. Finally, it iterates over the `arr` array from 9 to 0, and when it encounters a non-zero value, it returns that index as the second highest digit.

Bug:
There is a logical error in the condition `s.charAt(i) - '0' < 0` while checking if the character is a digit. This condition will never be true because `s.charAt(i) - '0'` will always be >= 0 since '0' is subtracted from a digit character.

Fix:
Change the logical AND (`&`) to a logical OR (`|`) in the condition `s.charAt(i) - '0' <= 9 & s.charAt(i) - '0' < 0` to fix the bug.

Updated code with the fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int secondHighest(String s) {
        int[] arr = new int[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) - '0' <= 9 | s.charAt(i) - '0' < 0) {
                arr[s.charAt(i) - '0']++;
            }
        }
        boolean first = false;
        for (int i = 9; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (arr[i] != 0) {
                if (first)
                    return i;
                else first = true;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
