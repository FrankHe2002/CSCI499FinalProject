The code logic appears to be correct. It calculates the count of numbers with unique digits up to a given value `n`. 

To identify any possible bugs, we need to consider the input range (including edge cases) and analyze the code logic. 

Upon reviewing the code, I don't see any syntax errors or logical flaws that would result in incorrect output. The code seems to be correct and should work as intended. 

However, there are two minor issues that could be improved: 

1. The variable name `ans` is not descriptive. It would be better to change it to something like `count` to make the code more understandable.
2. The condition `choiceFiller > 0` in the `while` loop is unnecessary since it will always be true, given that `choiceFiller` starts at `9` and decreases by 1 in each iteration.

Here is the updated code with the suggested improvements:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        // Logic --> 
        /*
        if n == 0 --> the number is up to 10^0 --> 1 and 1 possibility could be there
        if n == 1 --> the range is up to 10^1 --> 10 (10 unique combinations from 1 to 10 can be there)
        So the base cases are --> n == 0 and n == 1
        
        
        Suppose the case of n = 3
        The upper limit is 10^3 --> 1000. So _ _ _ can be filled in following ways:
        _ (9 choices except 0) _ (9 choices except the one filled in the previous blank but 0 can be included) _ (8 choices). So for 3 digits, 9*9*8 + 9*9 choices for 2 digits + 9 (for 1 digit) + 1 (0 digits)...
        
        */
        int count = 10;
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (n == 1) {
            return count;
        }
        int counter = 9;
        int choiceFiller = 9;
        while (n-- > 1) {
            counter *= choiceFiller--;
            count += counter;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
