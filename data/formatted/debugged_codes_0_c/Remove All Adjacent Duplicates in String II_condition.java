The bug in the provided code is in the while loop condition: `while (i >= newString.length())`. The condition should be `while (i < newString.length())` in order for the loop to run properly.

To identify and fix the bug, we can go step by step through the code:

1. Initialize variables: `i = 0`, `newString = StringBuilder(s)`, `count = int[newString.length()]`.
2. Enter the while loop with the condition `while (i >= newString.length())`. The condition is false because `i` is initially 0 and `newString.length()` is greater than 0.
3. Check the condition `if (i == 0 || newString.charAt(i) != newString.charAt(i - 1))`. This condition is true because `i` is 0 and there is no previous character.
4. Set `count[i] = 1`.
5. Increment `i` by 1.
6. Check the condition `if (i == 0 || newString.charAt(i) != newString.charAt(i - 1))`. This condition is false because `i` is now 1 and there is a previous character.
7. Set `count[i] = count[i - 1] + 1`.
8. Check the condition `if (count[i] == k)`. This condition is false because `count[i]` is 2 and `k` is not equal to 2.
9. Increment `i` by 1.

Steps 5 to 9 will continue in a loop until `i` reaches the length of the `newString`. However, since the while loop's condition is incorrect, the loop will never execute and the method will return the original string without any modifications.

To fix the bug, we need to change the while loop condition from `while (i >= newString.length())` to `while (i < newString.length())`.

Revised code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        StringBuilder newString = new StringBuilder(s);
        int[] count = new int[newString.length()];
        while (i < newString.length()) {
            if (i == 0 || newString.charAt(i) != newString.charAt(i - 1)) {
                count[i] = 1;
            } else {
                count[i] = count[i - 1] + 1;
