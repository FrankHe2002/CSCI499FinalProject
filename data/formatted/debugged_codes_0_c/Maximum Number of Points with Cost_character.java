Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code aims to find the maximum sum of values in a matrix based on certain conditions.
2. The code uses a frame array to store the most effective values that will later be added to the next row.
3. The code iterates through each row of the matrix and updates the values in the frame based on the conditions.
4. Finally, the code finds the maximum value in the frame and returns it as the result.

Identifying the bug:
The code seems to have a logical error in the logic of updating the frame array. 

- In the first loop, the code correctly adds the values from the current row to the frame.
- In the second loop, the code updates the frame values from left to right, but it incorrectly subtracts 1 from the previous value (`frame[j-1] - 1`). This subtraction is not needed and can lead to incorrect results.
- In the third loop, the code updates the frame values from right to left, but it also incorrectly subtracts 1 from the following value (`frame[j+1] - 1`). This subtraction is not needed and can lead to incorrect results.

Applying the fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary subtraction of 1 in the second and third loops.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public long maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        long[] frame = new long[points[0].length];

        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < frame.length; j++) frame[j] += points[i][j];

            for (int j = 1; j < frame.length; j++) frame[j] = Math.max(frame[j], frame[j - 1]);

            for (int j = frame.length - 2; j >= 0; j--) frame[j] = Math.max(frame[j], frame[j + 1]);

            for (long k : frame) System.out.println(k);
        }

        long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < frame.length; i++) {
            ans = Math.max(ans, frame[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

In this fix, I removed the unnecessary subtraction of 1 in the second and third loops when updating the frame values.
