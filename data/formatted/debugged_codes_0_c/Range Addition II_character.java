The bug in the provided code is that the return statement is placed inside the for loop. This means that the calculation and return of `minRow * minCol` will be prematurely executed after the first iteration of the loop.

To fix this bug, we need to move the return statement outside the for loop so that it is executed after all the iterations.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        int minRow = m, minCol = n;
        for (int[] op : ops) {
            minRow = Math.min(minRow, op[0]);
            minCol = Math.min(minCol, op[1]);
        }
        
        return minRow * minCol;
    }
}
```
