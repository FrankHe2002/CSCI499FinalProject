There doesn't appear to be any bug in the provided code. The code defines a class `Solution` with a method `hammingWeight` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of '1' bits in its binary representation.

To verify the correctness of the code, we can break it down and analyze it step-by-step:

1. The code uses the `Integer.bitCount()` method, which counts the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of an integer. This method has been specifically implemented to work correctly with both signed and unsigned integers.

2. The code is already using the correct method to count the '1' bits, so no modifications are necessary.

Therefore, there is no bug present in the provided code.

If there was a bug, it could have been identified by carefully analyzing and understanding the code. Common types of bugs in similar scenarios could include logical errors, typos, or incorrect algorithms. In those cases, debugging techniques like logging, stepping through the code, or using a debugger can assist in identifying and fixing the bug.

Since there is no bug, no changes are required to fix the code.
