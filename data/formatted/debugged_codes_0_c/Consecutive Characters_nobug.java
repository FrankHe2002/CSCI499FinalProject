The code appears to be using a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of consecutive characters in the given string 's'. 

To identify and fix the bug, I will first analyze the logic of the code:

1. Initialize 'maxConsecutive' and 'counterConsecutive' to 1.
2. Iterate through each character in the string 's' using a for loop.
3. Compare the current character with the next character in 's'.
4. If they are the same, increment 'counterConsecutive' and update 'maxConsecutive' with the larger value of 'counterConsecutive' and 'maxConsecutive'.
5. If they are different, reset 'counterConsecutive' to 1.
6. Return 'maxConsecutive' after the loop.

The code logic seems correct, but there is a bug in the loop's termination condition. The loop should iterate until 'i < s.length()' instead of 'i < s.length() - 1'. This is because the last character of the string is not being checked in the current implementation.

Here is the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPower(String s) {
        int maxConsecutive = 1;
        int counterConsecutive = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) { // fixed loop termination condition
            if (i < s.length() - 1 && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1)) { // added check for last character
                counterConsecutive++;
                maxConsecutive = Math.max(counterConsecutive, maxConsecutive);
            } else {
                counterConsecutive = 1;
            }
        }
        return maxConsecutive;
    }
}
```

Now the code will correctly iterate through all characters of the string 's' and find the maximum number of consecutive characters.
