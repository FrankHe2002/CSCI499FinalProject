Bug type: Logic bug

Reasoning:
1. The code starts by creating a duplicate array of `heights` using `Arrays.copyOfRange()`.
2. It then sorts `dupheights` using `Arrays.sort()`.
3. The code then iterates over `heights` and checks if each element is different from the corresponding element in `dupheights`. If it is, it increments `count`.
4. Finally, `count` is returned.

The bug:
The bug lies in the logic of comparing the elements of `heights` with the corresponding elements of `dupheights`. The code assumes that if an element in `heights` is not equal to the corresponding element in `dupheights`, it means that the height at that index has been changed. However, the code fails to consider the possibility that the heights at other indices may have also changed, resulting in the elements being correctly sorted but not in their original positions.

The fix:
To fix the bug and accurately count the number of elements that have changed their position, we need to compare the elements of `heights` with the elements of `dupheights` after their respective indices are sorted.

```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {

        int[] dupheights = Arrays.copyOfRange(heights, 0, heights.length);

        Arrays.sort(dupheights);
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {

            if (heights[i] != dupheights[i]) {
                count++;
            }

        }

        return count;

    }
}
```
