The code seems to implement the previous permutation of an array. To identify the bug, we need to understand the logic of the code and analyze the variables and loops.

1. The variable `small` is incorrectly initialized with `arr[n - 1]` instead of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This causes incorrect comparison later in the code.
2. The variable `prev` is correctly initialized with `arr[n - 1]` as the previous element.
3. The loop starts from the second-to-last element (`i = n - 2`) and iterates backward until the first element (`i = 0`).

Within the loop:
1. If the current element (`arr[i]`) is greater than the previous element (`prev`), update the `prev` variable.
2. If the current element (`arr[i]`) is less than or equal to the previous element (`prev`), find the largest element (`te`) that is smaller than `arr[i]` and occurs to the right of `arr[i]`. Update `indte` with the index of this element.
3. Swap `arr[i]` with `arr[indte]`.
4. Return the modified array (`arr`).

If no swap occurs in the loop, it means we have the lexicographically smallest permutation of the array.

To fix the bug and make minimal changes to the code, we need to:
1. Initialize the variable `small` with `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
2. Replace the name `indte` with `swapIndex` and `te` with `swapValue` for clarity.
3. Swap the values directly instead of using a temporary variable.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] prevPermOpt1(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int small = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int prev = arr[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (arr[i] > prev) {
                prev = arr[i];
            } else {
                int swapIndex = i;
                int swapValue = 0;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    if (arr[j] < arr[i] && arr[j] > swapValue) {
                        swapValue = arr[j];
                        swapIndex = j;
                    }
                }
                arr[swapIndex] = arr[i];
                arr[i] = swapValue
