Bug Type: Logic Error

Explanation:
1. The code uses a HashMap to count the occurrences of each element in the `arr` array.
2. Then, it iterates over the `target` array and checks if each element exists in the HashMap. If an element is found, the count of that element is decremented in the HashMap.
3. If at the end the HashMap is not empty, it means that there are elements in `arr` that are not in `target`, so the code returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The bug in this code is in the last few lines:
```java
if (hm1.size() != 0)
    return true;

return false;
```
The condition should actually be `if (hm1.size() == 0)` instead of `if (hm1.size() != 0)`.

Fix:
```java
if (hm1.size() == 0)
    return true;

return false;
```
