The bug in the code is in the `dfs` method. 

The bug occurs when checking if a neighbor node has been visited or not. 

In the line `if (visited[n.val] != null)`, the code is checking if the visited array at index `n.val` is not null. However, since the visited array is initialized with `Node[] visited = new Node[101];`, it will always contain nodes even if they have not been visited yet. So this condition will always evaluate to true and the code will never create a new node for unvisited neighbors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the visited array at index `n.val` has a value of `null` or if the value of `visited[n.val]` is equal to `copy`. If either of these conditions is true, it means the neighbor node has not been visited yet, so we should create a new node and proceed with the DFS. The modified condition should be `if (visited[n.val] == null || visited[n.val] == copy)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void dfs(Node node, Node copy, Node[] visited) {
        visited[copy.val] = copy;

        for (Node n : node.neighbors) {
            if (visited[n.val] == null || visited[n.val] == copy) {
                Node newNode = new Node(n.val);
                copy.neighbors.add(newNode);
                dfs(n, newNode, visited);
            } else {
                copy.neighbors.add(visited[n.val]);
            }
        }
    }

    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        Node copy = new Node(node.val);
        Node[] visited = new Node[101];
        Arrays.fill(visited, null);
        dfs(node, copy, visited);
        return copy;
    }
}
```
