Based on the provided Java code, there is a bug in the logic. 

The bug is in the line `i = hash.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1;`. This line is incorrectly updating the variable `i` to the index of the repeated character plus one. This means that when a repeated character is found, the loop will continue from the incorrect index, skipping some characters in between.

To fix this bug, we need to find the correct index to continue from by using the maximum of the current value of `i` and the index of the repeated character plus one. This will ensure that we continue from the correct index and do not skip any characters.

Here is the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> hash = new HashMap<>();
        int count = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (hash.containsKey(s.charAt(i))) {
                int repeatIndex = hash.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1;
                i = Math.max(i, repeatIndex);
                hash.clear();
                count = 0;
            }
            if (!hash.containsKey(s.charAt(i))) {
                hash.put(s.charAt(i), i);
                count++;
                ans = Math.max(ans, count);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Now, the code will correctly handle repeated characters and find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
