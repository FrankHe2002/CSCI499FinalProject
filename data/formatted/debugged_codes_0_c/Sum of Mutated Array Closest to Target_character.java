One bug in the provided Java code is a missing semicolon after the line `int l = 0`.

To identify this bug, we can review the code line by line and look for any syntax errors. In this case, we can see that there is a missing semicolon after the line `int l = 0`. This is a syntax error in Java and needs to be fixed by adding a semicolon.

To fix the bug, we can simply add a semicolon after the line `int l = 0`, like this:

```java
int l = 0;
```

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 6.67%) | Memory: 47.2 MB (Top 65.28%)
class Solution {
    int max = 0;
    int len;

    public int findBestValue(int[] arr, int target) {
        this.len = arr.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
            max = Math.max(max, arr[i]);

        int l = 0;
        int r = max;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;

            if (check(arr, mid, target) <= check(arr, mid + 1, target))
                r = mid;
            else
                l = mid + 1;
        }
        return l;
    }

    private int check(int[] arr, int value, int target) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int e : arr) {
            if (e > value)
                sum += value;
            else
                sum += e;
        }

        return Math.abs(sum - target);
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed.
