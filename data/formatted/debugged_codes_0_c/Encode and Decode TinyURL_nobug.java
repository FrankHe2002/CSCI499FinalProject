There doesn't appear to be any obvious bugs in this code. The `encode` function simply returns the input string, and the `decode` function also simply returns the input string. Both functions do not modify or manipulate the input in any way.

If there was a particular bug that we were looking for, we would need more information or requirements to determine what the bug might be. As it stands, the code seems to be functioning as intended, albeit without any functionality beyond returning the input.

If the intention is to actually encode and decode URLs, the current implementation is insufficient. In that case, we could use a library or algorithm to encode and decode the URLs, such as with Base64 encoding. Here's an example of how the code could be modified to use Base64 encoding:

```java
import java.util.Base64;

public class Codec {

    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    public String encode(String longUrl) {
        return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(longUrl.getBytes());
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    public String decode(String shortUrl) {
        byte[] decodedBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(shortUrl);
        return new String(decodedBytes);
    }
}
```
