The bug in the provided code is that it does not handle the case when the exponent `n` is negative and `n` is odd. In this case, the code incorrectly computes the result.
To identify and fix the bug, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify the bug: The bug occurs when `n` is negative and `n` is odd, because the code only checks for evenness or oddness of `n` without taking into account its sign.
2. Understand the expected behavior: The `myPow` method is expected to compute `x` raised to the power of `n`, and return the result as a double.
3. Analyze the code: 
  - If `n` is 0, the code returns 1.
  - If `n` is 1, the code returns `x`.
  - If `n` is -1, the code returns `1 / x`.
  - Otherwise, the code recursively computes `myPow` by dividing `n` by 2 and multiplying the result by itself. Depending on the parity of `n`, it then multiplies the result by `x` or `1 / x`.
4. Identify the bug type: The bug in the code is a logical bug.
5. Apply the fix: The fix is to specifically check for the case when `n` is negative and `n` is odd, and multiply the result by `1 / x` instead of `x`.
```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return x;
        else if (n == -1) return 1 / x;
        double res = myPow(x, n / 2);
        if (n % 2 == 0) return res * res;
        else if (n < 0 && n % 2 == -1) return res * res * (1 / x);
        else return res * res * x;
    }
}
```
