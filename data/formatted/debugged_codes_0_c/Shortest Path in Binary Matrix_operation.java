The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug in the provided Java code:

1. The first step is to understand the purpose of the code. It appears to be solving the problem of finding the shortest path in a binary matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the starting point to the destination.

2. The bug type may involve incorrect return value or incorrect condition checking.

3. Upon reviewing the code, the following bug is identified:
   - In the "if (grid[0][0] == 1 || grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 1)" condition, the return statement is incorrect. It multiplies the result by 1 instead of returning -1.

4. The bug can be fixed by changing the return statement to "return -1" instead of "return * 1".

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

class Solution {
    public int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;

        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];

        int[] up = {0, 0, 1, - 1, 1, 1, - 1, - 1};
        int[] down = {- 1, 1, 0, 0, - 1, 1, - 1, 1};

        if (grid[0][0] == 1 || grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 1)
            return -1;

        ArrayDeque<int[]> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        q.add(new int[] {0, 0, 1});

        while (q.size() > 0) {
            int[] tmp = q.removeFirst();
            int x = tmp[0];
            int y = tmp[1];
            int steps = tmp[2];
            visited[x][y] = true;

            if (x == m - 1 && y == n - 1)
                return steps;

            for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
                int x_new = x + up[i];
                int y_new = y + down[i];
                if (x_new >= 0 && x_new < m && y_new >= 0 && y_new < n) {
                    if (visited[x_new][
