Based on the provided code, one potential bug can be identified at the line:
```
arr[gue - '-1']--;
```

The bug type in this case is a syntax error. The subtraction operator in this line seems to be incorrectly written as `'-1'`, which would result in a String value. However, it is likely that the intention was to subtract `1` from `gue - '0'`. 

To fix the bug, the code should be modified by replacing `arr[gue - '-1']--;` with `arr[gue - '0']--;`. This change will correctly subtract 1 from the value in the `arr` array index corresponding to the digit represented by `gue`.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        int arr[] = new int[10], bulls = 0, cows = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < secret.length(); i++) {
            char sec = secret.charAt(i);
            char gue = guess.charAt(i);
            if (sec == gue) bulls++;
            else {
                if (arr[sec - '0'] < 0) cows++;
                if (arr[gue - '0'] > 0) cows++;
                arr[sec - '0']++;
                arr[gue - '0']--; // Fix made here
            }
        }
        return new StringBuilder(String.valueOf(bulls)).append("A").append(cows).append("B").toString();
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code should now correctly calculate the number of bulls and cows and return the desired result.
