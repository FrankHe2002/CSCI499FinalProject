The provided code is checking if each element in the `nums` array has either 2 digits, 4 digits, or is equal to 100000. If any of these conditions are true, it increments the `count` variable.

There is a bug in the condition checking for 4 digits. The current condition is `val > 999 && val < 10000`, which will only include values between 1000 and 9999. However, the condition should be `val > 999 && val < 10000`, which will include values between 1000 and 9999. This bug will exclude any 4-digit numbers in the range of 10000 to 99999.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `val > 9999 && val < 100000`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            if ((val > 9 && val < 100) || (val > 9999 && val < 100000) || val == 100000)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
