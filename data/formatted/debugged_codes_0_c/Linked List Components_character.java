The provided Java code may contain a logical bug. Here's the step-by-step process to identify and fix the bug:

1. The code starts by initializing the count to 0 and creating a HashSet called `set` to store the values from the `nums` array.
2. Iterating through the `nums` array, the code adds each element to the HashSet `set`.
3. Then, the code enters a while loop which loops until the `head` node becomes null.
4. Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of the current `head` node is present in the `set`.
5. If it is present, it enters another while loop that continues as long as the next node is not null and its value is also in the `set`.
6. Inside this inner while loop, it updates the `head` node to the next node.
7. After that, it increments the `count` variable and exits the inner while loop.
8. Finally, it updates the `head` node to the next node.

Based on the provided code, there seems to be a logical bug in the last line of the outer while loop.
```java
head = head.next;
```
The problem is that the `head` node is updated to the next node unconditionally at the end of each iteration of the outer while loop, regardless of whether `count` is updated or not. This means that even if the current `head` node is not present in the `set`, the code skips to the next node without checking it, which leads to an incorrect count.

To fix this issue, we should only update the `head` node to the next node if it is not present in the `set`. This can be done by wrapping the last line of the code block inside an if statement:

```java
if (!set.contains(head.next.val)) {
    head = head.next;
}
```

Here's the modified code with the fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numComponents(ListNode head, int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            set.add(nums[i]);
        }
        while (head != null) {
            if (set.contains(head.val)) {
                while (head.next != null && set.contains(head.next.val)) {
                    head = head.next;
                }
                count++;
            }
            if (head != null && !set
