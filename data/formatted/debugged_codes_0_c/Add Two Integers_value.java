Reading through the code, it seems to be implementing a binary search algorithm to find the sum of two numbers, `num1` and `num2`. The algorithm starts with a range, `l` to `r`, initialized to -200 and 200 respectively. The algorithm then repeatedly updates the range based on whether the midpoint, `mid`, is less than or greater than the sum of `num1` and `num2`. 

Looking at the binary search implementation, there doesn't appear to be any logical errors. However, there is a simple typo in the line `if (mid < num1 + num2) l = mid + 2;`. The `2` should be changed to `1` to correctly update the left boundary when `mid` is smaller than the sum.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sum(int num1, int num2) {
        int l = - 200, r = 200;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
            if (mid == num1 + num2) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (mid < num1 + num2) l = mid + 1;
            if (mid > num1 + num2) r = mid - 1;
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```

By changing `l = mid + 2;` to `l = mid + 1;`, we fix the bug in the code.
