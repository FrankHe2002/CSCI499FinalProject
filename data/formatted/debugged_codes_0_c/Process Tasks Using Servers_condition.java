Bug Type: Comparison Bug

Reasoning Process:
1. The code uses two priority queues to keep track of available servers and processing servers.
2. The availableServer priority queue is sorted based on the server weight, and if the weights are equal, based on the server index.
3. The processingServer priority queue is sorted based on the server's free time, and if the free times are equal, based on the server weight, and if the weights are equal, based on the server index.
4. The bug is most likely present in the comparison logic of the processingServer priority queue, where it checks if the free times are equal.

Fix:
Change the comparison `(a[1] != b[1])` in the processingServer priority queue to `(a[1] - b[1])`, which compares the server weights.
