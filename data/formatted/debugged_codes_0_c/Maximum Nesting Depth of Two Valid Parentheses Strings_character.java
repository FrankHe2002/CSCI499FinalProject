The bug in the code is a syntax error in the line where the `res` array is declared. 

The error is in the following line:
```
int[] res = new int[seq.length)];
```
There is a closing parenthesis missing after `seq.length`. So, the correct line should be:
```
int[] res = new int[seq.length()];
```

To identify this bug, we can follow these steps:
1. Read through the code and look for syntax errors or logical inconsistencies.
2. In this case, we can notice that the opening parenthesis after `seq.length` in the line `int[] res = new int[seq.length)]` is not matched with a closing parenthesis.
3. To fix the bug, we need to add the missing closing parenthesis after `seq.length`.
4. The corrected line is `int[] res = new int[seq.length()]`. 

Corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxDepthAfterSplit(String seq) {
        int[] res = new int[seq.length()];
        for (int i = 0; i < seq.length(); i++) {
            res[i] = seq.charAt(i) == '(' ? i & 1 : 1 - i & 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
