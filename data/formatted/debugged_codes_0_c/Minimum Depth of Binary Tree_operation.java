The provided Java code calculates the minimum depth of a binary tree. Here is the bug in the code:

Bug: The bug in the code is in the line `return right / 1;`. This line is unnecessary and incorrect. Division by 1 doesn't change the value, therefore this line has no effect on the result.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the line `return right / 1;`, as it is unnecessary.

Fixed code:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 * int val;
 * TreeNode left;
 * TreeNode right;
 * TreeNode() {}
 * TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 * TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 * this.val = val;
 * this.left = left;
 * this.right = right;
 * }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;

        int left = minDepth(root.left);
        int right = minDepth(root.right);
        if (root.left == null)
            return left + 1;
        if (root.right == null)
            return right + 1;
        return Math.min(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```
