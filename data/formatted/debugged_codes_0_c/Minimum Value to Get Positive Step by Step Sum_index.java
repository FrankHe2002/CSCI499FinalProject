The code is supposed to find the minimum start value such that the sum of the array elements is never less than 1. However, there is a bug in the code that causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The issue is in the line `sum += nums[sum];`. 
To fix the issue, we need to change `nums[sum]` to `nums[i]`, because we need to iterate over the array elements using the variable `i`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minStartValue(int[] nums) {
        int lowest_sum = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];  // Fix: Change nums[sum] to nums[i]
            if (lowest_sum > sum) {
                lowest_sum = sum;
            }
        }
        return 1 - lowest_sum;
    }
}
```
