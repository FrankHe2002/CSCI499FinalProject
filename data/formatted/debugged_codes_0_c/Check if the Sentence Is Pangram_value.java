Bug type: Bitwise operator bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code takes a string as input and checks if it is a pangram, i.e., if it contains all the letters of the English alphabet.
2. It initializes a variable `seen` to 0 to keep track of which letters have been seen so far.
3. It iterates over each character of the input string.
4. For each character, it calculates an index `ci` by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the character. This index represents the position of the letter in the alphabet, starting from 0 for 'a'.
5. It uses a bitwise OR operation (`|`) to set the `ci`-th bit of `seen` to 1.
6. Finally, it checks if `seen` is equal to ((1 << 26) - 1), which represents a 26-bit number with all bits set to 1.
7. If `seen` is equal to ((1 << 26) - 1), it means all letters have been seen and the string is a pangram.

Bug explanation:
The bug lies in the bitwise OR operation (`|`) used to set the `ci`-th bit of `seen` to 1. The operator used is incorrect; it should be a bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead. 

Fix:
Change the line `seen = seen | (2 << ci);` to `seen = seen | (1 << ci);`.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkIfPangram(String sentence) {
        int seen = 0;
        for (char c : sentence.toCharArray()) {
            int ci = c - 'a';
            seen = seen | (1 << ci);
        }
        return seen == ((1 << 26) - 1);
    }
}
```
