Bug Type: Null Pointer Exception

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes three class variables: `nodeInPath`, `nodeIdxInPath`, and `parent`.
2. The `fill()` method populates the `nodeInPath` and `nodeIdxInPath` arrays based on the `parent` array.
3. The bug is likely to occur in the `fill()` method since it is responsible for initializing these arrays.
4. In the `fill()` method, a loop iterates over the elements of the `parent` array starting from index 1.
5. In each iteration, the current element `i` is checked for two conditions:
   - `inner[i]` should be `false`.
   - `nodeInPath[i]` should be `null`.
6. If both conditions are satisfied, a new path is created and stored in `nodeInPath[i]`.
   - This path contains all the nodes from `i` to the root of the tree.
   - The index of `i` in this path is stored in `nodeIdxInPath[i]`.
7. The bug is likely to occur when accessing `nodeIdxInPath[node]` or `nodeInPath[node]` in the `getKthAncestor()` method.
   - If `nodeInPath[node]` is `null`, it means that the path for `node` has not been initialized in the `fill()` method.
   - Accessing `nodeIdxInPath[node]` when `nodeInPath[node]` is `null` can result in a `Null Pointer Exception`.

Fix:
1. The bug can be fixed by adding a null check before accessing `nodeInPath[node]` and `nodeIdxInPath[node]` in the `getKthAncestor()` method.
2. If `nodeInPath[node]` is `null`, return `-1` to indicate that the ancestor does not exist.
3. Here is the fixed code with minimal changes:

    int n;
    int[] parent;

    int[] nodeIdxInPath;

    public TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent) {
        this.n = n;
        this.parent = parent;
        nodeInPath = new ArrayList[n];
        nodeIdxInPath = new
