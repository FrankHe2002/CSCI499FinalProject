The bug in the provided code is in the condition for checking if `newIndex * 2 == 0`. This condition will always be false because `newIndex` is the same as `i - deletion`, and `deletion` is increased only when `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition `newIndex * 2 == 0` to `newIndex == 0`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletion(int[] nums) {
        int deletion = 0, n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ) {
            int newIndex = i - deletion;
            if (newIndex == 0 && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) deletion++;
            else i++;
        }
        return ((n - deletion) % 2 == 0) ? deletion : deletion + 1;
    }
}
```

The fixed code will correctly count the number of deletions needed.
