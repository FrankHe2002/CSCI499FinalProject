The provided Java code calculates the number of zero-filled subarrays in the given `nums` array.

To identify any potential bugs in the code, we'll follow these steps:

1. Analyze the code: The code uses a loop to iterate over the `nums` array and checks if the current element is 0. If it is, it increments the `len` variable. If the current element is not 0 and `len` is greater than 0, it calculates the sum of subarrays using the formula `(len * (len + 1)) / 2` and adds it to `ans`. Finally, it checks if there are any remaining zeros at the end of the array and adds the sum of subarrays using the same formula. The value of `ans` is then returned.

2. Inspect the logic: The logic seems correct. The code correctly counts the number of zeros in zero-filled subarrays and calculates the sum.

3. Identify any potential bugs: After analyzing the code and logic, it appears that there is no bug.

4. Apply minimal changes: Since there is no bug identified, no changes need to be made.

The code does not contain any bugs and does not require any changes.
