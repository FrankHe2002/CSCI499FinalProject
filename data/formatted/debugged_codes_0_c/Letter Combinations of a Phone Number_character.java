The bug in the provided code is in the method name `combinationchar[] digits, List<String> ll, StringBuilder sb, int idx)`. This method declaration is missing the return type.

To fix the bug, we need to add the return type `void` to the method declaration as follows:

```java
public void combination(char[] digits, List<String> ll, StringBuilder sb, int idx) {
    // method implementation..
}
```
