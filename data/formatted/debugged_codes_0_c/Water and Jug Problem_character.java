The bug in the provided code is a syntax error on line 3. The opening brace for the `gcd` method is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to add the missing opening brace on line 3.

```java
class Solution {
    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }

    public boolean canMeasureWater(int jug1Capacity, int jug2Capacity, int targetCapacity) {
        if (targetCapacity > jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity) {
            return false;
        }
        int g = gcd(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity);
        return (targetCapacity % g == 0);
    }
}
```
