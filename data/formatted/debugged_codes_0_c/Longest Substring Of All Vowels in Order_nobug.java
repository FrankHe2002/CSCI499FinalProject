The code provided aims to find the length of the longest substring in the given word that is beautiful, where a beautiful substring is defined as a substring that contains all five vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in non-decreasing order of their frequency.

Upon reviewing the code, a bug can be identified. The issue lies with the while loop condition in the inner loop. The condition should be changed from `word.charAt(i) >= word.charAt(i - 1)` to `word.charAt(i) >= word.charAt(i - 1) && verify.size() == 5`.

Explanation:
1. In the original while loop condition, only the individual characters are being compared based on their ASCII values. This condition alone doesn't guarantee that the vowels are in non-decreasing order of their frequency.
2. By adding `&& verify.size() == 5` to the loop condition, we ensure that the set `verify` contains exactly five different vowels and, as a result, the substring contains all five vowels in non-decreasing order of their frequency.
3. If the condition is not satisfied, the current substring is not beautiful. In this case, the `max` value doesn't need to be updated and the loop continues to find the next beautiful substring.
4. If the condition is satisfied, the length of the current beautiful substring is compared with the current maximum value (`max`) and the maximum length is updated if necessary.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestBeautifulSubstring(String word) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); i++) {
            int temp = 1;
            Set<Character> verify = new HashSet<>();
            verify.add(word.charAt(i - 1));
            while (i < word.length() && word.charAt(i) >= word.charAt(i - 1) && verify.size() == 5) {
                temp++;
                verify.add(word.charAt(i));
                i++;
            }
            max = verify.size() == 5 ? Math.max(max, temp) : max;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
