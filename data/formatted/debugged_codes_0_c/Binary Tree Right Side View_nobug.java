The bug in the provided Java code is in the `rightView()` method. The recursive calls to `rightView(curr.right, list, level + 1);` and `rightView(curr.left, list, level + 1);` are reversed. This means that the left side of the tree is being processed before the right side, resulting in an incorrect right side view of the binary tree.

To fix the bug, we need to swap the recursive calls to `rightView()` for the left and right children of the current node.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    // Utility Function of RightSideView
    public void rightView(TreeNode curr, List<Integer> list, int level) {
        // if, current is null, return
        if (curr == null) {
            return;
        }

        // if, level = list size
        // add current val to list
        if (level == list.size()) {
            list.add(curr.val);
        }

        // recursive call for left side view
        rightView(curr.left, list, level + 1);
        // recursive call for right side view
        rightView(curr.right, list, level + 1);
    }

    // Binary Tree Right Side View Function
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        // create a list
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        // call right view function
        rightView(root, result, 0);
        return result;
    }
}
```

After applying this fix, the code should correctly generate the right side view of a binary tree.
