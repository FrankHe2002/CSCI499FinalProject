The bug in the provided Java code is in the `dis` method. The count variable is initialized as 0, and then incremented for each iteration of the while loop. However, the count should be initialized as 1, because in each iteration of the loop, the code is moving from one number (either n1 or n2) to its immediate parent in the cycle.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize the count variable as 1 before entering the while loop.

Here is the modified code:

```java
// Runtime: 19 ms (Top 78.2%) | Memory: 89.35 MB (Top 43.5%)

class Solution {
    public int[] cycleLengthQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        int[] count = new int[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            count[i] += dis(queries[i][0], queries[i][1]);
        }
        return count;
    }

    private int dis(int n1, int n2) {
        int count = 1; // Fix: Initialize count as 1
        while (n1 != n2) {
            if (n1 > n2) n1 /= 2;
            else n2 /= 2;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- In the original code, the count variable is initialized as 0. This means that the code is not counting the first step of moving from one number to its immediate parent in the cycle.
- By initializing count as 1, we ensure that the first step is properly counted.
- The rest of the logic remains unchanged.
