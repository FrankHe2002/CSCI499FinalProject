The code is missing a closing curly brace for the `numWaterBottles` method. This is a syntax error that would result in a compilation error. 

To fix this, we can add a closing curly brace before the end of the class. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.6 MB (Top 8.35%)
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int drinkedBottles = numBottles;
        int emptyBottles = numBottles;

        while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
            int gainedBottles = emptyBottles / numExchange;

            drinkedBottles += gainedBottles;

            int unusedEmptyBottles = emptyBottles % numExchange;

            emptyBottles = gainedBottles + unusedEmptyBottles;
        }
        return drinkedBottles;
    }
}
```
