Bug type: Variable naming error

In the given code, there is a bug in the `flipEquiv` method. The bug is in the method call to `helper` on the first line of the `flipEquiv` method. The method call should pass `root1` as the first argument instead of `root2`. This is because `root1` is the root of the first tree and `root2` is the root of the second tree.

To fix the bug, the method call on the first line of `flipEquiv` should be changed to `return helper(root1, root2);`.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean flipEquiv(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        return helper(root1, root2);
    }

    private boolean helper(TreeNode x, TreeNode y) {
        if (x == null && y == null) return true;
        if (x == null || y == null || x.val != y.val) return false;
        boolean similarity = helper(x.left, y.left) && helper(x.right, y.right); // check if 2 subtrees are similar
        boolean swap = helper(x.left, y.right) && helper(x.right, y.left); // check if the 2 subtrees can be similar after swapping the left & right subtrees with each other

        return similarity || swap; // if either true, means we can flip to match both trees
    }
}
```
