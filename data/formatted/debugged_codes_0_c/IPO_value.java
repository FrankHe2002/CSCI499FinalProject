Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning Process:
1. The code initializes a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `k + 1` by `profits.length + 1`.
2. It then fills each element of the array with -1 using `Arrays.fill(row, - 1)`.
3. The code later accesses elements of `dp` using the indices `dp[k][i]`.

Given that `k` and `profits.length` are parameters passed into the `findMaximizedCapital` method, the issue could potentially arise if these parameters are not correctly defined.

Potential Fix:
1. Modify the declaration and initialization of the `dp` array to use `profits.length` as the first dimension:
   ```java
   dp = new int[profits.length + 1][k + 1];
   ```
2. Modify the filling loop to iterate over each column instead of each row:
   ```java
   for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++) {
       dp[i][j] = -1;
   }
   ```
