The bug in the provided code lies in the line `target = (target) % 2;` inside the `if` block. 
This line of code is supposed to divide the target by 2, but instead, it computes the remainder (`%`) when target is divided by 2.

To fix this bug, we should change the line to `target = target / 2;` so that the target is correctly divided by 2.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int target, int maxDoubles) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < maxDoubles; i++) {
            if (target == 1) break;

            if (target % 2 == 0) {
                ans += 1;
                target = target / 2;
            } else {
                ans += 2;
                target = (target - 1) / 2;
            }
        }
        return ans + target - 1;
    }
}
```
