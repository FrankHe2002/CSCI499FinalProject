Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
1. The code aims to find the maximum width between two vertical points in the given `points` 2D array.
2. The code first creates an array `arr` to store the x-coordinates of the points.
3. The code then sorts the `arr` array in ascending order.
4. The code initializes a variable `diff` with the smallest possible value in `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
5. The code then iterates over the `arr` array from the second element (index 1) to the last element (index L-1).
6. For each element `arr[i]`, the code calculates the difference between it and the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
7. If this difference is greater than the current value of `diff`, the code updates `diff` with the new difference.
8. Finally, the code returns `diff` as the maximum width.

Issue:
The code returns the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, rather than the maximum width between two vertical points. The logic for calculating the width is incorrect.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the last line of code to `return diff-1;`. By subtracting 1 from `diff`, we get the correct maximum width between two vertical points.

Updated code:

```java
// Runtime: 13 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 70.10 MB (Top 87.78%)
class Solution {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        int L = points.length;
        // y-coordinate of a point does not matter in width
        int arr[] = new int[L];
        for (int i = 0; i < L; i++) {
            arr[i] = points[i][0];
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr);

        int diff = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = 1; i < L; i++) {
            if ((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) > diff) {
                diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return diff - 1;
    }
}
```
