The bug in the provided code is in the `pow()` method. The method is supposed to perform modular exponentiation, but it is not correctly multiplying the `a` and `val` values. The variables `a` and `val` are both multiplied by `1l` instead of being multiplied together.

To fix this bug, the `pow()` method should be modified as follows:

```java
public long pow(long a, long b, int mod) {

    long val = a;

    long ans = 1;

    while (b > 0) {
        if ((b & 1) == 1) {
            ans = mulmod(ans, val, mod);
        }
        val = mulmod(val, val, mod);
        b = b >> 1;
    }

    return ans % mod;
}
```

The bug was identified by carefully reading and understanding the purpose of the `pow()` method. By comparing the code implementation with the expected behavior, the bug was found through a comparison mismatch. The error was fixed by correcting the multiplication of `a` and `val` inside the `pow()` method.
