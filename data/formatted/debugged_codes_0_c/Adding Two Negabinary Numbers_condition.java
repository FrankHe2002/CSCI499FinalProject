The bug in the provided code is in the for loop that is used to add the result to the `negaBinary` array. 

The reasoning process for identifying the bug can be done by reading the code step by step and understanding its logic. 

1. The code initializes an empty ArrayList called `result` to store the individual bits of the negabinary sum.
2. It sets two pointers, `pointer_1` and `pointer_2`, to the last index of `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively, to iterate through the arrays in reverse order.
3. It declares and initializes `carry`, `current`, and `sum` variables to handle the addition logic.
4. The code enters a while loop that continues until both `pointer_1` and `pointer_2` are less than 0.
5. Within the loop, it checks the values at `pointer_1` and `pointer_2` and adds them to `carry`, `current`, and `sum` variables.
6. It then adds `current` to the `result` ArrayList, decrements both pointers, and continues with the next iteration.
7. Once the loop exits, it checks if there is a non-zero `carry` and adds it to the `result` ArrayList.
8. The code then removes leading zeros from the `result` ArrayList by finding the last non-zero element and storing its index in `idx`.
9. Finally, it initializes a new array called `negaBinary` with size `len` (number of non-zero elements in `result`), and uses a for loop to fill it with the values from `result` by iterating in reverse order.

The bug is in the for loop that fills the `negaBinary` array:

```java
for (int i = 0; i > len; i++) {
    negaBinary[i] = result.get(idx);
    idx--;
}
```

The condition of the for loop, `i > len`, is incorrect. It should be `i < len` to correctly iterate over the elements of `result`.

To fix the bug, the condition of the for loop in the code should be changed from `i > len` to `i < len`:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    negaBinary[i] = result.get(idx);
    idx--;
}
```

With this change, the bug will be fixed and the code will correctly generate the negab
