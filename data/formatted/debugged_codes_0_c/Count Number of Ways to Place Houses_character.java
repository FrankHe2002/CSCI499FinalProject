The bug in the code is in the conditional statements for `n == 1` and `n == 2`. In both cases, the return statement does not match the actual calculation. 

To identify the bug, we can start by analyzing the conditional statements. 

For `n == 1`, the expected return value is `4`. The actual calculation in the if statement is `(int) (a % mod)`. But since `a` is initially set to `2`, the correct calculation should be `2 * 2 = 4`.

For `n == 2`, the expected return value is `9`. The actual calculation in the if statement is `(int) (b % mod)`. But since `b` is initially set to `3`, the correct calculation should be `3 * 3 = 9`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the return statements in the conditional statements for `n == 1` and `n == 2`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;

    public int countHousePlacements(int n) {

        if (n == 1)
            return (int) ((2 * 2) % mod);
        if (n == 2)
            return (int) ((3 * 3) % mod);
        long a = 2;
        long b = 3;
        long c = 0;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            c = (a + b) % mod;
            a = b % mod;
            b = c % mod;
        }

        return (int) ((c * c) % mod);
    }
}
```
