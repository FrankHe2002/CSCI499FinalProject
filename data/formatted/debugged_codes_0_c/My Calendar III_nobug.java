Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
- The code uses a TreeMap to store the start and end times of bookings as keys, and the number of bookings as values.
- When a new booking is made, the start time is added to the TreeMap with a value of 1, and the end time is added with a value of -1.
- The code then iterates over the TreeMap to calculate the maximum number of bookings that overlap at any given time.
- The bug lies in the logic of updating the TreeMap.
- When a new booking is made, the code increments the value of the start time by 1 and the value of the end time by -1.
- However, if there are multiple bookings with the same start or end time, this logic fails.
- In such cases, the value of start or end time should not be incremented or decremented, but rather the next available time slot should be found.

Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of updating the TreeMap when there are multiple bookings with the same start or end time.
- Instead of incrementing or decrementing the value, we should find the next available time slot.
- We can use a separate variable to keep track of the current count of bookings and update it accordingly.
- Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 197 ms (Top 36.54%) | Memory: 54.3 MB (Top 59.44%)
class MyCalendarThree {

    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map;

    int maxCount; // Track maximum number of bookings

    public MyCalendarThree() {
        map = new TreeMap<>();
        maxCount = 0;
    }

    public int book(int start, int end) {
        if (map.isEmpty()) {
            map.put(start, 1);
            map.put(end, - 1);
            maxCount = 1;
            return 1;
        }

        // Find next available time slot
        int prev = map.floorKey(start);
        int next = map.ceilingKey(start);

        int count = map.getOrDefault(prev, 0); // Get current count

        // Update count for new booking
        map.put(start, count + 1);
        map.put(end, map.getOrDefault(end, 0) - 1);

        maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count + 1); // Update maxCount

        return maxCount;
    }
}
```
