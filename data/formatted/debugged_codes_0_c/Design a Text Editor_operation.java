Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning Process:
1. Review the code for any array or string operations that could result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
2. Identify any code that accesses array or string indices using the pos variable.
3. Determine if this code could potentially go out of bounds.

In this code, the bug could occur in the following lines:
- `res.substring(0, pos)` in the cursorLeft() method
- `res.substring(pos - 10, pos)` in both cursorLeft() and cursorRight() methods

The pos variable is being used as an index for accessing substrings of the res StringBuilder object. If pos is less than 10 or greater than the length of res, it would result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the pos variable does not go out of bounds when used as an index for accessing substrings.

Here is the modified code with the fix:

```java
class TextEditor {
    StringBuilder res;
    int pos = 0;

    public TextEditor() {
        res = new StringBuilder();
    }

    public void addText(String text) {
        res.insert(pos, text);
        pos += text.length();
    }

    public int deleteText(int k) {
        int tmp = pos;
        pos -= k;
        if (pos < 0) pos = 0;
        res.delete(pos, tmp);
        return tmp - pos;
    }

    public String cursorLeft(int k) {
        pos = Math.max(pos - k, 0);
        return res.substring(Math.max(pos - 10, 0), pos);
    }

    public String cursorRight(int k) {
        pos = Math.min(pos + k, res.length());
        return res.substring(Math.max(pos - 10, 0), pos);
    }
}
```

In the modified code, the pos variable is updated using Math.max and Math.min functions to ensure that it does not go out of bounds. Additionally, the indices for substring are also calculated using Math.max function to prevent going out of bounds.
