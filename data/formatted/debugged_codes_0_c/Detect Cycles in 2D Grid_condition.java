Bug Type: Infinite Loop

Reasoning:
1. The code defines a `dfs` method which is a recursive method used for depth-first search.
2. The method takes in a 2D grid, a boolean array to track visited cells, current coordinates (i, j), previous coordinates (prevI, prevJ), and the current character.
3. The method first checks for out-of-bounds coordinates and if the current character matches the previous character.
4. If the current cell has already been visited, it returns true. This indicates that a cycle has been found.
5. It marks the current cell as visited and recursively checks in the four directions (north, south, east, west) if allowed by the previous movement.
6. The `containsCycle` method uses the `dfs` method to check for cycles in the grid.
7. It loops through each cell in the grid and if a cycle is found starting from that cell, it returns true.
8. If no cycle is found, it returns false.

Bug:
The bug in the code lies in the conditions for checking the allowed movements. In the `dfs` method, the conditions for checking north and west movements are incorrect. The correct conditions should be `i - prevI != 1` for north and `j - prevJ != -1` for west.

Fix:
Update the conditions for `north` and `west` in the `dfs` method to `i - prevI != 1` and `j - prevJ != -1` respectively.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsCycle(char[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;

        // Create a boolean array of same dimensions to keep track of visited cells
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (! visited[i][j] && dfs(grid, visited, i, j, 0, 0, grid[i][j])) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public boolean dfs(
            char[][] grid,
            boolean[][] visited,
            int i,
            int j,
            int prevI,
            int prevJ,
            char c
    ) {
        // Check for out of bounds
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid
