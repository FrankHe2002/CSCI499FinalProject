The bug in the provided code is in the inner loop where `j` is multiplied by `y`. The condition for the inner loop should be `j < bound`, not `i + j <= bound`. 

Additionally, the code does not handle the case when `x` or `y` is equal to 1 correctly. In these cases, the loop condition `i < bound` should be changed to `i <= bound`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 95.16%) | Memory: 37.2 MB (Top 99.55%)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= bound; i *= x) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= bound; j *= y) {
                int sum = i + j;
                if (sum <= bound) {
                    set.add(sum);
                }
                if (y == 1) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (x == 1) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(set);
    }
}
```

The fixed code handles the case when `x` or `y` is equal to 1. It also correctly checks if the sum `i + j` is less than or equal to `bound` before adding it to the set.
