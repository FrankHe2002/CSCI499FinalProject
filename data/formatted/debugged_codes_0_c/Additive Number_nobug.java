Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is using backtracking to check if a given string is additive. The backtrack method is called recursively to check different possibilities.
2. The parameters of the backtrack method are: the input string (num), the current index (idx), the current sum, the previous number (prev), and the length of the current sequence.
3. The base case of the recursion is when the index (idx) reaches the end of the string. At that point, the method checks if the length of the sequence is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, it returns true indicating that the string is an additive number. Otherwise, it returns false.
4. The code iterates over the remaining digits in the string starting from the current index (idx) and tries to form a new number (currLong) by appending each digit to the current number.
5. If the length of the sequence is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if the current sum is less than the new number (currLong). If it is, it breaks out of the loop since it won't be possible to form a valid additive number.
6. If the current sum is greater than the new number, it continues to the next iteration of the loop since the new number is smaller and there might be another possibility to form a valid additive number.
7. If the current sum is equal to the new number, it recursively calls the backtrack method with the updated parameters to check if the remaining digits in the string can form a valid additive number.
8. If the recursive call returns true, it means that a valid additive number is found and the method returns true.
9. If the loop finishes without finding a valid additive number, the method returns false.

Bug fix:
The code has a logic error in the condition for breaking out of the loop when the new number is 0. Instead of comparing num.charAt(idx) with '0', it should compare num.charAt(i) with '0' since i is the current index in the loop.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public boolean isAdditiveNumber(String num) {
        return backtrack(num, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    }

    public boolean backtrack(String num, int idx, long sum, long prev, int length) {
        if (idx == num.length()) {
            return length >= 3;
        }

        long currLong = 0;
