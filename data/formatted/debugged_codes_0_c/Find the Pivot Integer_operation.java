Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the value of `ans` by multiplying `n` with `n`, adding `n`, and then adding 2. 
2. It then calculates the square root of `ans` and stores it in the variable `sq`.
3. If the square of `sq` is equal to `ans`, it returns `sq`. Otherwise, it returns -1.

The bug occurs in the calculation of `ans`. The formula `(n * n + n) + 2` does not seem to have any relation to finding a pivot integer. Therefore, the code logic is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to change the calculation of `ans` to a formula that represents finding a pivot integer. A pivot integer is a number that satisfies the equation `n^2 + n + 2 = x^2` for some integer value `x`.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int pivotInteger(int n) {
        int ans = (n * n + n) + 1;
        int sq = (int) Math.sqrt(ans);
        if (sq * sq == ans) return sq;
        else return -1;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we change the calculation of `ans` to `(n * n + n) + 1` instead of `(n * n + n) + 2`. This change aligns with the equation `n^2 + n + 2 = x^2` and fixes the logic error.
