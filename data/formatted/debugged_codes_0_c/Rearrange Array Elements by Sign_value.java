There is a bug in the provided Java code.

Bug type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:

1. The code initializes the `posIdx` variable to -1 and `minusIdx` variable to -2.
2. During the iteration, when `i` is even, it increments `posIdx` and checks if `nums[posIdx]` is negative.
3. If `nums[posIdx]` is negative, it should find the next positive number by incrementing `posIdx` until it finds a positive number. Once found, it assigns `nums[posIdx]` to `res[resIdx]`.
4. Similarly, when `i` is odd, it increments `minusIdx` and checks if `nums[minusIdx]` is positive.
5. If `nums[minusIdx]` is positive, it should find the next negative number by incrementing `minusIdx` until it finds a negative number. Once found, it assigns `nums[minusIdx]` to `res[resIdx]`.
6. However, there is a bug in the `while` loops. The loops increment `posIdx` and `minusIdx` right before checking the conditions. This can cause the indices to go out of bounds when `posIdx` or `minusIdx` reaches the last index of `nums`, resulting in an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
7. The reason for this bug is that the initial values of `posIdx` and `minusIdx` are incorrect. They should be initialized to 0 and 1 respectively so that the first increment brings them to the correct starting positions.
8. To fix the bug, the initial values of `posIdx` and `minusIdx` should be changed to 0 and 1 respectively.

Fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 13 ms (Top 29.67%) | Memory: 225.1 MB (Top 38.94%)
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        int[] res = new int[nums.length];
        int resIdx = 0;
        int posIdx = 0; // Changed initial value from -1 to 0
        int minusIdx = 1; // Changed initial value from -2 to 1

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                posIdx++;
                while (nums[posIdx] < 0) posIdx++;
