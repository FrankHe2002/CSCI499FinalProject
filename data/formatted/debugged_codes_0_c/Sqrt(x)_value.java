Bug Type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code aims to calculate the square root of a given number, 'x', by incrementally increasing the variable 'answer' until 'answer' squared is greater than 'x'.
2. However, there is an off-by-one error in the code.
3. The while loop continues until 'answer' squared is less than or equal to 'x'.
4. Once it exits the loop, the code subtracts 1 from 'answer' before returning it.
5. This subtraction is incorrect, as it results in the final answer being one less than the actual square root of 'x'.

Fix:
To fix the off-by-one error, we need to remove the subtraction of 1 from the return statement. This will return the correct square root of 'x'.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        long answer = 0;
        while (answer * answer <= x) {
            answer += 1;
        }
        return (int) answer;
    }
}
```
