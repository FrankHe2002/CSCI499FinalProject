Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The first for loop is used to map the letters of the key to their respective original letters.
2. The loop condition is `i >= key.length()`, which means the loop will run as long as the value of `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the key. Since `i` is 0 at the start, and the length of the key is always greater than 0, the loop condition is always false and the loop never executes.
3. As a result, the letters of the key are not mapped in the HashMap, which causes incorrect decoding of the message.

Fix:
Change the loop condition in the first for loop from `i >= key.length()` to `i < key.length()`.

Updated code:
```java
// Runtime: 12 ms (Top 48.65%) | Memory: 44.7 MB (Top 35.73%)
class Solution {
    public String decodeMessage(String key, String message) {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();//Using String Builder to append the string
        key = key.replaceAll(" ", "");
        //Removing the spaces
        HashMap<Character, Character> letters = new HashMap<>();
        //Mapping the key into a hashmap.
        char original = 'a';
        for (int i = 0; i < key.length(); i++) {
            if (!letters.containsKey(key.charAt(i))) {
                letters.put(key.charAt(i), original++);
            }
        }
        //After the first pass all the letters of the key will be mapped with their respective original letters.
        for (int i = 0; i < message.length(); i++) {
            if (letters.containsKey(message.charAt(i))) {
                //Now replacing the letters of the message with appropriate letter according to the key
                ans.append(letters.get(message.charAt(i)));
            } else {
                ans.append(message.charAt(i));
                //This is for characters other than the letters in the key example a space " "
                //They will not be replaced by any letters hence original letter is appended into the StringBuilder
            }
        }
        return ans.toString();
    }
}
