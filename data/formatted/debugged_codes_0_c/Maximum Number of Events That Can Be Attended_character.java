Bug type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code starts with importing the `Arrays` class, which suggests that the class is being used in the code.
2. The code then defines a class named `Solution` without any syntax errors.
3. Within the `Solution` class, there is a method named `maxEvents` which takes in a 2D array of integers as a parameter and returns an integer.
4. The method first sorts the `events` array based on the last day of each event in ascending order.
5. Then, a `TreeSet` named `set` is declared to keep track of available days. The `TreeSet` is initialized in a for loop that runs from `1` to `100000` (inclusive), adding each value to the `set`.
6. An integer variable `ans` is declared and initialized to `0`. This variable will keep track of the maximum number of events that can be attended.
7. Another for loop is used to iterate through each event in the `events` array. 
8. Inside this loop, the code uses the `ceiling` method of the `set` to find the smallest element greater than or equal to the start day of the current event. It assigns this value to the `temp` variable, which is of type `Integer`.
9. The code then checks if `temp` is `null` or if it is greater than the end day of the current event. If either condition is true, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
10. Otherwise, it removes `temp` from the `set` and increments `ans` by `1`.
11. Finally, outside the for loop, the method returns `ans`, which is the maximum number of events that can be attended.

Fix:
The bug in the code is a syntax error in the first for loop of the `maxEvents` method. There is a missing semicolon (;) between `int i = 1` and `i <= 100000`. The correct syntax should be `for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++)`.

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.TreeSet;

class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[1] == b[1] ? a[0] - b[0] : a[1] - b[1]);

        TreeSet
