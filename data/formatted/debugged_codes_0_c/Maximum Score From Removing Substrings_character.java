Bug type: Syntax Error

Reasoning:
1. The code has a syntax error at line 18. The conditional statement is missing the parentheses around the condition.
2. The code is trying to compare the character 'c' with the character 'a' in the if condition. However, the equality check operator '==' is missing an equal sign.
3. The code has an extra semicolon at line 36.

To fix the bug:
1. Add parentheses around the condition in line 18.
2. Add an equal sign in the equality check operator at line 19.
3. Remove the extra semicolon at line 36.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumGain(String s, int x, int y) {

        int aCount = 0;
        int bCount = 0;
        int lesser = Math.min(x, y);
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c > 'b') {
                result += Math.min(aCount, bCount) * lesser;
                aCount = 0;
                bCount = 0;
            } else if (c == 'a') {
                if (x < y && bCount > 0) {
                    bCount--;
                    result += y;
                } else {
                    aCount++;
                }
            } else {
                if (x > y && aCount > 0) {
                    aCount--;
                    result += x;
                } else {
                    bCount++;
                }
            }
        }

        result += Math.min(aCount, bCount) * lesser;

        return result;
    }
}
```
The bug has been fixed by adding the parentheses around the condition, adding the equal sign in the equality check operator, and removing the extra semicolon.
