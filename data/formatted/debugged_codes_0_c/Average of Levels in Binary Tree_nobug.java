Bug Type: None

The provided Java code appears to be correct and does not contain any apparent bugs. 

The code uses a breadth-first search approach to traverse the binary tree level by level and calculate the average of values at each level. The code maintains a queue (q) to store the nodes of the current level, and in each iteration, it calculates the sum of values in that level (row) and the number of nodes in that level (qlen). It then calculates the average by dividing the row by qlen and adds it to the answer list. The code correctly handles adding the left and right child nodes to the queue for the next level.

No changes are needed to fix any bugs in the provided code.
