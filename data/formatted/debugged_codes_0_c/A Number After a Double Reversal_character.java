Upon reviewing the provided Java code, we can identify a potential bug in the logic of the equation.

The equation `num % 10 != 0 || num < 10` checks whether the last digit of the number is not zero or the number is less than 10. However, this logic does not account for numbers with multiple digits where the last digit is zero but other digits are not.

For example, if `num` is 30, the equation will return `false` because 30 % 10 = 0. However, in this case, we can reverse the digits and get 03, which is the same as 30.

To fix this bug and ensure that the code correctly identifies numbers that can be reversed to the same number, we need to modify the equation to consider cases where the last digit is zero but there are other non-zero digits.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameAfterReversals(int num) {
        String numString = String.valueOf(num);
        return (num % 10 != 0 || numString.length() == 1);
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we convert the `num` to a string using `String.valueOf(num)`. By doing this, we can check the length of the string to determine if the number has multiple digits or not. If the number has multiple digits, we return `true` regardless of the last digit being 0.
