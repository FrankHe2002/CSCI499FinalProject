Bug type: Arithmetic Bug

Reasoning: 

1. There is a subtraction operation happening inside a loop: `ans = (ans - k[1]) % mod;`
2. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 before the loop, and it is expected to store the sum of the subarray elements.
3. However, the subtraction operation can result in a negative value for `ans`, which is not expected.
4. Additionally, the modulo operation `mod` is not correctly applied after the subtraction. The modulo operation should be applied after each subtraction to ensure that the final value of `ans` is within the range of `mod`.

Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Change the subtraction operation to addition. This will ensure that negative values are not encountered.
2. Apply the modulo operation after each addition to keep the final value of `ans` within the range of `mod`.

Updated code: 

```java
class Solution {
    private static int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;

    public int rangeSum(int[] nums, int n, int left, int right) {

        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((n1, n2) -> n1[1] - n2[1]);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) pq.add(new int[] {i, nums[i]});

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= right; i++) {
            int[] k = pq.remove();
            if (i >= left) {
                ans = (ans + k[1]) % mod; // Fix: Changed subtraction to addition
            }
            if (k[0] + 1 < n) {
                pq.add(new int[] {k[0] + 1, k[1] + nums[k[0] + 1]});
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
