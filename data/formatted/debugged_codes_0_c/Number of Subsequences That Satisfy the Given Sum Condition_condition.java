The bug in the provided code is in the while loop condition. 

The correct condition to check if the sum of the elements at indices i and j is less than or equal to the target should be `(nums[i] + nums[j]) <= target`, not `(nums[i] + nums[j]) <= target` (the same condition as the first one).

To fix the bug, we need to change the second condition in the while loop to `(nums[i] + nums[j]) > target`:

```java
while (i <= j) {
    if ((nums[i] + nums[j]) <= target) {
        count = (count + pow[j - i]) % mod;
        i++;
    } else if ((nums[i] + nums[j]) > target)
        j--;
}
```

Explanation:
- The provided code sorts the given array `nums`.
- It then creates an array `pow` to store the powers of 2.
- The while loop checks if the sum of the elements at indices i and j is less than or equal to the target.
- If it is, it increments the count and moves the i pointer to the right.
- If it is not, it moves the j pointer to the left.
- The final count is returned as the result.

By fixing the bug in the while loop condition, the code should work correctly.
