The given Java code aims to count the number of operations required to make two integers equal by performing division and modulus operations.

Upon reviewing the code, I have identified a bug in the else block of the while loop. Specifically, there is a mistake in the line `num1 = num2 % num2;`. This line should be `num1 = num1 % num2;` to calculate the remainder of `num1` divided by `num2`.

To fix this bug, I will replace the line `num1 = num2 % num2;` with `num1 = num1 % num2;`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 40.8 MB (Top 69.19%)
class Solution {
    public int countOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int count = 0;
        while (num1 != 0 && num2 != 0) {
            if (num1 < num2) {
                count += num2 / num1;
                num2 = num2 % num1;
            } else {
                count += num1 / num2;
                num1 = num1 % num2;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

The bug is fixed, and the code should now correctly count the number of operations required to make `num1` and `num2` equal.
