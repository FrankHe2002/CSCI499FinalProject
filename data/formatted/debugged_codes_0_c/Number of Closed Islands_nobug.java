Bug Type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning:
- The code is trying to iterate over the cells in the grid.
- The loops start from 1 and end at m - 1 and n - 1, which suggests that only the interior cells are considered.
- However, the condition in the dfs() method checks if the current cell is on the boundary (i == 0, j == 0, i == grid.length - 1, j == grid[0].length - 1).
- If the current cell is on the boundary, it marks isClosed as false.
- There is a mismatch between the condition and the iteration range, which could lead to incorrect results.
- It is possible for a cell to be on the boundary but not be considered, if it is not included in the range of the loop.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 32.92%) | Memory: 47.1 MB (Top 43.92%)
class Solution {
    boolean isClosed = true;

    public int closedIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                isClosed = true;
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);

                    if (isClosed) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public void dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] != 0) return;

        grid[i][j] = 1; // to mark as visited

        if (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == grid.length - 1 || j == grid[0].length - 1) isClosed = false;

        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The fix involves changing the iteration range of the loops in the closedIsland() method.
- The loops should
