There doesn't appear to be any syntax errors in the provided Java code. However, there might be a logical bug in the code.

The code represents a solution to deleting a node with a given key from a binary search tree. Here's how the code works:

1. If the root node is null, i.e., the tree is empty, return null.
2. If the key is less than the value of the root node, recursively call the deleteNode function on the left subtree, and update the left child of the root with the result.
3. If the key is greater than the value of the root node, recursively call the deleteNode function on the right subtree, and update the right child of the root with the result.
4. If the key is equal to the value of the root node:
   - If the left child of the root is null, return the right child of the root.
   - If the right child of the root is null, return the left child of the root.
   - Otherwise, find the minimum node in the right subtree of the root by traversing left until there are no more left children.
   - Set the value of the root node to the value of the minimum node found in the previous step.
   - Recursively call the deleteNode function on the right subtree with the value of the minimum node, and update the right child of the root with the result.
   - Return the modified root.

Based on the provided code, it appears that the implementation is correct and there is no bug in terms of syntax or logic.

However, there is one minor issue that can be fixed. Inside the else block where the root node is equal to the key, the code can be simplified by handling the null cases first before finding the minimum node in the right subtree. This way, we can avoid the unnecessary traversal of the right subtree when the left subtree is null.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {
        if (root == null) return null;

        if (key < root.val) {
            root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
            return root;
        } else if (key > root.val) {
            root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
            return root;
        } else {
            if (root.left == null) {
                return root.right;
            } else if (root.right == null) {
                return root.left;
            } else {
                TreeNode
