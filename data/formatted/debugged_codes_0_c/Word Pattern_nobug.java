The bug in the code lies in the following condition:

```java
else if (! (map.containsKey(ch) || map.containsValue(arr[i]))) {
    map.put(ch, arr[i]);
}
```

This condition is checking if the character from the pattern does not exist as a key in the map or the word from the string does not exist as a value in the map. In this case, it tries to add the character and the word to the map as a key-value pair.

The problem arises when the character exists as a value in the map but not as a key. In this case, the condition `map.containsKey(ch)` will evaluate to false, and the condition `map.containsValue(arr[i])` will evaluate to true. Therefore, the else-if condition will be satisfied, and the character will not be added to the map.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to check if the character exists as a key or the word exists as a value in the map. We can do this by using the logical OR operator `||` instead of the logical AND operator `&&`.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean wordPattern(String pattern, String s) {
        String[] arr = s.split(" ");
        if (pattern.length() != arr.length) return false;
        Map<Character, String> map = new HashMap<Character, String>();

        for (int i = 0; i < pattern.length(); i++) {
            char ch = pattern.charAt(i);
            if (map.containsKey(ch)) {
                if (!map.get(ch).equals(arr[i])) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else if (!(map.containsKey(ch) || map.containsValue(arr[i]))) {
                map.put(ch, arr[i]);
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Now the code should correctly identify if the word pattern matches the given string.
