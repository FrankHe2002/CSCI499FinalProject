Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning process:

1. The code is using a TreeMap called `weightedRectIndex` to store cumulative weights as keys pointing to rectangle indices.
2. The cumulative weight is incremented by the product of the width and height of each rectangle.
3. The bug most likely lies in the calculation of the cumulative weight.
4. In the `width()` method, `rect[2] - rect[0] + 2` is used to calculate the width of each rectangle.
5. However, adding 2 to the width seems incorrect, as it should only be the difference between `rect[2]` and `rect[0]`.
6. Similarly, in the `height()` method, `rect[3] - rect[1] + 1` is used to calculate the height of each rectangle.
7. Adding 1 to the height also seems incorrect, as it should only be the difference between `rect[3]` and `rect[1]`.
8. Therefore, the bug is an off-by-one error in the `width()` and `height()` methods.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra additions of 2 and 1 in the `width()` and `height()` methods respectively.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    int[][] rects;
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> weightedRectIndex = new TreeMap<>();
    int nPoints = 0;

    Random rng = new Random();

    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        this.rects = rects;
        int index = 0;
        for (int[] rect : rects) {
            // inserts cumulative weight key pointing to rectangle index
            weightedRectIndex.put(nPoints, index++);
            nPoints += width(rect) * height(rect);
        }
    }

    public int[] pick() {
        // generates random point within total weight
        int point = rng.nextInt(nPoints);
        // finds appropriate rectangle
        var entry = weightedRectIndex.floorEntry(point);
        // find point within the current rectangle
        int rectPoint = point - entry.getKey();
        int[] rect = rects[entry.getValue()];
        return new int[] {
                rect[0] + rectPoint % width(rect),
                rect[1] + rectPoint / width(rect)};
    }

    private int width(int[] rect) {
        return rect[2] - rect[0];
    }

    private int height(int[] rect) {
        return rect[3] - rect[
