The bug in the provided code is in the sorting of the `ranges` array. The code is currently sorting the array based on the condition `o1[3] - o2[0]`, but there is no index `3` in the `ranges` array. This is causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to access `ranges[idx][0]` and `ranges[idx][1]` in the loop.

To fix this bug, we need to change the sorting condition to `o1[0] - o2[0]` to sort based on the starting value of the ranges.

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int countWays(int[][] ranges) {
        final long MOD = 1000000007;
        long ans = 1, size = ranges.length;

        if (size == 1) return 2;

        Arrays.sort(ranges, (int[] o1, int[] o2) -> o1[0] - o2[0]);

        int overlap = 0, notOverlap = 0;
        int tillMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int idx = 1; idx < size; idx++) {
            tillMax = Math.max(tillMax, ranges[idx - 1][1]);

            if (ranges[idx][0] <= ranges[idx - 1][1] || ranges[idx][0] <= tillMax) overlap++;
            else notOverlap++;
        }

        if (overlap > 0) ans *= 2;
        else notOverlap++;

        for (int idx = 1; idx <= notOverlap; idx++) {
            ans = ((ans * 2) % (long) MOD);
        }

        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```
