Bug type: Logic bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code seems to be calculating the maximum length of an increasing subsequence in the given array.
2. To do this, it uses a stack and dynamic programming.
3. The logic seems to be correct, where it checks if the current element is greater than the element at the top of the stack,
   and if true, it increases the length of the current subsequence by 1 compared to the previous subsequence stored in the dp array.
4. It then updates the dp array and the maximum length.
5. However, there is a bug where the current increment (cur) is reset to 0 in each iteration of the while loop.
   This means that if there are multiple elements greater than the current element, their increments are not considered correctly.
   The code should keep track of the maximum increment in each iteration.
   
Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the line `cur = Math.max(cur + 1, dp[stack.pop()]);` to
`cur = Math.max(cur + 1, dp[stack.pop()] + 1);`.
This ensures that the current increment takes into account the increment from the previous maximum subsequence length.

    public int totalSteps(int[] nums) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int ans = 0;
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int cur = 0;
            while (! stack.isEmpty() && nums[i] > nums[stack.peek()]) {
                cur = Math.max(cur + 1, dp[stack.pop()] + 1);
            }
            stack.push(i);
            dp[i] = cur;
            ans = Math.max(cur, ans);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
