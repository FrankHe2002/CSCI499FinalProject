Bug type: Array index out of bounds

Reasoning process:

1. The code initializes two arrays: `numRoadsConnectedCity` and `raadExist`.
2. `numRoadsConnectedCity` is an array that stores the number of roads connected to each city. The array size is set to `100 + 1`, which is unnecessary because the number of cities is given as `n`.
3. `raadExist` is a boolean 2D array that represents whether there is a road existing between two cities. The array size is set to `n x n`.
4. The code iterates over the `roads` array and updates the `numRoadsConnectedCity` and `raadExist` arrays accordingly.
5. After updating the arrays, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of cities.
6. In this nested loop, the code calculates the rank by summing up the number of roads connected to both cities.
7. Then, the code checks if there is a road between the two cities, and if so, decrements the rank.
8. Finally, the code updates `maxRank` if the current rank is higher.
9. The code returns `maxRank` as the result.

Identification and Fixing:

1. In the nested loop, the code tries to access `numRoadsConnectedCity[city4]`, which should be `numRoadsConnectedCity[city2]` instead.
2. Change `numRoadsConnectedCity[city4]` to `numRoadsConnectedCity[city2]`.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximalNetworkRank(int n, int[][] roads) {

        //number of road connected to city
        int[] numRoadsConnectedCity = new int[n];

        //road exists between two cities
        boolean[][] roadExist = new boolean[n][n];

        for (int[] cities : roads) {

            //increment the count of numbers of connected city
            numRoadsConnectedCity[cities[0]]++;
            numRoadsConnectedCity[cities[1]]++;

            //mark road exists between two cities
            roadExist[cities[0]][cities[1]] = true;
            roadExist[cities[1]][cities[0]] = true;
        }


        int maxRank = 0;
        for (int city1 = 0; city1 < n - 1; city1++) {
            for (int city2
