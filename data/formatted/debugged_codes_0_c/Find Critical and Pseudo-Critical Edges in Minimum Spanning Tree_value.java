Bug Type: Logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code tries to find critical and pseudo critical edges in a given graph.
2. It uses a Union-Find data structure to build the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and calculate its cost.
3. It then iterates over each edge in the graph and checks the MST cost with and without the current edge.
4. If the MST cost increases without the edge, it is considered a critical edge. If the MST cost remains the same, it is considered a pseudo critical edge.

Potential bug:
1. In the `buildMST` method, the code is constructing the MST and returning the cost. However, in the `if` condition where `edgePick` is not null, the code is trying to access `edgePick[4]`, which is out of bounds. It should be changed to `edgePick[2]` to access the weight of the edge.

Fix:
Replace `edgePick[4]` with `edgePick[2]` in the `buildMST` method:

```java
if (edgePick != null) {
    uf.union(edgePick[0], edgePick[1]);
    cost += edgePick[2];
}
```

This fix ensures that the weight of the selected edge is correctly added to the MST cost.
