Bug Type: Off-by-one error.

Reasoning:
1. The code starts with initializing `index` to 0.
2. It then iterates over the `nums` array, checking if `index` is equal to `nums[i]`.
3. If `index` is equal to `nums[i]`, it returns the index `i`.
4. If `index` is not equal to `nums[i]`, it increments `index` by 1 and checks if `index` has reached 10.
5. If `index` has reached 10, it resets `index` to 0.
6. Finally, if no equal element is found in the array, it returns -1.

The bug in the code is that it increments `index` before checking if it has reached 10. This means that the condition `if (++index == 10)` will be true when `index` is actually equal to 9, not 10. This results in prematurely resetting `index` to 0, causing incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition `if (++index == 10)` to `if (index == 9)`.

class Solution {
    public int smallestEqual(int[] nums) {
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (index == nums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            if (index == 9) {
                index = 0;
            } else {
                index++;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
