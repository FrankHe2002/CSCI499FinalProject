Based on the given Java code, the bug type appears to be a logical error.

In order to identify and fix the bug, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the code
The code appears to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the given array. It initially sorts the array in ascending order and then iterates through the numbers to find the GCD by decrementing a variable called "result".

Step 2: Identify the bug
The bug can be identified by analyzing the conditions inside the if statement within the while loop. It checks if "nums[0] % result == 0" and "n / result == 0" in order to break the loop.

The issue is with "n / result == 0" condition. It should check if "n % result == 0" instead of "n / result == 0". If the condition is checking for divisibility, it should use the modulus operator (%), not the division operator (/).

Step 3: Fix the bug
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition "n / result == 0" to "n % result == 0" inside the if statement.

Step 4: Apply the fix
Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findGCD(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums[nums.length - 1];
        int result = nums[0];
        while (result > 0) {
            if (nums[0] % result == 0 && n % result == 0) {
                break;
            }
            result--;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
