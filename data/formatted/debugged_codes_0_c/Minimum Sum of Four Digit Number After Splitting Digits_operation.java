Bug type: Logical bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code takes an integer `num` as input and calculates the sum of the smallest and largest possible two-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits of `num`.
2. The code uses an array `dig` to store the individual digits of `num`. The digits are stored in reverse order, i.e., the last digit of `num` is stored in the first element of the array.
3. The code then sorts the array `dig` in ascending order.
4. The code calculates `num1` as the sum of the last digit of the smallest digit (i.e., `dig[0]`) and the third digit (i.e., `dig[2]`).
5. The code calculates `num2` as the sum of the second digit (i.e., `dig[1]`) and the fourth digit (i.e., `dig[3]`).
6. The code returns the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

Potential bug:
If the number `num` has less than four digits, the calculation of `num2` might lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This is because `dig` has a length of 4, and accessing `dig[3]` when `num` has fewer than four digits would result in the exception.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we can check if `cur` exceeds the length of the `dig` array before accessing elements `dig[1]` and `dig[3]`. If it does, we can set the values of `num1` and `num2` to 0, as there are no digits available to calculate the sums.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumSum(int num) {
        int[] dig = new int[4]; // For each digit
        int cur = 0;
        while (num > 0 && cur < 4) // Getting each digit
        {
            dig[cur++] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        Arrays.sort(dig); // Ascending order
        int num1 = cur > 1 ? dig[0] % 10 + dig[2] : 0; // 1st and 3rd digit
        int num2 = cur > 3 ? dig[1] * 10 + dig[3] : 0; // 2nd and 4th digit
