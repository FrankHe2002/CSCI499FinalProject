The bug in the provided code is that the loop condition is incorrect. It should be `i < s.length() - 2` instead of `i < s.length()`. 

The reasoning process for identifying the bug is as follows:
1. The loop iterates from index 2 to the end of the string, checking for "good substrings".
2. A substring is considered "good" if all its characters are distinct.
3. The condition `s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 1) && s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 2) && s.charAt(i - 1) != s.charAt(i - 2)` checks that the current character, the previous character, and the character before that are all distinct.
4. However, when `i` reaches `s.length() - 1` and `i - 2` becomes `s.length() - 3`, it will throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` because there is no index `s.length()`.
5. Therefore, the loop condition should be changed to `i < s.length() - 2` to avoid this error.

Here is the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countGoodSubstrings(String s) {
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i < s.length() - 2; i++)
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 1) && s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 2) && s.charAt(i - 1) != s.charAt(i - 2))
                res++;
        return res;
    }
}
```
