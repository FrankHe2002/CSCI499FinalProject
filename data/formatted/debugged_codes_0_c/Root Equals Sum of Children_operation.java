There is a bug in the provided Java code. 

The bug is that the code assumes that the left and right children of the root node always exist when calculating the sum. However, this assumption may not hold true in all cases. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the left and right children of the root node exist before calculating the sum. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 77.34+) | Memory: 41.9 MB (Top 35.55%)
class Solution {
    public boolean checkTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root.left == null || root.right == null) {
            return false;
        }
        return root.val == root.left.val + root.right.val; // O(1)
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we added a check at the beginning of the method to verify if the left and right children of the root node exist. If either of them is null, we return false. Otherwise, we proceed with calculating the sum and returning the result.
