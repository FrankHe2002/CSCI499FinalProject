Bug type: Index out of bounds error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is designed to rotate each layer of the grid by k times.
2. The code iterates over each layer and stores the layer elements in an array called "layer".
3. Then, the code writes the rotated layer elements back to the grid.
4. The code uses loops to read and write the layer elements.
5. The loops are designed to iterate from `layerNo` to `n - layerNo` or `m - layerNo`.
6. The issue is that the second loop in the `readLayer` method and the first loop in the `writeLayer` method have incorrect loop conditions.
7. These loops iterate until `i < n - layerNo` or `i < m - layerNo`, respectively.
8. However, the correct condition should be `i <= n - layerNo` or `i <= m - layerNo`.
9. This error causes the loops to stop prematurely and miss the last element of each row/column.

Solution:
1. Update the loop conditions in the `readLayer` and `writeLayer` methods to `i <= n - layerNo` and `i <= m - layerNo`, respectively.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] rotateGrid(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length, noOfLayers = Math.min(m / 2, n / 2);
        // Peeling each layer one by one
        for (int layerNo = 0; layerNo < noOfLayers; layerNo++) {
            // Please suggest if you have better way to find perimeter of matrix on a given layer!
            int perimeter = (m - (2 * layerNo)) + (n - (2 * layerNo) - 1) + (m - (2 * layerNo) - 1) + (n - (2 * layerNo) - 2);
            int[] layer = new int[perimeter + 2]; // this out be use to store that particular layer
            readLayer(grid, layer, layerNo, m, n); // this will read the layer
            writeLayer(grid, layer, layerNo, m, n, k); // this will rotate it by k and write back the layer
        }
        return grid;
    }

    public void readLayer(int[][] grid, int[] layer, int layerNo, int m
