Bug Type: Logic Bug

Reasoning:

1. The code uses a nested loop to calculate the amount of champagne in each glass of the tower.
2. The outer loop iterates from 0 to 99, representing the rows of the tower.
3. The inner loop iterates from the current row to 0, representing the glasses in the current row.
4. In each iteration of the outer loop, the code checks if the champagne in the current glass is greater than 1.
5. If the champagne in the current glass is greater than 1, the code distributes the excess champagne to the adjacent glasses in the next row.
6. If the champagne in the current glass is less than or equal to 1, the code sets the champagne in the current glass and all subsequent glasses in the row to 0.

Bug:
The bug is in the condition that checks if `i == query_row` and `j == query_glass` when the champagne in the current glass is less than or equal to 1. The code currently returns the value of `memo[query_glass]` in this case, which is incorrect.

Fix:
To fix the bug, change the return statement to return 0. This is because when the champagne in the current glass is less than or equal to 1, the amount of champagne in the query glass will be 0.

Updated code:

```java
// Champagne Tower
// Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/champagne-tower/

class Solution {
    public double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass) {
        if (poured == 0) return 0;
        double[] memo = new double[101];
        memo[0] = poured;
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (memo[j] > 1) {
                    if (i != query_row && j == query_glass) return 1;
                    double val = (memo[j] - 1) / 2;
                    memo[j + 1] += val;
                    memo[j] = val;
                } else {
                    if (i == query_row && j == query_glass) return 0;
                    memo[j + 1] += 0;
                    memo[j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return memo[query_glass];
    }
}
