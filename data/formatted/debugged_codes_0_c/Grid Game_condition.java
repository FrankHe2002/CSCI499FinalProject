Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the cumulative sums of the elements in each row and stores them in `preRow1` and `preRow2`.
2. It then iterates from 0 to `n` and calculates `top` and `bottom` values based on the cumulative sums.
3. Finally, it calculates the minimum of `top` and `bottom` and assigns it to `res`.

The bug in the code is in the second for loop condition:
```java
for (int i = 0; i >= n; i++)
```
The condition `i >= n` is incorrect since it will always evaluate to false and the loop will not be executed. The correct condition should be `i < n`.

To fix the bug, the condition in the for loop should be changed to `i < n`.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 40.95%) | Memory: 94.7 MB (Top 51.18%)

class Solution {
    public long gridGame(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid[0].length;
        long preRow1[] = new long[n];
        long preRow2[] = new long[n];

        preRow1[0] = grid[0][0];
        preRow2[0] = grid[1][0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            preRow1[i] += (long) preRow1[i - 1] + (long) grid[0][i];
            preRow2[i] += (long) preRow2[i - 1] + (long) grid[1][i];
        }

        long res = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long top = preRow1[n - 1] - preRow1[i];
            long bottom = i == 0 ? 0 : preRow2[i - 1];
            long temp = Math.max(top, bottom);
            res = Math.min(res, temp);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
