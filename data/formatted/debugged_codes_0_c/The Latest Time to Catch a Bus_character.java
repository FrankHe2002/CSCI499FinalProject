Upon reviewing the code, I identified two potential bugs:

1. Missing semicolon: There is a missing semicolon on line 35, where we set the value of `x` to `buses[n - 1]`. This would result in a compilation error.

2. Logical error/missing condition: There is a logical error in the while loop starting on line 37. The loop condition checks `set.contains(x) == true`, but it should also check for `x > 0` to avoid an infinite loop.

To fix these bugs, we can add a semicolon on line 35 and modify the loop condition on line 37 to include `&& x > 0`.

Here's the corrected Java code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public int latestTimeCatchTheBus(int[] buses, int[] passengers, int capacity) {
        Arrays.sort(buses);
        Arrays.sort(passengers);
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int val : passengers) {
            set.add(val);
        }
        int n = buses.length;
        int m = passengers.length;
        int solb = capacity; // solb = space on last bus
        int lastPerson = 0;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < n && j < m) {
            int cc = capacity; // cc => current capacity;
            while (j < m && cc > 0 && buses[i] >= passengers[j]) {
                cc--;
                lastPerson = passengers[j];
                j++;
            }
            i++;
            solb = cc;
        }
        int x = lastPerson;
        if (solb > 0 || i != n) {
            x = buses[n - 1];
        }
        while (set.contains(x) && x > 0) {
            x--;
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```

By applying these minimal changes, both potential bugs have been addressed.
