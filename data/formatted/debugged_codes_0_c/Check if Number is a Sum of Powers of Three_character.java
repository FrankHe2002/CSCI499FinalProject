The identified bug in the provided code is a missing closing parenthesis in the for loop header. The correct code should be:

```java
for (int i = maxPower; i >= 0; i--) {
    //n is greater/equal to power 3
    if (n >= threePower[i]) {
        n -= threePower[i];
    }
}
```

The bug was identified by carefully reviewing the code and looking for any syntax errors or missing symbols. In this case, a missing closing parenthesis was found while checking the for loop header. This mistake can be fixed by simply adding the missing closing parenthesis.
