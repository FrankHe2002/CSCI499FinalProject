The code is trying to find the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots. The score of a pair of spots is calculated as the sum of their values minus the distance between them.

Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that there is a bug in the calculation of the answer (variable `ans`). The calculation should be `dp[i-1] + values[i] - (i-1)` instead of `dp[i-1] + values[i] + i`.

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScoreSightseeingPair(int[] values) {
        int n = values.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = values[0];
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], values[i] + i);
            ans = Math.max(ans, dp[i - 1] + values[i] - (i-1));
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Now the code should correctly calculate the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.
