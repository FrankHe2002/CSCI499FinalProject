To identify the bug and fix it, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the bug:
- The bug appears to be a typo in the method declaration. The method name "diagonalSumint" should be "diagonalSum" and there is a missing opening parenthesis "(" after it.

Step 2: Fix the bug:
- Correct the method declaration by changing "diagonalSumint" to "diagonalSum" and adding the missing opening parenthesis after it.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int diagonalSum(int[][] mat) {
        int sum1 = 0;
        int sum2 = 0;
        int n = mat.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum1 += mat[i][i];
            sum2 += mat[i][n - i - 1];
        }
        int res = sum1 + sum2;
        if (n % 2 != 0) {
            res -= mat[n / 2][n / 2];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by correcting the method declaration.
