The bug in the original code is that it does not handle the case where `k` is 0. The division operation `sum % k` will throw an exception when `k` is 0.

To fix this bug, we can use a different approach to solve the problem. 

The fixed code uses a HashMap to store the cumulative sum modulo `k` and its corresponding index. It iterates through the array and updates the cumulative sum. If the updated cumulative sum modulo `k` is already present in the HashMap and the index difference is at least 2, then we have found a subarray that sums to a multiple of `k` and return true. Otherwise, we update the HashMap with the cumulative sum modulo `k` and its current index.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> h = new HashMap<>();
        h.put(-1, - 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            sum = k == 0 ? sum : sum % k;
            if (h.containsKey(sum) && i - h.get(sum) >= 2) {
                return true;
            }
            h.put(sum, h.getOrDefault(sum, i));
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
