Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code checks if the sum of each row and each column in the matrix is equal to the expected sum (num).
2. It also checks if each row and each column contains unique numbers.
3. If any of these conditions are not met, the code returns false.
4. However, there is a logical error in the code. 

Bug:
The bug is in the if statement that checks the size of the hash sets hs and hs1. Specifically, the condition `hs.size() != n || hs.size() != n` is incorrect and will always be true because hs.size() cannot be both n and not equal to n at the same time.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the if statement to `hs.size() != n || hs1.size() != n`. This will correctly check if both hash sets have unique numbers.

Updated code:
```java
// Runtime: 56 ms (Top 50.77/) | Memory: 92.4 MB (Top 46.57%)
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValid(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int num = (n * (n + 1)) / 2; // SUM of n number 1 to n;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<Integer>();
            HashSet<Integer> hs1 = new HashSet<Integer>();

            int m = num;
            int k = num;

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                hs.add(matrix[i][j]);
                hs1.add(matrix[j][i]);
                m -= matrix[i][j];
                k -= matrix[j][i];
            }

            if (m != 0 || k != 0 || hs.size() != n || hs1.size() != n) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
