The given Java code seems to have a bug. 

Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning Process:

1. The `dfs` method is called recursively with `toppingIndex+1` as the argument.
2. In the recursive calls, the `dfs` method is called with `toppingIndex + 2` as the argument and also with `toppingIndex` as the argument.
3. These two recursive calls with `toppingIndex + 2` and `toppingIndex` can cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if `toppingIndex` is already at the last index of the `toppingCosts` array.

To fix the bug, we need to change the recursive calls to check if the `toppingIndex + 2` is within the bounds of the `toppingCosts` array before making the recursive call.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int closestCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int closestCostDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    public int closestCost(int[] baseCosts, int[] toppingCosts, int target) {
        for (int base : baseCosts) {
            dfs(toppingCosts, 0, base, target);
        }
        return closestCost;
    }

    public void dfs(int[] toppingCosts, int toppingIndex, int cost, int target) {
        int costDiff = Math.abs(target - cost);

        if (costDiff < closestCostDiff || (costDiff == closestCostDiff && cost < closestCost)) {
            closestCostDiff = costDiff;
            closestCost = cost;
        }

        if (toppingIndex >= toppingCosts.length || cost > target) {
            return;
        }

        if (toppingIndex + 1 < toppingCosts.length) {
            dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost, target);
            dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost + toppingCosts[toppingIndex + 1], target);
            dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost + 2 * toppingCosts[toppingIndex + 1], target);
        }
    }
}
```
