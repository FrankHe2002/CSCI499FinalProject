The code appears to have a bug. The bug is in the condition used to check if the input matrix can be reshaped to the desired dimensions (r x c).

The condition `r + c != mat.length * mat[0].length` checks if the total number of elements in the desired reshaped matrix (r x c) is not equal to the total number of elements in the input matrix (mat.length * mat[0].length). If this condition is true, the method returns the input matrix without any reshaping.

However, this condition is incorrect. The total number of elements in the desired reshaped matrix should be equal to the total number of elements in the input matrix for a valid reshape. So, the correct condition should be `r * c != mat.length * mat[0].length`.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition in line 6 of the code. Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 90.50%) | Memory: 50.7 MB (Top 48.08%)
class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] mat, int r, int c) {

        if (r * c != mat.length * mat[0].length) {
            return mat;
        }

        int[][] ans = new int[r][c];

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        for (int k = 0; k < mat.length; k++) {
            for (int l = 0; l < mat[0].length; l++) {
                if (j == c) {
                    i++;
                    j = 0;
                }
                ans[i][j++] = mat[k][l];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
