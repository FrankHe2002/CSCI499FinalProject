There are a few issues with this code that need to be fixed:

1. The code imports `java.util.TreeMap` and `java.util.NavigableMap`, but these classes are not used in the code. Therefore, these two imports can be removed.

2. The variable `max` is initialized as 0, but it should be initialized as `-1` to account for the fact that the `return` statement at the end of the code adds `1` to `max`. 

3. The `isPossibleToRemove()` method checks if the size of `frequenciesMap` is equal to 1, and if so, checks if the value of the first entry is equal to 1. This logic is incorrect. It should actually check if the key of the first entry is equal to 1, since the key represents the frequency. Similarly, the code should check if the value of the first entry is equal to 1 when the size of `frequenciesMap` is equal to 2. The conditions in the `if` statement should be switched.

4. The `removeElement()` method should return `frequencyValue.getKey() - 1` when the value of `frequencyValue` is greater than 1, and `frequencyValue.getKey()` when the value is equal to 1. The current implementation is the opposite.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int maxEqualFreq(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> F = new HashMap<>(); //Frequencies
        int[] V = new int[nums.length + 1]; //Values for frequencies
        int max = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            increaseCount(F, nums[i]);
            int frequency = F.get(nums[i]);
            decreaseCount(V, frequency - 1);
            increaseCount(V, frequency);
            if (isPossibleToRemove(V)) max = i;
        }
        return max + 1;
    }

    public boolean isPossibleToRemove(int[] frequencies) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < frequencies.length; i++) {
            if (frequencies[i] != 0) {
                count++;
                if (count > 2) return false; // More than 2 different frequencies
            }
        }

        if (count == 1) {
            return frequencies[1] ==
