The bug in the provided code is a typo in the line:
```
sum += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[1] - timeSeries[i - 1]);
```
The index should be `i` instead of `1`, so the correct line of code should be:
```
sum += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i - 1]);
```

To identify the bug, we can follow these steps:
1. Understand the expected behavior: The goal of the code is to calculate the total time duration that a person is being poisoned, given an array of time series when the person is attacked, and the duration of the poisoning effect.
2. Review the code: The code loops through the time series array, and for each time point, it calculates the duration of the poisoning effect and adds it to the total sum. The calculation is done correctly in the first iteration (when `i == 0`), but it is incorrect in subsequent iterations.
3. Identify the bug: The bug is in the line `sum += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[1] - timeSeries[i - 1]);`. The index should be `i` instead of `1`. This means that in each iteration, the code is calculating the duration using the same two time points (the first and the previous one in the array), instead of using the current and previous time points.
4. Apply the fix: Change the code to `sum += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i - 1]);` to correctly calculate the duration using the current and previous time points.
5. Test the fixed code: To verify that the fix is correct, we can test the code with different inputs, including edge cases like empty time series, time series with only one attack, and time series with multiple attacks. We can compare the output of the fixed code with the expected results to ensure the correctness of the fix.

Here's the code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < timeSeries.length; i++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                sum += duration;
            } else {
                sum += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i - 1]);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
