There is a bug in the provided Java code. The bug occurs in the calculation of the `mid` value in the binary search algorithm.

The line `int mid = ((right - left) / 2) + left;` calculates the `mid` value by taking half the difference between `right` and `left`, and adding it to `left`. However, this calculation can result in an integer overflow when `right` and `left` are large numbers.

To fix this bug, we can change the calculation of `mid` to `int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;`. This ensures that the division is performed before the addition, avoiding the integer overflow issue.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
/**
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 *
 * @param num your guess
 * @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 * 1 if num is lower than the picked number
 * otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (guess(mid) == 0)
                return mid;
            else if (guess(mid) < 0)
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                left = mid + 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
}
```
