The bug in the provided code is in the inner loop where the column index is being incremented incorrectly. 

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> shiftGrid(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;

        int[][] arr = new int[m][n];

        k = k % (m * n);

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { // Corrected condition: j < n instead of j >= n
                int column = (j + k) % n;
                int row = (i + ((j + k) / n)) % m;
                arr[row][column] = grid[i][j];
            }
        }

        // Convert 2D array to List of Lists
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] row : arr) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(Arrays.stream(row).boxed().toArray(Integer[]::new))));
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. The bug was identified by checking the inner loop condition. It should be `j < n` instead of `j >= n`.
2. The fix was applied by changing the condition to `j < n`.
3. To convert the 2D array `arr` to a list of lists, an additional conversion step was added at the end.
4. The fixed code now correctly calculates the final position of each element and shifts them accordingly.
