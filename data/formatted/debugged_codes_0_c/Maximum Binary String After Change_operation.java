Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
1. The code iterates over the characters in the binary string and checks if the first zero has been found.
2. If the first zero has not been found, it appends '1' to the answer string.
3. If the first zero has been found, it checks if the current character is '0' or '1'.
4. If the current character is '0', it appends '1' to the answer string.
5. If the current character is '1', it appends '1' to a buffer string.
6. The final answer is obtained by appending the buffer to the answer string.
7. The answer string is returned.

Bug:
The logic is incorrectly appending '1' to the answer string when the first zero has been found and the current character is '0'. This causes incorrect output.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in line 16 to append '0' instead of '1' when the first zero has been found.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String maximumBinaryString(String binary) {
        int n = binary.length();
        StringBuffer ans = new StringBuffer();
        StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();
        int onesAfter1stZero = 0;
        boolean found1stZero = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (found1stZero) {
                if (binary.charAt(i) == '0')
                    ans.append('0');
                else
                    buffer.append('1');
            } else {
                if (binary.charAt(i) == '0') {
                    found1stZero = true;
                    buffer.append('0');
                } else
                    ans.append('1');
            }
        }

        ans.append(buffer);
        return ans.toString();
    }
}
```
