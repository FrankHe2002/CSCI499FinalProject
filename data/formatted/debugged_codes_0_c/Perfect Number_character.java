The bug in the provided code is in the for loop condition. The condition `i < Math.sqrt(num)` should be changed to `i <= Math.sqrt(num)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 51.95%) | Memory: 40.9 MB (Top 44.38%)
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPerfectNumber(int num) {
        if (num == 1)
            return false;

        int sum = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                sum += i + num / i;
            }
        }
        if (sum == num) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The initial condition `if (num == 1)` checks if the input number `num` is equal to 1. If it is, then the function should return false as 1 is not a perfect number.
- The variable `sum` is initialized with the value 1 since every number is divisible by 1.
- The for loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `i <= Math.sqrt(num)`. This loop iterates over all potential divisors of `num`.
- Inside the loop, if `num` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `num % i == 0`), then we add `i` and `num / i` to the `sum`. This considers both factors of the division to calculate the sum of all divisors.
- After the loop, if the `sum` is equal to `num`, then it means `num` is a perfect number and we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

The bug was identified by recognizing that the loop condition was incorrect. Since the square root of `num` could be a valid divisor, the condition should be `i <= Math.sqrt(num)` instead of `i < Math.sqrt(num)`. This ensures that the loop includes the square root itself in the iteration.
