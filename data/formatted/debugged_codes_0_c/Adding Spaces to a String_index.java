Based on the given code, the bug occurs in the conditional statement `if (j < spaces.length && spaces[j + 1] == curr)`. 

Here's the reasoning process step-by-step:

1. The loop iterates until `curr` is less than the length of the input string `s`.
2. The condition `j < spaces.length` checks if the index `j` is within the bounds of the `spaces` array.
3. Next, the condition `spaces[j + 1] == curr` checks if the next element in the `spaces` array is equal to the value of `curr`, which is used to determine if a space should be added before the current character.
4. However, there are two issues with this logic:
   - First, the condition should be `spaces[j] == curr` instead of `spaces[j + 1] == curr`. This is because the `j` variable is incremented inside the loop, so it should directly index the `spaces` array.
   - Second, the condition should be `j < spaces.length - 1` instead of `j < spaces.length`. This is to prevent an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when accessing `spaces[j + 1]` if `j` is already at the last index of the `spaces` array.
5. Additionally, the space character should be added after appending the current character, not before.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String addSpaces(String s, int[] spaces) {
        int j = 0, curr = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        while (curr < s.length()) {
            sb.append(s.charAt(curr));
            if (j < spaces.length - 1 && spaces[j] == curr) {
                sb.append(" ");
                j++;
            }
            curr++;
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
