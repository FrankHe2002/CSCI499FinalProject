The bug in the code is with the calculation of the trailing zeros. It is incorrectly counting the number of factors of 2, instead of counting the number of factors of 5.

To identify this bug, let's consider the example of n = 10. According to the code, the count would be incremented by 10/2 = 5 in the first iteration, resulting in a count of 5. However, the correct answer is 2, as there are only 2 trailing zeros in the factorial of 10 (10! = 3628800).

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to count the number of factors of 5 instead of factors of 2.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n >= 5) {
            count += n / 5;
            n = n / 5;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

In this code, we check if n is greater than or equal to 5 in the while loop condition. Then, we increment the count by n/5 (which represents the number of factors of 5 in n!). Finally, we update n to n/5, as we are moving towards smaller numbers in each iteration.

This fix ensures that the code correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of n.
