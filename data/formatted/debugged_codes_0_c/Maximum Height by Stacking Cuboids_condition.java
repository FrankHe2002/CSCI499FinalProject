Bug type: Array index out of bounds error.

Reasoning process:
1. The code sorts the `cuboids` array in ascending order for each array within it.
2. The code then sorts the `cuboids` array based on height, breadth, and length, in that order.
3. The code then calls the `helperTab` method and passes the sorted `cuboids` array to it.
4. The `helperTab` method initializes arrays `currRow` and `nextRow` with size `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.
5. A nested loop is used to iterate through each element in `nums` and update the `currRow` array accordingly.
6. The inner loop starts from `curr - 1` and ends at `-1`.
7. The inner loop calculates the `take` and `notTake` values based on the current and previous elements in `nums`.
8. The `currRow[prev + 1]` is updated with the maximum of `take` and `notTake`.
9. The `nextRow` array is assigned the value of `currRow` at the end of each iteration.
10. Finally, the method returns the value at index 0 in the `nextRow` array.

To identify the bug, we need to analyze the loop conditions and array sizes:

1. The outer loop in `helperTab` starts from `n - 1` and ends at 0, inclusive.
2. The inner loop in `helperTab` starts from `curr - 1` and ends at -1, inclusive.
3. The `currRow` and `nextRow` arrays have a size of `n + 1`.

Based on the above analysis, we can identify a potential bug in the array index access in the inner loop.

To fix the bug, we should change the inner loop condition to `prev >= 0` instead of `prev >= -1`. This will ensure that we only access valid indices of `nums`.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
// Runtime: 9 ms (Top 37.8%) | Memory: 41.26 MB (Top 83.6%)

class Solution {
    public int maxHeight(int[][] cuboids) {
        // Sorting all Dimensions
        for (int[] arr : cuboids) Arrays.sort(arr);

        // sort all cuboids on basis of height, if same then breadth,
