The code appears to be a solution to a sorting problem on leetcode. However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that the sorting logic is incorrect.

The bug in the code is in the line:
```java
res[st.charAt(st.length() - 1) - '1'] = st.substring(0, st.length() - 1);
```

The intention of this line is to sort the strings based on the last character. However, the current logic subtracts the integer value of '1' from the ASCII value of the last character. This would result in incorrect indices for the `res` array, causing ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

To fix this bug, we need to subtract the integer value of '1' from the last character, not the ASCII value. We also need to convert the resulting integer to a string before using it as an index. 

Here is the revised code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public String sortSentence(String s) {
        String[] res = new String[s.split(" ").length];
        for (String st : s.split(" ")) {
            int index = st.charAt(st.length() - 1) - '1';
            res[index] = st.substring(0, st.length() - 1);
        }
        return String.join(" ", res);
    }
}
```

By making these minimal changes, we have fixed the bug in the code.
