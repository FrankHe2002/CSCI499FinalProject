The bug in the provided code is a logic error in the for loop. 

Here is the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The code uses a stack to store the numbers.
2. The input array `nums` is sorted in ascending order using `Arrays.sort(nums)`.
3. The for loop iterates over the sorted array.
4. Inside the for loop, each number is pushed onto the stack.
5. The code then checks if `i < nums.length - 1`, which means it is not the last number in the array. If it is not the last number, it compares the current number with the next number using `nums[++i] != (int) numStack.peek()`.
6. If the current number is not equal to the next number, the loop is terminated using `break`.
7. Finally, the last number pushed onto the stack is returned using `return (int) numStack.pop()`.

The bug in the code is that the for loop skips the current number if it is not equal to the next number. This is incorrect because in the case when there is only one unique number in the array, the loop will terminate prematurely and return the wrong result.

To fix this bug, we can remove the line `if (i < nums.length - 1 && nums[++i] != (int) numStack.peek()) break;`. This will allow all the numbers to be pushed onto the stack, and then we can simply return the top element of the stack using `return (int) numStack.peek()`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        Stack<Integer> numStack = new Stack<>();
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            numStack.push(nums[i]);
        }
        return numStack.peek();
    }
}
```
