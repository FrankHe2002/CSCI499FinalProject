Bug type: Infinite loop

Explanation and Fix:

1. The bug type in the provided code is an infinite loop.
2. The condition in the `while` loop is `left == right`, which means the loop will only execute if `left` and `right` are equal.
3. However, inside the loop, both `left` and `right` are being right-shifted with `>>= 1`, which means they are being divided by 2.
4. Due to the division, `left` and `right` will eventually become different, which will break the condition of the `while` loop.
5. To fix this bug, we need to change the loop condition to `left <= right`, so that the loop will continue until `left` becomes greater than `right`.
6. One more thing to note is that the `right <<= count` statement is not needed because `right` already represents the bitwise AND of the range between `left` and `right`.
7. Therefore, the fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            count++;
        }
        return right;
    }
}
```
