There is a minor syntax error in the provided Java code. 

The line `int[ countN = count(n);` should be modified to `int[] countN = count(n);` to properly declare the `countN` variable as an array.

To identify and fix the bug, we need to analyze the code and understand its purpose.

1. The `reorderedPowerOf2` method accepts an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value.
2. The method counts the number of occurrences of each digit in `n` using the `count` method.
3. It then initializes `num` as 1 and enters a loop that runs 31 times.
4. In each iteration, the method checks if the count of digits in `num` is equal to the count of digits in `n` using the `Arrays.equals` method.
5. If the counts are equal, it returns true.
6. Otherwise, it left-shifts `num` by 1 (multiplying it by 2) for the next iteration.
7. After the loop finishes, it means that no power of 2 with the same digit count as `n` was found, so it returns false.

To fix the bug, we only need to correct the syntax error by changing `int[ countN = count(n);` to `int[] countN = count(n);`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public boolean reorderedPowerOf2(int n) {
        int[] countN = count(n);
        int num = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++) {
            if (Arrays.equals(countN, count(num))) {
                return true;
            }
            num = num << 1;
        }
        return false;
    }

    int[] count(int n) {
        int[] arr = new int[10];
        while (n > 0) {
            arr[n % 10]++;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```
