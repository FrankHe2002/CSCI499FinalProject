The code appears to have a bug related to the count calculation. 
Here is the bug in the current code:

1. In the loop to calculate the count, the logic is incorrect. It is checking if the value of the key in the HashMap is 0 and then adding the absolute value of it to the count. However, the value of the key can be positive or negative, so checking if it is 0 is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the for loop to check if the value of the key is greater than 0. If it is, then add it to the count.

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> hmap = new HashMap<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray())
            hmap.put(ch, hmap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        for (char ch : t.toCharArray())
            hmap.put(ch, hmap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) - 1);
        int count = 0;
        for (char key : hmap.keySet())
            if (hmap.get(key) > 0) // fixed bug in the condition
                count += hmap.get(key); // directly add the value, no need for absolute value
        return count;
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that only the characters that have more occurrences in `s` than in `t` are counted by checking if the value of the key is greater than 0. Additionally, we can directly add the value of the key to the count, no need for the absolute value.
