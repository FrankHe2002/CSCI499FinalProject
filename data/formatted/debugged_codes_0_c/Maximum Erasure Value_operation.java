Bug type: logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code uses an array `nmap` to keep track of the frequency of each number in the `nums` array.
2. It also keeps track of the total sum of a subarray using the `total` variable.
3. The code iterates through the `nums` array using two pointers (`left` and `right`).
4. For each element, it increments its frequency in `nmap`, adds it to `total`, and then checks if its frequency is greater than 1.
5. If the frequency is greater than 1, it decrements the frequency in `nmap`, subtracts the element from `total`, and increments `left` to exclude that element from the subarray.
6. After each iteration, it updates `best` with the maximum of `best` and `total`.
7. Finally, it returns the value of `best` which represents the maximum sum of a subarray with distinct elements.

Based on the reasoning process, I don't see any obvious syntactical errors or any incorrect operations. However, I can see that the code could be improved by making the `nmap` array larger to accommodate a greater range of numbers. Currently, it can only handle numbers up to 10000. For larger numbers, the code may throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The bug fix would be to increase the size of the `nmap` array to the maximum possible number in the `nums` array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumUniqueSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int[] nmap = new int[100001];
        int total = 0, best = 0;
        for (int left = 0, right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            nmap[nums[right]]++;
            total += nums[right];
            while (nmap[nums[right]] > 1) {
                nmap[nums[left]]--;
                total -= nums[left++];
            }
            best = Math.max(best, total);
        }
        return best;
    }
}
```

In the fix, I changed `short[] nmap = new short[10001];` to `int[] nmap = new int[100001];` to allow for a larger range of numbers.
