Bug Type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning:
1. The code has a for loop that iterates from 0 to `a.length` (inclusive).
2. Inside the loop, the code generates a random index `ren` and swaps the elements at indices `i` and `ren`.
3. The problem is that the loop condition `i <= a.length` is incorrect. It should be `i < a.length`.
4. With the current condition, the loop runs one extra time, which causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing `a[i]` inside the loop. This is because the index `i` becomes `a.length` in the last iteration.

Fix:
Change the loop condition from `i <= a.length` to `i < a.length`.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {

    int a[];
    int b[];

    public Solution(int[] nums) {
        a = nums.clone();
        b = nums.clone();
    }

    public int[] reset() {
        a = b.clone();
        return a;
    }

    public int[] shuffle() {
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            int ren = (int) (Math.random() * a.length);
            int temp = a[ren];
            a[ren] = a[i];
            a[i] = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
