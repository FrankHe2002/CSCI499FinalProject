Potential Bug: The bug in the provided code is that the line `s = s.replaceFirst(part, "");` is being used inside a while loop. This can lead to an infinite loop if the `part` string is not properly removed from `s`.

Fixing the Bug:

1. First, we need to understand the purpose of the code. It is supposed to remove all occurrences of the `part` string from `s`.

2. Instead of using `s.replaceFirst(part, "")`, we can use `s.replace(part, "")`. This will remove all occurrences of `part` from `s`.

3. Additionally, we can change the while loop condition from `s.contains(part)` to `s.contains(part) && !part.isEmpty()`, to handle the case where `part` is an empty string. This prevents an infinite loop if `part` is empty.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        while (s.contains(part) && !part.isEmpty()) {
            s = s.replace(part, "");
        }
        return s;
    }
}
```
