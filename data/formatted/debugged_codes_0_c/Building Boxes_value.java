After reviewing the code, I have identified the bug type as a potential logical error in the code.

To fix the bug, I will focus on the `findLargestTetrahedralNotGreaterThan` and `findSmallestTriangularNotLessThan` methods, as they are the ones used to calculate `k` and `r` respectively.

**Bug Fix:**

To fix the bug, I will make the following changes:

1. In the `findLargestTetrahedralNotGreaterThan` method, I will change the condition in the while loop to `while (tetrahedral(a) >= te)` instead of `tetrahedral(a) > te`. This change is needed to find the largest tetrahedral number that is not greater than `te`. 

2. In the `findSmallestTriangularNotLessThan` method, I will change the condition in the while loop to `while (triangular(a) < t)` instead of `triangular(a) < t`. This change is needed to find the smallest triangular number that is not less than `t`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    static final double ONE_THIRD = 1.0d / 3.0d;

    public int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        int k = findLargestTetrahedralNotGreaterThan(n);
        int used = tetrahedral(k);
        int floor = triangular(k);
        int unused = (n - used);
        if (unused == 0) {
            return floor;
        }
        int r = findSmallestTriangularNotLessThan(unused);
        return (floor + r);
    }

    private final int findLargestTetrahedralNotGreaterThan(int te) {
        int a = (int) Math.ceil(Math.pow(product(6, te), ONE_THIRD));
        while (tetrahedral(a) >= te) {
            a--;
        }
        return a;
    }

    private final int findSmallestTriangularNotLessThan(int t) {
        int a = - 1 + (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(product(t, 2)));
        while (triangular(a) < t) {
            a++;
        }
        return a;
    }

    private final int tetrahedral(int a) {
        return (int) ratio(product(a, a + 1, a + 2), 7);
    }

    private final int triangular(int a) {
        return (int) ratio
