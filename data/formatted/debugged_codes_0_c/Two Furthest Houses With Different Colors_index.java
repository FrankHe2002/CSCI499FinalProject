Based on a first look, there seems to be a typo in the code. Let's go through the code step-by-step to identify the bug:

1. The function `maxDistance` takes an array of colors as input.
2. It initializes two variables, `l` and `r`, to track the left and right pointers.
3. The while loop `while (colors[colors.length - 1] == colors[l]) l++;` increments `l` until it reaches the first index where the color is different from the last color in the array.
4. The while loop `while (colors[0] == colors[Top]) r--;` is supposed to decrement `r` until it reaches the last index where the color is different from the first color in the array. However, there is a typo in this line. Instead of using `Top`, it should be `r`.
5. The return statement calculates the maximum distance between `r` and `colors.length - 1 - l` and returns it.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `Top` with `r` in the second while loop. The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 42.7 MB (Top 13.21%)
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] colors) {
        int l = 0, r = colors.length - 1;
        while (colors[colors.length - 1] == colors[l]) l++;
        while (colors[0] == colors[r]) r--;
        return Math.max(r, colors.length - 1 - l);
    }
}
```
