Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process:
1. The code calculates the maximum and minimum number of moves to move the stones in the pile.
2. The `findMaximum()` method finds the maximum number of moves by recursively checking if the stones are already in consecutive positions. If they are not, it adjusts the positions of the stones to try and make them consecutive.
3. The `findMinimum()` method checks if the stones are already in consecutive positions. If not, it returns either 1 or 2 depending on the distance between the stones.
4. The bug lies in the `findMinimum()` method. It incorrectly calculates the minimum number of moves by checking the absolute difference between the positions of the stones. It should be checking the number of stones between them, not the absolute difference between their positions.

Fix:
1. In the `findMinimum()` method, replace the condition `Math.abs(arr[0] - arr[1]) > 2 && Math.abs(arr[1] - arr[2]) > 2` with `arr[2] - arr[0] > 2`.
2. This compares the number of stones between the positions of the stones with 2, which correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required.

Updated code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] numMovesStones(int a, int b, int c) {
        int[] arr = {a, b, c};
        int[] arr2 = {a, b, c};
        int maximum = findMaximum(arr);
        int minimum = findMinimum(maximum, arr2);
        return new int[] {minimum, maximum};
    }

    public int findMaximum(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int count = 0;
        if (arr[0] == (arr[1] - 1) && arr[1] == (arr[2] - 1)) return count;
        if (arr[0] == arr[1] - 1) {
            arr[2]--;
            count++;
        } else {
            arr[0]++;
            count++;
        }
        return count + findMaximum(arr);

    }

    public int findMinimum(int max, int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        if (max == 0) return 0;
        else if (arr[2] - arr[0] > 2) return 2;
        else return 1;
    }
}
