Bug type: Infinite Loop

Reasoning process:
1. The code is using a queue to perform a level order traversal of a binary tree.
2. The outer while loop runs as long as the queue is not empty.
3. Inside the while loop, a for loop is used to iterate through all the nodes at the current level.
4. However, there is a bug in the for loop condition. The condition `i >= size` should be `i < size` in order to iterate `size` number of times.
5. Since the condition `i >= size` is always false, the for loop never executes and the size of the queue never decreases, resulting in an infinite loop.

Fix:
Change the condition `i >= size` to `i < size` in the for loop.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    // rest of the code
}
```
