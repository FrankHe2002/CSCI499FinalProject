Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the initialization of the `minX` and `minY` arrays. The size of these arrays is determined by the length of the matrix rows (`m`) and the length of the matrix columns (`n`), respectively. However, the code assumes that the matrix has at least one row and one column, without performing any checks. This assumption can lead to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the matrix is empty.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the matrix is not empty before initializing the `minX` and `minY` arrays. If the matrix is empty, we can simply return an empty array as the answer.

Additionally, to optimize the code and avoid unnecessary computation and memory usage, we can move the initialization of the `minX` and `minY` arrays inside the loop that iterates over the different values in the matrix. This way, we only initialize the arrays for the specific values that are being processed, rather than initializing them for all values in the matrix.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 209 ms (Top 84.06%) | Memory: 75.6 MB (Top 97.21%)
class Solution {
    int[] parent;

    public int[][] matrixRankTransform(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] answer = new int[m][n];

        if (m == 0 || n == 0) {
            return answer;
        }

        // GROUP BY MATRIX VAL -> {X,Y}
        TreeMap<Integer, List<int[]>> map = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int[] xy = {i, j};
                int val = matrix[i][j];
                if (map.get(val) == null)
                    map.put(val, new ArrayList<>());
                map.get(val).add(xy);
            }
        }

        for (Integer key : map.keySet()) {
            List<int[]> list = map.get(key);

            int lSize = list.size();
            parent = new int[lSize];
            for (int i = 0; i < lSize; i++)
                parent[i] = i;

            int[] minX = new int[m];
            int[] minY = new int[n];

            // Group the xy
