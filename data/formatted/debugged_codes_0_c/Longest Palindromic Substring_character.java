The bug in the provided Java code is a missing semicolon in the line `r++` within the `checkPalindrome` method. The code is currently missing the semicolon at the end of the line, causing a syntax error.

To identify the bug, we need to carefully analyze the code line by line:

1. The `Solution` class is defined with a `max` variable of type `String`. This variable is used to store the longest palindrome found in the `longestPalindrome` method.
2. The `checkPalindrome` method is a helper method that checks if a substring of `s` is a palindrome. It takes three parameters: the input string `s`, the left index `l`, and the right index `r` of the substring to check.
3. Inside the `checkPalindrome` method, there is a `while` loop that iterates while `l` is greater than or equal to 0, `r` is less than the length of `s`, and the characters at indices `l` and `r` are equal.
4. Within the loop, there is an `if` statement that checks if the current palindrome found (from index `l` to index `r`) is longer than the current maximum palindrome (`max`). If it is, the `max` variable is updated to the new palindrome found.
5. Finally, the `l` and `r` variables are incremented and decremented, respectively, to expand the palindrome search range.

To fix the code, we simply need to add a semicolon at the end of the line `r++`:

```java
class Solution {
    String max = "";

    private void checkPalindrome(String s, int l, int r) {
        while (l >= 0 && r < s.length() && s.charAt(l) == s.charAt(r)) {
            if (r - l >= max.length()) {
                max = s.substring(l, r + 1);
            }

            l--;
            r++; // added semicolon
        }
    }

    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            checkPalindrome(s, i, i);
            checkPalindrome(s, i, i + 1);
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code will compile and execute without any syntax errors.
