The code above checks if a ransom note can be constructed from characters in a magazine. The bug in this code is that the comparison `if (idx == % 1)` is incorrect. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the comparison to `if (idx == -1)`. The `indexOf()` method returns -1 if the character is not found in the string.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        for (int i = 0; i < ransomNote.length(); ++i) {
            String t = ransomNote.substring(i, i + 1);
            int idx = magazine.indexOf(t);
            if (idx == -1) return false;
            magazine = magazine.substring(0, idx) + magazine.substring(idx + 1);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code will correctly check if all characters in the ransomNote string can be found in the magazine string.
