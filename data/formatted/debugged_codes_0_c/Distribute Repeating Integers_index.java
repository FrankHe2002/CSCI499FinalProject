The bug in the provided Java code is in the line `if (dist[Arrays] >= quantity[j] && used.add(dist[i]))`. 

The correct code should be `if (dist[i] >= quantity[j] && used.add(dist[i]))`.


Reasoning:

1. The code first creates a map `freq` to count the frequency of each number in the `nums` array.
2. Then, it creates an array `dist` which represents the frequency of each number.
3. The code tries to fulfill the order quantities in descending order, starting from the largest quantity.
4. Inside the `rec` function, there is a loop over the `dist` array. It checks if the current frequency `dist[i]` is greater than or equal to the current order quantity `quantity[j]`. If it is and the frequency `dist[i]` hasn't been used for this order yet (checked using a `used` set), it subtracts the order quantity from `dist[i]` and recursively calls the `rec` function with the next order quantity.
5. If the recursive call returns true, it means the current order quantity can be fulfilled. If not, it resets `dist[i]` to its original value.

The bug occurs in the line `if (dist[Arrays] >= quantity[j] && used.add(dist[i]))`. This line should use `dist[i]` instead of `dist[Arrays]`. This is a typo mistake.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line to `if (dist[i] >= quantity[j] && used.add(dist[i]))`.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canDistribute(int[] nums, int[] quantity) {

        // Use a map to count the numbers, ex: nums:[5,7,4,7,4,7] -> {5:1, 7:3, 4:2}
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums)
            freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);

        // Turn values of the map into array, ex: {5:1, 7:3, 4:2} -> [1, 3, 2]
        int[] dist = new int[freq.size()];
        int idx = 0;
        for (int f : freq.values())
            dist[idx++] = f;

        // Fullfill the quantities from the biggest
