The bug in the provided code is that it returns an empty string when no palindrome is found in the `words` array. However, the expected behavior is to return `null` instead of an empty string.

To fix this issue, we can change the return type of the method from `String` to `String` nullable.

Here's the modified code with the fix applied:

```java
class Solution {
    public String firstPalindrome(String[] words) {
        for (String s : words) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
            if (s.equals(sb.reverse().toString())) {
                return s;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

By changing the return type to `String` nullable, we can now correctly return `null` when no palindrome is found in the array.
