Analysis:
- The code uses two priority queues, `maxHeap` and `minHeap`, to simulate the asteroids' destruction process.
- `maxHeap` stores the asteroids in descending order of their masses.
- `minHeap` stores the asteroids in ascending order of their masses.
- The code iterates over each asteroid in `asteroids`, adds it to `maxHeap`, and then starts the destruction process.
- The destruction process continues until `maxHeap` is empty.
- In each iteration, the code removes the top element from `maxHeap` as the current asteroid.
- If the current asteroid can be destroyed (i.e., its mass is less than or equal to `bigMass`), the code adds its mass to `bigMass` and continues to destroy all asteroids in `minHeap` that can be destroyed.
- If the current asteroid cannot be destroyed, it is added to `minHeap`.
- Finally, the code returns `true` if both `minHeap` and `maxHeap` are empty, indicating that all asteroids have been destroyed.

Bug Type:
- The code is likely to have a bug related to integer overflow.
- The variable `bigMass` is declared as `long`, but the elements in `maxHeap` and `minHeap` are stored as `int`, which can cause integer overflow when adding `curr` to `bigMass`.

Solution:
- To fix the bug, we need to change the type of `maxHeap` and `minHeap` to match `bigMass` by making them `PriorityQueue<Long>`.
- We also need to change the comparison function in `maxHeap` to `(b, a) -> b.compareTo(a)` to ensure the correct order.
- After these changes, the code should correctly handle large masses without causing integer overflow.

            maxHeap.add((long) val);

        long bigMass = mass;

        while (maxHeap.size() > 0) {
            long curr = maxHeap.poll();

                bigMass += curr;
