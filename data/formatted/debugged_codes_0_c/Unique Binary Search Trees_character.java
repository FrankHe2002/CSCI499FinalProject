The bug in the provided code is a missing semicolon in the line `sol[0] = 1`. 

To identify the bug, we can go step-by-step through the code:
1. Initialize an array `sol` of length `n + 1`.
2. Set the first index of `sol` to 1, indicating that there is only one way to construct a tree with 0 elements.
3. Run a loop from 1 to `n+1`, where `i` represents the root index.
4. Within the loop, run a nested loop from 0 to `i`, where `j` represents the number of nodes in the left subtree.
5. Update the `i`-th position of the `sol` array by adding the multiplication of `sol[j]` (the number of unique left subtrees) and `sol[i - j - 1]` (the number of unique right subtrees) to account for all possible combinations of left and right subtrees for the current root (i).
6. Finally, return the value at the `n`-th index of the `sol` array, which represents the total number of unique Binary Search Trees that can be formed with `n` nodes.

To fix the bug, we simply need to add a semicolon at the end of the line `sol[0] = 1`.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        // Create 'sol' array of length n+1...
        int[] sol = new int[n + 1];
        // The value of the first index will be 1.
        sol[0] = 1;
        // Run a loop from 1 to n+1...
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Within the above loop, run a nested loop from 0 to i...
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                // Update the i-th position of the array by adding the multiplication of the respective index...
                sol[i] += sol[j] * sol[i - j - 1];
            }
        }
        // Return the value of the nth index of the array to get the solution...
        return sol[n];
    }
}
```
