There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the while loop condition `while (a >= nums.length)`. This condition is incorrect and will cause the loop to never execute. The correct condition should be `while (a < nums.length)` in order to iterate over all the elements of the array `nums`. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the while loop condition from `while (a >= nums.length)` to `while (a < nums.length)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int a = 0, z = 0, temp;
        while (a < nums.length) {
            if (nums[a] != 0) {
                temp = nums[z];
                nums[z] = nums[a];
                nums[a] = temp;
                z += 1;
            }
            a += 1;
        }
    }
}
```
