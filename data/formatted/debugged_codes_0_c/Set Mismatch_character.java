The bug in the provided code is the incorrect placement of the closing brace for the inner for loop. 

Currently, the closing brace of the inner for loop is placed after the check for `count == 2` and `count == 0`. This means that the `dup` and `miss` variables are updated inside the inner for loop, resulting in incorrect values.

To fix the bug, we need to move the closing brace of the inner for loop to the correct position, after the two if statements.
Additionally, we should add a return statement outside the outer for loop, after it has completed iterating through all the elements in the `nums` array.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int dup = 0, miss = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == i) count++;
            }

            if (count == 2) dup = i;
            if (count == 0) miss = i;
        }

        return new int[] {dup, miss};
    }
}
```

After fixing the bug, the code correctly iterates through the `nums` array and counts the occurrences of each number from 1 to `n`. The `dup` variable will store the number that appears twice, and the `miss` variable will store the number that is missing. The code then returns an array containing both values.

The time complexity of the code is O(n ^ 2) because for each number from 1 to `n`, we iterate through the `nums` array to count the occurrences. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using fixed amount of space to store the `dup` and `miss` variables, and the returned array.
