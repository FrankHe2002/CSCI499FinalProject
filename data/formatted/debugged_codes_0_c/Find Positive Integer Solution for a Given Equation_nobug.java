The given code implements a binary search algorithm to find pairs of integers that satisfy a given condition. Here are the steps to identify and fix the bug, if one exists:

1. The bug could be related to the initial values of `left` and `right` in the `binarySearch` method. We can check if these values are appropriate for the range of inputs we have.
2. Another potential bug could be related to the termination condition of the `while` loop in the `binarySearch` method. We should ensure that the loop terminates correctly.
3. Additionally, we need to verify the condition `if (res < ans)` used in the `binarySearch` method against the expected behavior specified in the problem statement.
4. Finally, the `findSolution` method needs to be reviewed to identify any potential issues in the logic.

To address these steps:

1. The initial values of `left` and `right` (1 and 1000 respectively) seem appropriate for the given range specified in the problem (1 <= x, y <= 1000). No bug found in this step.
2. The `while` loop terminates correctly when `left` becomes greater than `right` because that means no valid answer was found. No bug found in this step.
3. The condition `if (res < ans)` in the `binarySearch` method seems incorrect because we're looking for an answer that satisfies the condition `res == ans`, not `res < ans`.
4. The logic in the `findSolution` method seems correct. No bug found in this step.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition `if (res < ans)` to `if (res > ans)` in the `binarySearch` method.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    private int binarySearch(int ans, int x, CustomFunction func) {
        int left = 1, right = 1000;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int res = func.f(x, mid);
            if (res == ans) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (res > ans) { // Modified condition: res > ans
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
