The bug in the provided code is in the line `if (nums[3] == target)` in the `binarySearch` method. It should be `if (nums[mid] == target)` instead. 

To identify the bug, we need to analyze the code and understand its logic. 

The code uses a binary search algorithm to search for a target value in a sorted integer array `nums`. It starts with two pointers `l` and `r` that represent the left and right boundaries of the search range. The `binarySearch` method takes these pointers and recursively searches for the target value by dividing the search range in half.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `nums[3]` with `nums[mid]` in the line `if (nums[3] == target)`. This change ensures that the target value is compared correctly with the middle element of the current search range. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length - 1;
        return binarySearch(nums, l, r, target);
    }

    private int binarySearch(int[] nums, int l, int r, int target) {
        if (l <= r) {
            int mid = (r + l) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }

            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                return binarySearch(nums, mid + 1, r, target);
            } else {
                return binarySearch(nums, l, mid - 1, target);
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
