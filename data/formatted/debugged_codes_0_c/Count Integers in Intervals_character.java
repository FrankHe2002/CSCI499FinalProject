The bug in the code appears to be in the for loop condition in the `add` method. The condition `i.getKey) <= right` is missing the closing parenthesis and should be `i.getKey() <= right`.

To fix the bug, we need to add the missing closing parenthesis in the for loop condition.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class CountIntervals {

    //for storing intervals
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
    int count = 0;

    public CountIntervals() {
    }

    public void add(int left, int right) {
        //we are taking left side as reference and calculating ans

        //this is the current length
        int add = right - left + 1;

        //var is the default data type
        //lowerentry gives the value of smaller(smaller largest) entry compared to (left+1)
        //we added +1 bcz there may be a case where left is present in a map
        //lowerentry gives the  value(that is)<left+1
        var left_bound = map.lowerEntry(left + 1);


        //if there is some value present then go
        //getvalue gives the right positon
        //if current left is cover under map.right value means there is a overlap
        if (left_bound != null && left_bound.getValue() >= left) {
            //positions are map.left <= left <= min(map.right,right) <= max(map.right,right)

//examples:   (1)                       (2)                     (3)
//       ____________                 _________            _______________     (map)
//                ___________                  ________           ____         (our)

            //now, left become the smallest value which in this case is map.left
            left = left_bound.getKey();

            //same as right become the maximum value
            right = Math.max(left_bound.getValue(), right);

            //value overlap means curr answer(add) also change
            //we already calculated the map value (covered area) and added into ans variable
            //calculate/add the new uncovered value
            //    right            - map.right
            //max(right,map.right) - map.right
            //we are not adding +1 bcz that is already handled by overlaping area
            add = right - left_bound.getValue();

            //this is taken so we have to remove
            //at last we added the largest area (which is stored int left,right)
