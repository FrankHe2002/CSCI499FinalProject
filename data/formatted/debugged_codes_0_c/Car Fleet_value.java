The bug in the provided code is in the `compareTo` method of the `pair` class. In the comparison `return o.pos - this.pos;`, the subtraction is in reverse order, which means it will return a negative value instead of a positive value as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to reverse the order of subtraction in the `compareTo` method. The corrected code would be:

```java
public int compareTo(pair o) {
    return this.pos - o.pos;
}
```

Additionally, there is a logical error in the calculation of the arrival time in the `carFleet` method. The formula `(target - position[i]) * 1.1 / speed[i]` should be `(double)(target - position[i]) / speed[i]` to accurately calculate the arrival time. 

The corrected code would be:

```java
arr[i] = (double)(target - position[i]) / speed[i];
```

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 186 ms (Top 36.59%) | Memory: 87.4 MB (Top 48.79%)
class Solution {
    class pair implements Comparable<pair> {
        int pos;
        double time;

        pair(int pos, double time) {
            this.pos = pos;
            this.time = time;
        }

        public int compareTo(pair o) {
            return this.pos - o.pos;
        }
    }

    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        double[] arr = new double[position.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
            arr[i] = (double)(target - position[i]) / speed[i];
        }
        PriorityQueue<pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
            pq.add(new pair(position[i], arr[i]));
        }
        double updatetime = 0;
        int fleet = 0;
        while (pq.size() > 0) {
            pair rem = pq.remove();
            if (updatetime < rem.time) {
                fleet++;
                updatetime = rem.time;
            }
        }
        return fleet;
    }
}
```
