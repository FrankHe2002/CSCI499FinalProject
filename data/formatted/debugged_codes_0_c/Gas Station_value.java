The bug in the provided code is that it does not consider the possibility of not being able to complete a circuit. The code checks if the total fuel is less than the total cost, but it does not handle the case where it is not possible to complete a circuit even if the total fuel is equal to or greater than the total cost.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to check if it is possible to complete a circuit starting from each index. We can do this by adding a check after the second for loop that verifies if the current fuel is negative. If it is negative, we reset the start index to the next index and reset the current fuel to 0.

Here is the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalFuel = 0;
        int totalCost = 0;
        int n = gas.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalFuel += gas[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += cost[i];
        }
        if (totalFuel < totalCost) {
            return -1;
        }

        int start = 0;
        int currFuel = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currFuel += (gas[i] - cost[i]);
            if (currFuel < 0) {
                start = i + 1;
                currFuel = 0;
            }
        }

        if (start == n) {
            return -1;
        }

        // Check if it is possible to complete a circuit starting from start index
        currFuel = 0;
        for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {
            currFuel += (gas[i] - cost[i]);
            if (currFuel < 0) {
                return -1;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < start; i++) {
            currFuel += (gas[i] - cost[i]);
            if (currFuel < 0) {
                return -1;
            }
        }

        return start;
    }
}
```
In the fixed code, we added two additional for loops to check if it is possible to complete a circuit starting from the start index. The first loop checks from start index to the end of the array, and the
