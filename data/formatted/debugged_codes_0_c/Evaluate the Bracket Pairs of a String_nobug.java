Bug Type: Off-by-one Error

Reasoning:
- The code intends to extract a substring using a starting index (`b_start`) and an ending index (`i`).
- It uses `b_start + 1` as the starting index and `i` as the ending index in the `substring` method.
- However, this calculation is one index off.
- The correct starting index should be `b_start + 1` and the correct ending index should be `i + 1`.

To fix the bug, update the substring extraction line as follows:
```java
String key = s.substring(b_start + 1, i + 1);
```
