Bug: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning Process:
1. The code sorts the tasks array using a custom comparator. The comparator compares the difference between the second element and the first element of each task array.
2. After sorting, the code initializes two variables: `sum` to keep track of the sum of effort required so far, and `max` to keep track of the maximum effort required.
3. The code then enters a for loop to iterate through the tasks array. The loop condition is `i <= tasks.length`, which is incorrect. Since arrays are zero-indexed, accessing `tasks[tasks.length]` will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
4. The loop body updates the `max` variable by taking the maximum of the current `max` and the sum of `sum` and the second element of the current task. It also updates the `sum` variable by adding the first element of the current task.
5. The loop continues to execute, eventually accessing `tasks[tasks.length]` and causing the exception.

Fix:
Change the loop condition from `i <= tasks.length` to `i < tasks.length`.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minimumEffort(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                return (b[1] - b[0]) - (a[1] - a[0]);
            }
        });
        int sum = 0, max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, sum + tasks[i][1]);
            sum += tasks[i][0];
        }

        return max;

    }
}
```
