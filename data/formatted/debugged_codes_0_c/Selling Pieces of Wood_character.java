Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The given code calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by selling pieces of wood of different lengths and widths.
2. The code initializes a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` to store the maximum values.
3. It then iterates through the `prices` array to set the initial values in `dp` array based on the prices.
4. The code uses a nested loop to calculate the maximum value for each combination of lengths and widths.
5. For each combination, the code checks all possible horizontal and vertical cuts of the wood to find the maximum value.
6. The values are stored in the `dp` array.
7. Finally, the code returns the maximum value for the given dimensions `m` and `n`.

Bug:

The code has a missing closing `}` for the outer for-loop. As a result, the code will not compile and will throw a compilation error.

Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to add a closing `}` before the return statement to close the outer for-loop.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long sellingWood(int m, int n, int[][] prices) {
        long[][] dp = new long[m + 1][n + 1];
        for (int[] price : prices) {
            dp[price[0]][price[1]] = price[2];
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n + 1; j++) {
                // all horizontal
                for (int k = 1; k <= i / 2; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - k][j] + dp[k][j]);
                }
                // all vertical
                for (int k = 1; k <= j / 2; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - k] + dp[i][k]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
