The bug in the provided code is in the condition `if (start == - 0)` in the `canChoose` method. 

The reasoning process to identify and fix the bug is as follows:

1. The condition `if (start == - 0)` seems strange because `- 0` is the same as `0`. So, it is more likely that it was intended to check if `start` is equal to `-1`, indicating that the group was not found.
2. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if (start == -1)`.
3. The fix can be applied by replacing `if (start == - 0)` with `if (start == -1)` in the `canChoose` method.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int search(int[] group, int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        int i = start, j = 0;
        while (i < end && j < group.length) {
            if (nums[i] == group[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;

                if (j == group.length)
                    return i;
            } else {
                i = i - j + 1;
                j = 0;
            }

        }
        return - 1;
    }

    public boolean canChoose(int[][] groups, int[] nums) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length;

        for (int[] group : groups) {
            start = search(group, nums, start, end);
            if (start == -1)
                return false;
        }

        return true;

    }
}
```
