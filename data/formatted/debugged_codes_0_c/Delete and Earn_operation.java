Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
1. The code sorts the input array in ascending order.
2. It then iterates through the sorted array to calculate the maximum sum of elements that can be obtained, considering the constraint that if a number is chosen, all occurrences of that number in the array must be chosen as well.
3. The code uses two variables: "previous" to store the maximum sum of elements up to the previous number and "onePreviousAgo" to store the maximum sum of elements up to the number before the previous number. These variables are updated at each step of the iteration.
4. However, there is a bug in the logic of updating these variables when encountering a number that is not consecutive to the previous number.

Fix:
1. Initialize "onePreviousAgo" to 0 before the loop starts.
2. Inside the loop, check if "nums[i] - 1" is greater than the number before the previous number. If it is, update "onePreviousAgo" to the current value of "previous" and not the previous value of "previous".
3. Apply the minimal changes to fix the bug.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int onePreviousAgo = 0;
        int previous = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            if (i > 0 && nums[i - 1] < nums[i] - 1) {
                onePreviousAgo = previous; // Fix: Update to current value of "previous"
            }
            while (i < nums.length - 1 && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                sum += nums[i];
                i++;
            }
            int currentPrevious = previous;
            previous = Math.max(onePreviousAgo * nums[i] + sum, previous);
            onePreviousAgo = currentPrevious;
        }
        return previous;
    }
}
```

The bug is fixed by updating the logic of updating the "onePreviousAgo" variable when encountering a number that is not consecutive to the previous number.
