The provided Java code has a bug in the following line:

```java
count += (set.contains(s.charAt(i))) ? ((i < mid) ? 1 : * 1) : 0;
```

The bug is in the expression `((i < mid) ? 1 : * 1)`. The `*` operator does not have a valid operand after it, and it seems to be a mistake.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to remove the `* 1` from the expression. The correct line should be:

```java
count += (set.contains(s.charAt(i))) ? ((i < mid) ? 1 : -1) : 0;
```

Explanation:

The code is trying to count the number of vowels in the left half of the input string `s` and decrement the count for the vowels in the right half of the string. The count should be 0 if the number of vowels in the two halves is the same.

The bug can be identified by carefully examining the expression `((i < mid) ? 1 : * 1)`. The syntax `* 1` is incorrect and does not have any meaning. It seems like a typo or a mistake when writing the code.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `* 1` with `-1`. This change ensures that the count is decremented by 1 for the vowels in the right half of the string.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean halvesAreAlike(String s) {
        //add vowels to the set
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add('a');
        set.add('e');
        set.add('i');
        set.add('o');
        set.add('u');
        set.add('A');
        set.add('E');
        set.add('I');
        set.add('O');
        set.add('U');

        //find the mid
        int mid = s.length() / 2;
        int count = 0;
        //increment the count for left half, decrement count for the second half if its a vowel
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
            count += (set.contains(s.charAt(i))) ? ((i < mid) ? 1 : -1) : 0;
        //finally count should be 0 to match left and right half
        return count == 0;
    }
}
```
