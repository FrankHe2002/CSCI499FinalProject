The provided Java code attempts to find the nth digit in a sequence of numbers. The code starts with a digit index of 9 and iterates through the numbers until it reaches the digit index specified by the input 'n'.

Upon review, there is a bug in the code. The bug occurs when the digit index is equal to the total number of digits in the current number. In this case, the code enters a loop that continuously divides the current number by 10, resulting in an infinite loop.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the first if statement checking if 'currDigitIndex' is equal to 'n'. Instead of an equality check, we should use a greater than check to ensure we exit the loop when 'currDigitIndex' becomes greater than 'n'.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findNthDigit(int n) {

        if (n < 10)
            return n;

        long currDigitIndex = 9;
        int tillNextIncrease = 90;
        int currNumberSize = 2;
        int currNumber = 10;
        int next = tillNextIncrease;

        while (currDigitIndex < n) {

            currNumber++;
            currDigitIndex += currNumberSize;
            next--;

            if (next == 0) {
                currNumberSize++;
                tillNextIncrease *= 10;
                next = tillNextIncrease;
            }
        }

        int nthDigit = currNumber % 10;
        if (currDigitIndex > n) {
            currNumber--;

            while (currDigitIndex > n) {
                currDigitIndex--;
                nthDigit = currNumber % 10;
                currNumber /= 10;
            }
        }

        return nthDigit;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code should now correctly find the nth digit in the sequence.
