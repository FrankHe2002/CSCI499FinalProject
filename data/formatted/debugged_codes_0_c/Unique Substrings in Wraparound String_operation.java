The code computes the length of the longest continuous substring in the given string `p`, where the substring is formed by consecutive characters in the English alphabet.

After reviewing the code, there doesn't appear to be any syntax errors or logical flaws. However, there is one minor bug in the code related to indexing the `counts` array.

The bug is in this line of code:

```java
int idx = ch % 'a';
```

The goal of this line is to calculate the index for storing the counts of each character in the `counts` array. However, since the array has a length of 26 (representing the 26 alphabets), indexing should be done based on the difference between the character and `'a'`, not the modulus. This can be fixed by using:

```java
int idx = ch - 'a';
```

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findSubstringInWraproundString(String p) {
        final int N = p.length();
        int res = 0, len = 1;
        int[] counts = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            char ch = p.charAt(i);
            if (i > 0 && (ch - p.charAt(i - 1) == 1 || ch - p.charAt(i - 1) == - 25)) {
                len++;
            } else {
                len = 1;
            }
            int idx = ch - 'a';
            counts[idx] = Math.max(counts[idx], len);
        }
        for (int count : counts) {
            res += count;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
