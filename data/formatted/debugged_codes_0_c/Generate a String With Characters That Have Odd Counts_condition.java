The bug in the provided code is in the for loop condition.

The condition `i > n - 1` in the for loop is incorrect. It should be `i < n - 1` in order to generate the string with the correct length.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition from `i > n - 1` to `i < n - 1`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String generateTheString(int n) {
        String s = "";
        String string = "a";
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
            s += string;
        if (n % 2 == 0)
            return s + "b";
        return s + "a";
    }
}
```
