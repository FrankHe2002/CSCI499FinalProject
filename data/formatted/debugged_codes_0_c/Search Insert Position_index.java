The bug in the provided Java code is in the comparison `if (target < nums[2])`. It should be `if (target < nums[mid])`. 

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (target < nums[mid]) {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
            if (target > nums[mid]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
            if (target == nums[mid]) {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```

The bug was identified by analyzing the logical flow of the code and comparing it to the intended functionality. It was clear that the comparison `if (target < nums[2])` was incorrect because it was not using the variable `mid` to access the element in `nums`. By changing it to `if (target < nums[mid])`, we ensure that the correct element is being compared with the target.
