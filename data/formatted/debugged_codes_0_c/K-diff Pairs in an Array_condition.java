The bug in the provided code is in the condition inside the second for loop. The condition `k > 0 && map.containsKey(i + k) || k != 0 && map.get(i) > 1` is incorrect.

To identify the bug, we need to understand the purpose of the code. The code is trying to find pairs of numbers from the given array `nums` such that the difference between the numbers is equal to `k`. The variable `k` represents the desired difference.

Looking at the condition in the provided code:
1. `k > 0 && map.containsKey(i + k)` checks if there is a number `i+k` in the input array.
2. `k != 0 && map.get(i) > 1` checks if there are multiple occurrences of number `i` in the input array.

The condition is using the logical OR (`||`) operator. This means that if any of the two conditions are true, the result will be true. However, the intention of the code is to find pairs of numbers that satisfy both conditions, i.e., both conditions must be true.

To fix the bug, we should add parentheses around the individual conditions to enforce the correct order of evaluation. The fixed condition should be `(k > 0 && map.containsKey(i + k)) || (k != 0 && map.get(i) > 1)`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        for (int num : nums)
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);

        int result = 0;
        for (int i : map.keySet())
            if ((k > 0 && map.containsKey(i + k)) || (k != 0 && map.get(i) > 1))
                result++;
        return result;
    }
}
```
