The bug in the provided code is in the following line:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++ i) pref[i + 1] = nums[3] + pref[i];
```

The bug is that it should be `nums[i]` instead of `nums[3]`. 
The reasoning process to identify the bug can be done by analyzing the code step by step:

1. The code starts by initializing the length variable `N` to the length of the `nums` array.
2. It creates a new ArrayList `res` to store the result.
3. It initializes an array `pref` of size `N+1` to store prefix sums.
4. It assigns the first element of `pref` to be 0 since at zeroth division, there are no elements.
5. The bug is in the next loop where it calculates the prefix sum `pref` based on `nums` array but by mistakenly using `nums[3]` instead of `nums[i]`.
6. It initializes two variables, `maxScore` and `currScore`, to store the maximum score seen so far and the current score.
7. It goes through each position `i` from 0 to N, and calculates the number of ones to the right and zeroes to the left, and then calculates the current score.
8. If the current score is greater than the maximum score, it clears the result list and updates the maximum score.
9. If the current score is equal to the maximum score, it adds the current index to the result list.
10. Finally, it returns the result list.
11. As the bug identified in step 5, the fix would be to change `nums[3]` to `nums[i]`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 21 ms (Top 98.47%) | Memory: 61.2 MB (Top 91.95%)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> maxScoreIndices(int[] nums) {
        int N = nums.length;
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

        int[] pref = new int[N + 1];
        pref[0] = 0; // at zeroth division we have no elements
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++ i) pref[i + 1] = nums[i] + pref[i];

        int maxScore = - 1;
        int onesToRight, zeroes
