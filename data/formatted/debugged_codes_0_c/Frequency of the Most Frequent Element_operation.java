Bug type: Syntax error

Reasoning process:

1. The provided code does not compile due to a syntax error in the line `//Step-2: Two-Pointers%>`.
2. The syntax `%>` is not a valid Java syntax. It appears to be a comment marker, but it is missing the comment characters `/*` and `*/`.
3. The code needs to be modified to fix this syntax error.

Fix:

Replace the line `//Step-2: Two-Pointers%>` with `//Step-2: Two-Pointers`.

Updated code:

```java
// Runtime: 46 ms (Top 33.83%) | Memory: 95.9 MB (Top 65.95%)
class Solution {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        //Step-1: Sorting->
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        //Step-2: Two-Pointers
        int L = 0, R = 0;
        long totalSum = 0;
        int res = 1;
        //Iterating over the array:
        while (R < nums.length) {
            totalSum += nums[R];
            //The value of "totalSum+k" should be ">=" "windowSize*nums[R]"
            //then only the window is possible else decrease the "totalSum"
            //till the value "totalSum+k" is ">=" "windowSize*nums[R]"
            while (! ((totalSum + k) >= ((R - L + 1) * nums[R]))) {
                totalSum -= nums[L];
                L++;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, (R - L + 1));
            R++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
