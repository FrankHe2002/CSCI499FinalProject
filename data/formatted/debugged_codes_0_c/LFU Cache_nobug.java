There are a few potential bugs in the provided Java code:

1. In the `ins` method of the `List` class, the `size` variable is not incremented after inserting a new node. This could result in incorrect size calculations.
2. In the `del` method of the `List` class, the `size` variable is not decremented after deleting a node. This could result in incorrect size calculations.
3. In the `put` method of the `LFUCache` class, the condition `if (maxSize == 0)` should be checked before performing any further operations. Currently, it is checked after performing some operations, which could lead to unnecessary computations.
4. In the `put` method of the `LFUCache` class, when the maximum size is reached and an element needs to be removed, the LRU (least recently used) element is removed. However, the code mistakenly removes the tail's previous element, which is not necessarily the LRU element. To fix this, the code should remove the tail's next element instead.
5. In the `updateFreq` method of the `LFUCache` class, the new node is not inserted into the key-node map (`mp`) after its frequency is updated. The line `mp.remove(newNode.key)` should be followed by `mp.put(newNode.key, newNode)`.

Here is the modified code with the above bugs fixed:

```java
class LFUCache {
    // Declare Node class for Doubly Linked List 
    class Node {
        int key, value, freq;// to store key,value and frequency
        Node prev, next;// Next and Previous Pointers

        Node(int k, int v) {
            // initializing in constructor
            key = k;
            value = v;
            freq = 1;
        }

    }

    // Declare class for List of Doubly Linked List
    class List {
        int size;
        Node head, tail;

        List() {
            // initializing in constructor
            size = 0;
            head = new Node(- 1, - 1);// Default values
            tail = new Node(- 1, - 1);
            head.next = tail;
            tail.prev = head;
        }

        // To insert at the start of the list
        void ins(Node newNode) {
            Node temp = head.next;
            head.next = newNode;
            newNode.prev = head;
            newNode.next = temp;
            temp.prev = newNode;
            size
