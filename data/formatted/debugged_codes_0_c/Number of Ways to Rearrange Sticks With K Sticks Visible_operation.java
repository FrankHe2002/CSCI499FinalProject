There are a few issues with the provided Java code.

1. In the nested for loop, the calculation of `M[i][j]` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `(j-1) * M[i][j-1] + M[i-1][j-1]`, but the current code has it as `((j - 1) * M[i][j - 1] % MOD + M[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. The modulo operation should be applied only at the end, after the addition and multiplication.

2. The use of `long` type for the `M` array is unnecessary. Since the result is being returned as an `int`, using `long` type for the array adds unnecessary memory usage.

To fix these issues, the following changes can be made to the code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 38.6 MB (Top 76.06%)
class Solution {
    public int rearrangeSticks(int n, int k) {
        final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        int[][] M = new int[k + 1][n + 1];
        M[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                M[i][j] = ((j - 1) * M[i][j - 1] + M[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        return M[k][n];
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the `M` array is changed to `int` type instead of `long`, and the modulo operation is applied at the end of the calculation for `M[i][j]`. This fixes the bug in the original code and improves the code's efficiency by avoiding unnecessary memory usage.
