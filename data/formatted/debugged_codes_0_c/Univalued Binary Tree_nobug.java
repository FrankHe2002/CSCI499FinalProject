The provided code checks if all nodes in a binary tree have the same value. It uses a depth-first search traversal to check each node's value against the first value encountered.

Upon reviewing the code, one potential bug that can be identified is that the `firstVal` variable is not being set correctly. It is set to `0` initially, but if the tree contains negative values, `0` may be a valid value for some nodes. 

To fix this bug, we should set the `firstVal` variable to the value of the root node initially. This will ensure that the comparison in the `traversal` method is correct.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    boolean ans = true;
    int firstVal;

    public boolean isUnivalTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return ans;
        firstVal = root.val;
        traversal(root);
        return ans;
    }

    private void traversal(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return;
        if (root.val != firstVal)
            ans = false;
        traversal(root.left);
        traversal(root.right);
    }
}
```
