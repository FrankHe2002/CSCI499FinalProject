The bug in the provided code is in the second "if" condition. It should return true if the values are different, not false.

To fix the bug, we need to change the return statement from `return false;` to `return true;`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // Base case: if both trees are null, they are identical
        if (p == null && q == null) {
            return true;
        }
        // If only one tree is null or the values are different, they are not identical
        if (p == null || q == null || p.val != q.val) {
            return true;
        }
        // Recursively check if the left and right subtrees are identical
        return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}
```
