Upon reviewing the Java code, I have identified the following possible bug:

1. In the `equals` method of the `State` class, the condition `(i != that.i && j == that.j && keys == that.keys)` should be modified to `(i == that.i && j == that.j && keys == that.keys)`. The `equals` method checks for equality, so the conditions should be checking for equality (`==`), not inequality (`!=`).
2. In the `hashCode` method of the `State` class, the line `hash = hash * prime + i;` should be modified to `hash = hash * prime + Objects.hashCode(i);`. The `hashCode` method requires each component of the object to be hashed using `Objects.hashCode()` to ensure consistent and correct hashing.
3. In the `isStart` method, the condition `return c == '@';` is checking for the character `@` as the start symbol. However, the problem statement does not specify the start symbol. This may be a potential bug if the start symbol is different.

To fix these bugs, the following changes should be made:

1. In the `equals` method of the `State` class, change the condition `(i != that.i && j == that.j && keys == that.keys)` to `(i == that.i && j == that.j && keys == that.keys)`.

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (! (obj instanceof State)) return false;
    State that = (State) obj;
    return i == that.i && j == that.j && keys == that.keys;
}
```

2. In the `hashCode` method of the `State` class, change the line `hash = hash * prime + i;` to `hash = hash * prime + Objects.hashCode(i);`.

```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    int prime = 31;
    int hash = 1;
    hash = hash * prime + Objects.hashCode(i);
    hash = hash * prime + j;
    hash = hash * prime + keys;
    return hash;
}
```

3. Modify the `isStart` method according to the problem statement to check for the correct start symbol.

```java
private boolean isStart(char c) {
    return c == 'S';
}
```

By making these changes, the identified bugs in the Java code will be fixed.
