The provided code is meant to find the index of the chalk element that would be used up when given the number of times the chalk is used (k). However, there is a bug in the code:

Bug Type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes the `left` variable as the remainder of `k` divided by the sum of all the elements in the `chalk` array.
2. The code then loops through each element in the `chalk` array.
3. If the remaining amount (`left`) is greater than or equal to the current element, the current element is subtracted from the remaining amount.
4. If the remaining amount (`left`) is less than the current element, the code should return the current index.
5. However, the bug is in the return statement. Instead of returning the current index (`i`), the code returns `+1` which would always evaluate to 1.

To fix the bug, the return statement should be changed to `return i;` so that the correct index is returned. 

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {

    public int chalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) {
            sum += c;
        }
        long left = k % sum;
        for (int i = 0; i < chalk.length; i++) {
            if (left >= chalk[i]) {
                left -= chalk[i];
            } else {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;  // Placeholder return statement, change accordingly
    }
}
```
