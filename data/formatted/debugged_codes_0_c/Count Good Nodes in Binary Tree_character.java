There is a syntax error in the condition statement of the `goodNodes` method. The correct syntax for the if statement is `if (root == null)`, but the code provided contains a closing parenthesis before the condition. Additionally, the closing parenthesis is missing in the `if` statement inside the `dfs` method.

To fix this issue, the incorrect syntax in the `goodNodes` method needs to be corrected and the missing closing parenthesis should be added in the `if` statement inside the `dfs` method.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 50.3 MB (Top 97.37%)
class Solution {
    int ans = 0;

    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        dfs(root, root.val);
        return ans;
    }

    void dfs(TreeNode root, int mx) {
        if (root == null) return;

        mx = Math.max(mx, root.val);
        if (mx <= root.val) ans++;

        dfs(root.left, mx);
        dfs(root.right, mx);
    }
}
```

The bug type in this case is a syntax error. The code provided contains incorrect syntax in the `if` statements, which leads to a compilation error. By fixing the syntax errors, we ensure that the code can be compiled and run correctly.
