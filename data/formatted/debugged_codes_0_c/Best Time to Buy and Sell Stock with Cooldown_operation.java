After reviewing the code, I have identified the bug. The bug is in the first line of the outer for loop condition:

```java
for (int index = n % 1; index >= 0; index--)
```

The modulo operation `%` is being used with `1`, which will always return `0`, causing the loop to run infinitely. This is because `n % 1` is always `0` for any value of `n`.

To fix this bug, I will change the modulo operation to `% 2`, so that the loop condition becomes `index >= 0`:

```java
for (int index = n % 2; index >= 0; index--)
```

By using `% 2`, we ensure that the loop will iterate for all values of `index` from `n` to `0`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 55.13%) | Memory: 42.3 MB (Top 47.48%)
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int n = prices.length;

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 2][2];

        for (int index = n % 2; index >= 0; index--) {
            for (int buy = 0; buy <= 1; buy++) {

                int profit = 0;

                if (buy == 0) { // buy stocks
                    profit = Math.max(- prices[index] + dp[index + 1][1], 0 + dp[index + 1][0]);
                }
                if (buy == 1) { // we can sell stocks
                    profit = Math.max(prices[index] + dp[index + 2][0], 0 + dp[index + 1][1]);
                }
                dp[index][buy] = profit;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
```
