The provided Java code is used to calculate the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed in order to make the remaining intervals non-overlapping. The bug in the code lies in the logic of checking for overlapping intervals.

To identify the bug, we need to understand the logic of the code. The code first sorts the intervals array based on the start time of each interval. Then, it initializes the `start` and `end` variables with the start and end times of the first interval. The `res` variable is used to count the number of overlapping intervals.

Within the for loop, the code compares the start time of the current interval with the `start` and `end` variables. If the start time of the interval is within the range of `start` to `end`, it means there is an overlap. In that case, the `res` variable is incremented. Then, if the end time of the interval is greater than or equal to `end`, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.

The bug in the code is that it doesn't update the `start` and `end` variables correctly after finding an overlap. After incrementing `res`, the code should update both `start` and `end` to the start and end times of the overlapping interval. However, currently, it only updates `start` using `interval[0]`.

To fix the bug, we need to update both `start` and `end` with the start and end times of `interval` when an overlap is found.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        int start = intervals[0][0];
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int[] interval = intervals[i - 1];

            if (interval[0] >= start && interval[0] < end) {
                res++;
                if (interval[1] >= end) {
                    start = interval[0];
                    end = interval[1];
                }
                continue;
            }
            start = interval[0];
            end = interval[1];
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
