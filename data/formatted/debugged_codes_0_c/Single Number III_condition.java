Upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that there is no bug. The code is a solution to the problem of finding two unique numbers in an array where all other numbers occur twice. 

The code utilizes bitwise XOR operation to find the XOR of all the numbers in the array. This XOR value will have 1s in positions where the two unique numbers have different bits. 

Then, the code finds the rightmost bit that is set to 1 in the XOR value. This rightmost bit will be used to split the array into two groups. Numbers that have the rightmost bit set to 1 will be XORed together to find one of the unique numbers, and numbers that have the rightmost bit set to 0 will be XORed together to find the other unique number. 

The code correctly implements this logic and returns the two unique numbers in an array. There is no bug in the code.
