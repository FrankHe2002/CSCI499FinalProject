The bug in the provided Java code is in the `reverse` method. The bug is caused by the incorrect condition in the while loop. 

To identify and fix the bug, we need to analyze the code step-by-step:

1. In the `rotate` method, the code calls the `reverse` method three times in order to rotate the array `nums` to the right by `k` steps.
2. The first call to `reverse` is used to reverse the entire array. This effectively brings the last `k` elements to the front of the array.
3. The second call to `reverse` is used to reverse the first `k` elements of the array, which puts the last `k` elements back to their original positions.
4. The third call to `reverse` is used to reverse the remaining elements of the array, effectively moving the first `k` elements to the end of the array.

The bug is in the `reverse` method:

1. The `while` loop condition (`start >= end`) is incorrect. It should be `start <= end` instead. The loop should continue until `start` becomes greater than `end`.
2. Due to the incorrect condition, the `reverse` method does not execute the swapping logic at all, resulting in no changes to the array.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `while` loop to `start <= end`:

```java
public static void reverse(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
    while (start <= end) {
        int temp = arr[start];
        arr[start] = arr[end];
        arr[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the `reverse` method correctly reverses the elements in the given range of the array.

Note: No changes are required in the `rotate` method.
