Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:
1. The code seems to be creating a snapshot array using TreeMap to store the elements.
2. The set method is used to set a value at a specific index in the snapshot array.
3. The snap method is used to create a snapshot by incrementing the currSnapId.
4. The get method is used to get a value at a specific index and snapshot id.
5. In the get method, the lowerKey is obtained by using floorKey method of the TreeMap with the given snap_id.
6. If lowerKey is null, it means the snap_id is less than the lowest key in the TreeMap, so it returns the value associated with the lowerKey.
7. Otherwise, it returns 0.

After analyzing the code, it seems that the bug lies in the get method:

```java
if (lowerKey == null) {
    return snapshotArray[index].get(lowerKey);
}
```

If lowerKey is null, it shouldn't be passed to the snapshotArray's get method because it will throw a NullPointerException.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to check if lowerKey is not null:

```java
if (lowerKey != null) {
    return snapshotArray[index].get(lowerKey);
}
```

Fixed Java code:

```java
class SnapshotArray {

    TreeMap<Integer, Integer>[] snapshotArray;
    int currSnapId;

    public SnapshotArray(int length) {
        snapshotArray = new TreeMap[length];
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            snapshotArray[i] = new TreeMap();
        }
        currSnapId = 0;
    }

    public void set(int index, int val) {
        snapshotArray[index].put(currSnapId, val);
    }

    public int snap() {
        return currSnapId++;
    }

    public int get(int index, int snap_id) {
        Integer lowerKey = snapshotArray[index].floorKey(snap_id);

        if (lowerKey != null) {
            return snapshotArray[index].get(lowerKey);
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by changing the if condition in the get method. Now the code should work correctly without throwing a NullPointerException.
