Bug type: Logic Error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is aiming to find duplicate subtrees in a binary tree.
2. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and generate hashes for each subtree.
3. The generated hashes are compared to a set to check for duplicates.
4. If a duplicate hash is found, the corresponding subtree is added to the list of duplicate subtrees.
5. The code uses two sets, `hashes` and `added`, to keep track of generated hashes and already added subtrees respectively.
6. The main bug in the code is that the generated hash is not properly passed to the recursive DFS function. Instead, a new hash string is created within the function and appended to.
7. This leads to incorrect result as the recursive function does not update the hash correctly.
8. Additionally, the code unnecessarily uses a stack to perform DFS. 

Fix:
1. Modify the `dfs` function to take the hash as a parameter, instead of creating a new hash within the function.
2. Remove the unnecessary stack and replace it with recursive calls to the `dfs` function.
