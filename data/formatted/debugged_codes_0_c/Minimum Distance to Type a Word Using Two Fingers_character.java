The code seems to have a bug in the line `memo[index][finger1 - 'A'][finger2 - 'A'] = ans`. It seems that there is a missing semicolon at the end of this line.

To fix this bug, we can simply add a semicolon at the end of the line as follows:

```java
memo[index][finger1 - 'A'][finger2 - 'A'] = ans;
```

This will correct the bug and the code should run without any issues.
