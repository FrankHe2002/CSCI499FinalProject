Based on the provided Java code, the bug appears to be a misspelling of the class keyword "class". Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 39 MB (Top 95.77%)
class Solution {
    public double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        if (n == 1)
            return (double) 1;
        return (double) 1 / 2;
    }
}
```

To identify the bug, we can go through the code line by line and confirm if it is correctly written. 

1. The code starts by defining a class named "Solution" which suggests it is a solution to a specific problem.
2. Inside the class, there is a method named "nthPersonGetsNthSeat" which takes an integer parameter "n" and returns a double value.
3. In the method, there is a condition that checks if "n" is equal to 1. If it is, the method returns 1 as a double value.
4. If the condition in step 3 is not satisfied (meaning "n" is not equal to 1), the method returns 1 divided by 2 as a double value. This suggests that the code assumes there are only 2 seats, but this may not be correct.

To fix the code, we need to understand the logic behind it. The code seems to be solving a problem where "n" represents the number of people in line and the goal is to find the probability that the "n-th" person gets their own seat. According to the problem's description, the probability is always 1/2.

Therefore, the code can be simplified to remove the unnecessary condition. Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        return (double) 1 / 2;
    }
}
```
