There is a bug in the provided Java code. The bug is in the `containsKey` method of the `Node` class.

```java
boolean containsKey(int ind) {
    return links[bit] != null;
}
```

The bug is that the parameter in the method signature is named `ind`, but the variable used inside the method is named `bit`. This would cause a compilation error since the variable `bit` is not defined in this context.

To fix the bug, I will change the parameter name from `ind` to `bit`.

```java
boolean containsKey(int bit) {
    return links[bit] != null;
}
```
