There are a few syntax errors and bugs in the provided code:

1. Syntax error: The opening bracket is not placed correctly in the method declaration, causing a compilation error.

2. Syntax error: The parameter names in the method declaration are not separated by a comma, causing a compilation error.

3. Bug: The initial value of `j` is set to -1, which causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing `nums[j]` in the while loop.

4. Bug: The while loop is not terminated when `j` reaches the end of the array `nums`, causing an infinite loop.

To fix these issues, we can make the following changes to the code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                count++;
            }
            while (count > k) {
                if (nums[j] == 0) {
                    count--;
                }
                j++;
            }
            int len = i - j + 1;
            if (len > ans) ans = len;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added the missing closing bracket in the method declaration.
2. Fixed the syntax error by separating the parameter names with a comma.
3. Changed the initial value of `j` to 0.
4. Moved the increment of `j` to the end of the while loop.
5. Adjusted the calculation of `len` to include the current element `i`.
