After reviewing the provided Java code, the bug I have identified is that the variable "discount" is declared as an int, but it should be declared as a double to correctly calculate the final bill with the discount.

To fix this bug, I will change the declaration of the "discount" variable from int to double in the constructor of the Cashier class.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Cashier {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> catalogue;

    private int n;
    private double discount;
    private int orderNumber;

    public Cashier(int n, double discount, int[] products, int[] prices) {
        this.catalogue = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            this.catalogue.put(products[i], prices[i]);
        }

        this.n = n;
        this.discount = ((double) 100 - discount) / 100;
        this.orderNumber = 0;
    }

    public double getBill(int[] product, int[] amount) {
        this.orderNumber++;

        double bill = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < amount.length; i++) {
            int p = product[i];
            int price = this.catalogue.get(p);
            bill += price * amount[i];
        }

        if (this.orderNumber % n == 0)
            bill *= this.discount;

        return bill;
    }
}
```

In this fix, I have changed the declaration of the "discount" variable in the constructor from `int discount` to `double discount`. This will ensure that the discount is correctly calculated and applied to the final bill.
