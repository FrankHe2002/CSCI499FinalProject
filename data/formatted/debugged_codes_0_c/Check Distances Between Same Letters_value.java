Based on the given code and the code comments, it seems that the code is intended to check if the distances between the first and second occurrence of each character in a given string match the corresponding distances stored in the `distance` array. 

However, there is a bug in the code that prevents it from working correctly. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the distance (`diff`) between the first and second occurrence of a character. The code uses `i - start - 1` to calculate the distance, but it should actually be `i - start`.

To fix the bug, the line `int diff = i - start - 1;` should be modified to `int diff = i - start;`.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 40.7%) | Memory: 41.77 MB (Top 46.5%)

/*
Use map to store the character and the index of its first occurance
And when the second occurance found, count the elemnets in between
and check in distance[] whether the distance at the place is correct or not
*/
class Solution {
    public boolean checkDistances(String s, int[] distance) {

        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int len = arr.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(arr[i])) {
                int start = map.get(arr[i]);
                int diff = i - start;
                if (distance[arr[i] - 'a'] != diff) return false;
            } else map.put(arr[i], i);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code should correctly check if the distances between the first and second occurrence of each character match the corresponding distances in the `distance` array.
