Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:

1. The provided code is attempting to calculate the maximum number of white tiles that can fit in a carpet with length `carpetLen`.
2. The code first sorts the `tiles` array based on the starting position of each tile.
3. It then uses two pointers (`x` and `y`) to keep track of the current range of tiles being considered.
4. The `count` variable keeps track of the number of white tiles in the current range.
5. The `maxCount` variable keeps track of the maximum number of white tiles encountered so far.
6. The code then enters a `while` loop, which terminates when either the `y` pointer reaches the end of the `tiles` array or when the `x` pointer surpasses the `y` pointer.
7. Inside the while loop, the code checks if the range of tiles (`end - start + 1`) is less than or equal to `carpetLen`.
8. If so, it updates `count` and `maxCount`, and increments `y`.
9. If not, it checks if the midpoint (`midDist`) of the range can fit in the carpet, and updates `maxCount` accordingly.
10. Then it decreases `count` and increments `x`.
11. The while loop continues until the termination condition is met.
12. Finally, the code returns `maxCount` as the maximum number of white tiles that can fit in the carpet.

However, the code contains a bug. In line 20, when accessing `tiles[y][-1]`, indexing `-1` will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

To fix this bug, we need to change `tiles[y][-1]` to `tiles[y][0]` since we want to access the starting position of the tile.

Updated Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumWhiteTiles(int[][] tiles, int carpetLen) {
        Arrays.sort(tiles, (a, b) -> {
            return a[0] - b[0];
        });
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        long maxCount = 0;
        long count = 0;

        while (y < tiles.length && x <= y) {
            long start = tiles[x][0];
            long end = tiles[y][1];

            if (end - start + 1 <= carpetLen) {
                count += tiles[y][1] - tiles
