The provided Java code calculates the number of combinations of three elements in the array 'arr' that sum up to the given target. The code loops through the array 'arr' and counts the occurrences of each number using the 'cnt' array. Then, it uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of three elements, calculates the sum, and checks if it matches the target. If it does, the code updates the result 'res' accordingly.

Upon reviewing the code, there are a few potential bugs:

1. The first potential bug is in the second 'for' loop condition:
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 101 && i <= target; i++) {
   ```
   The condition `i <= target` seems incorrect because it indicates that 'i' should not exceed the target value. However, the intention is to limit the iterations when 'i' exceeds the target, causing the subsequent elements to be larger than the target as well. To fix this, we should change the condition to `i < target`, so the loop terminates when 'i' reaches the target value itself.

2. The second potential bug is in the inner 'for' loop where 'j' is initialized as 'i' instead of 'i + 1'. This will lead to unnecessary iterations and duplicate calculations. To fix this, we should change the initialization of 'j' to `j = i + 1` so that 'j' starts from the next element after 'i'.

3. The third potential bug is in the calculation of the result 'res'. There are several cases covered by the 'if-else' statements to calculate the number of combinations, but there is a missing case when 'i', 'j', and 'k' are all different. In this case, the calculation should be `res += cnt[i] * cnt[j] * cnt[k];` To fix this, we add an extra 'else' statement to handle this case.

To summarize, the identified bugs are:
1. The condition in the second 'for' loop is incorrect.
2. The initialization of 'j' in the inner 'for' loop is incorrect.
3. The calculation of the result 'res' is incomplete.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumMulti(int[] arr, int target) {
        long[] cnt = new long[101];
        long res = 0;
        for (int i : arr) {
