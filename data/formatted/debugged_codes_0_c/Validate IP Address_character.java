The provided Java code is attempting to validate an IP address and return "IPv4" or "IPv6" based on the address format. 

To identify the bug, we need to review the regular expressions used for validating IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

The regular expression for validating IPv4 addresses seems to be correct. It checks for four groups of digits separated by periods (dots). Each group can range from 0 to 255. 

The regular expression for validating IPv6 addresses, however, seems to have a bug. It checks for eight groups of digits or lowercase/uppercase letters separated by colons (:). Each group can have 1 to 4 characters. But there is a closing parenthesis at the wrong position, causing a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we need to move the closing parenthesis one character to the right.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String validIPAddress(String queryIP) {
        String regexIpv4 = "(([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\\.){3}([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])";

        String regexIpv6 = "(([0-9a-fA-F]){1,4}\\:){7}(([0-9a-fA-F]){1,4})";

        if (queryIP.matches(regexIpv4))
            return "IPv4";
        else if (queryIP.matches(regexIpv6))
            return "IPv6";
        else
            return "Neither";
    }
}
```

Now, the regular expression for validating IPv6 addresses is fixed, and the code should work as intended.
