Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Error

Reasoning:
1. The code first checks if the length of the array is less than 1. If it is, the code returns false. This check is intended to handle an empty array case.
2. Then, the code sorts the array in ascending order.
3. The code initializes the variable 'diff' as the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted array.
4. The code then iterates through the array from the second element to the second-to-last element.
5. Inside the loop, the code checks if the difference between the next element and the current element is different from 'diff'. If it is, the code returns false.
6. Finally, if the loop completes without returning false, it means that all differences between consecutive elements are equal to 'diff', so the code returns true.

The bug in this code lies in the loop condition: 'i < arr.length - 1'. Since the loop starts from 1, the correct condition should be 'i < arr.length - 2' to iterate till the second-to-last element.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canMakeArithmeticProgression(int[] arr) {
        if (arr.length < 1)
            return false;
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int diff = arr[1] - arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length - 2; i++) { // Fix: change loop condition
            if (arr[i + 1] - arr[i] != diff) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
