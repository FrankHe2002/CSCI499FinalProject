Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Error

Reasoning:
- The code initializes an array `li` to store the last occurred index of each character in the string.
- The array `li` has a length of 26 (representing the 26 lowercase letters of the alphabet).
- The code iterates over the characters of the string `s` and accesses the corresponding index in `li` using the character's ASCII value.
- The bug occurs when trying to access `li` using an index that is greater than or equal to 26, which will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:
- The bug can be fixed by updating the line `if (li[idx] != null) dp[i - 1] = (curr - dp[li[idx] - 1] + mod) % mod;` to `if (li[idx] != null) dp[i] = (curr - dp[li[idx] - 1] + mod) % mod;`.
- This change ensures that the calculation of `dp[i]` is correct and does not result in an array index out of bounds error.
- The change is minimal and does not require reorganization or optimization of the code.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int distinctSubseqII(String s) {
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        Integer li[] = new Integer[26];
        int n = s.length();
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int curr = (2 * (dp[i - 1] % mod)) % mod;
            int idx = c[i - 1] - 'a';
            if (li[idx] != null) dp[i] = (curr - dp[li[idx] - 1] + mod) % mod;
            else dp[i] = curr;
            li[idx] = i;
        }
        return dp[n] - 1;
    }
}
