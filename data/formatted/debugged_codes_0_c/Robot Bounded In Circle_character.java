Bug Type: Syntax Error

Bug Description: The code has a syntax error in the if statement of the `isRobotBounded` method. The closing parenthesis is missing in the condition of the if statement.

Reasoning:
1. The code uses the `length` method on the `instructions` string object to check if the length is 0.
2. However, there is a syntax error in the if statement condition. The closing parenthesis is missing.
3. This error will cause a compilation error when trying to compile the code.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isRobotBounded(String instructions) {
        if (instructions.length() == 0) {
            return true;
        }

        // Rest of the code
    }
}
```

The fix is to add the missing closing parenthesis in the if statement condition.
