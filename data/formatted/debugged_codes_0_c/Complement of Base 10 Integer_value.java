The provided Java code aims to find the bitwise complement of a given integer `n`. It converts the given integer to a binary string, iterates over each character in the string, and replaces '1' with '0' and vice versa. Finally, it converts the modified binary string back to an integer and returns the result.

Upon reviewing the code, I have identified a potential bug:

1. The bug is related to the += operator for string concatenation inside the loop.
   - In Java, strings are immutable, which means that each time a string is modified, a new string object is created. This can lead to performance issues when concatenating strings in a loop.
   - It is more efficient to use a StringBuilder to collect the modified characters and then convert it to a string.
   
To fix the bug, we can use a StringBuilder to collect the modified characters and then convert it to a string. Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        String bin = Integer.toBinaryString(n);
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : bin.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '1')
                sb.append('0');
            else
                sb.append('1');
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(sb.toString(), 2);
    }
}
```

By using a StringBuilder, we eliminate the overhead of creating a new string object in each iteration of the loop, resulting in improved performance.
