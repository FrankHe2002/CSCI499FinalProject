The bug in the provided Java code is that it does not handle the case when multiple groups have the same maximum size. The current implementation counts the number of values in the map that have a count equal to the maximum count, which is c, but it does not track the groups themselves.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of groups that have the maximum count. Then, when iterating through the map, if we find a value that has a count equal to the maximum count, we increment the counter variable.

Here's the updated code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countLargestGroup(int n) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int x = sum(i);
            map.put(x, map.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int max = Collections.max(map.values());
        int c = 0;
        for (int i : map.values()) {
            if (i == max) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }

    public int sum(int g) {
        int summ = 0;
        while (g != 0) {
            int rem = g % 10;
            summ += rem;
            g /= 10;
        }
        return summ;
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, we correctly count the number of groups that have the largest size.
