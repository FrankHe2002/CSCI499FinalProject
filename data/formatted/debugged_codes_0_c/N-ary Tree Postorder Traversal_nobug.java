The provided code seems to be correct and does not contain any obvious bugs. 

On inspecting the code, it appears to be a postorder traversal of a tree structure represented by the `Node` class. The method `postorder` takes the root of the tree as an argument and calls the `addNodes` method. The `addNodes` method recursively adds all the child nodes of the current `Node` in a postorder manner by calling itself recursively for each child node and then adding the current node's value to the result list.

To further verify the correctness of the code, we can consider a few scenarios and try to execute the code for those scenarios to see if it produces the expected output.

Since there are no apparent bugs or issues in the code, we can conclude that the code is correct and will produce the expected output for any valid tree structure.
