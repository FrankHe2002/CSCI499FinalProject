Bug Type: Logic Error

At the beginning of the code, the method `imageSmoother` checks if the input `img` is null. However, the check is incorrect. Currently, the code checks if `img == null` rather than `img == null`. 

To fix this bug, the code needs to be changed from:
```java
if (img == null) {
```
to:
```java
if (img == null || img.length == 0 || img[0].length == 0) {
```

This fix will properly handle the case where `img` is null, empty, or contains an empty row.
