The code appears to have a bug in the `findMinLengths` method.

In this method, the `while` loop is used to find a subarray whose sum equals the target. However, there are several issues with the loop condition and variable updates that can cause unexpected behavior.

1. The loop condition `j != end` should be modified to `j != end && j >= 0 && j < arr.length`. This ensures that `j` stays within the valid index range.

2. After updating `i` and `j` inside the loop, the condition `while (sum <= target)` should be modified to `while (i != end && j != end && sum <= target)`. This ensures that `i` and `j` stay within the valid index range and prevents an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when accessing `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` after the loop exits.

3. The variable `dir` is supposed to control the direction of iteration (`start` to `end` or `end` to `start`). However, it is incorrectly calculated as `(int) Math.signum(end - start)`, which always evaluates to 1. To fix this, the calculation should be `(int) Math.signum(end - start + 1)`.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made to the code:

```java

class Solution {
    public int minSumOfLengths(int[] arr, int target) {
        int[] left = findMinLengths(0, arr.length, target, arr);
        int[] right = findMinLengths(arr.length - 1, 0, target, arr);

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++)
            left[i] = Math.min(left[i], left[i - 1]);

        for (int i = arr.length - 2; i >= 0; i--)
            right[i] = Math.min(right[i], right[i + 1]);

        int min = arr.length + 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++)
            min = Math.min(min, left[i] + right[i + 1]);

        return min == arr.length + 1 ? - 1 : min;
    }
