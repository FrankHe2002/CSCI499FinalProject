The provided Java code contains a bug in the line:

```
dist[r][c] = dist[x][y] + 1
```

The bug is a missing semicolon at the end of the line.

To fix the bug, we need to add a semicolon at the end of the line:

```java
dist[r][c] = dist[x][y] + 1;
```

This will ensure that the assignment statement is correctly terminated.
