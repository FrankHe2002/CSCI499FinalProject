The provided Java code aims to delete a node from a singly linked list. The code seems to have a bug when the node to be deleted is the last node in the linked list. 

To identify the bug, we need to understand the logic of the code. The code follows these steps to delete the given node:
1. Copy the value of the next node to the current node.
2. Update the next pointer of the current node to skip the next node.

However, the provided code does not handle the situation where the node to be deleted is the last node. In this case, when we access `node.next`, it will throw a `NullPointerException` since there is no next node.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the next node is null. If it is null, we can directly set the current node to null. 

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        if (node.next == null) {
            node = null; // Set the current node to null if it is the last node
            return;
        }
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code will handle the case where the node to be deleted is the last node.
