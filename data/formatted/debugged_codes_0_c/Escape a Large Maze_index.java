Bug type: Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning process:
1. The code is using the variable `move` inside the loop where it is iterating over the `blocked` array.
2. However, `move` is not defined anywhere in the code, so it will result in a compilation error.
3. To fix this, we need to replace `move` with `0` to access the correct element in each iteration of the loop.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 724 ms (Top 51.43%) | Memory: 118.9 MB (Top 56.19%)
class Solution {
    static final int limit = 1000000;//boundary check

    public boolean isEscapePossible(int[][] blocked, int[] source, int[] target) {
        Set<String> blocks = new HashSet<>();//HashSet to reduce the access time from O(N)-> O(1)

        for (int block[] : blocked)
            blocks.add(block[0] + "-" + block[1]);//putting the blocked node into the HashSet to access it at O(1)

        return bfsRange(source, target, blocks) && bfsRange(target, source, blocks);//sector division

        /*checking for both the case that the source is blocked or the target is blocked
         *if one of them is blocked we return false
         *since it is not practical to traverse each node, it will provide us with TLE
         */
    }

    /* Formula ::
     * shortest arc(displacement) of 1/4 sector of circel is a* 2^1/2
     * Area of the triangular sector is 1/2 * ( r{base} * r{height} )
     * Number of minimum shell to cover to move ahed of sector or boundary if possible = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 199 = 19900 (A.P)
     */

    public boolean bfsRange(int[] source, int[] target, Set<String> blocks) {//we simply do bsf to check the circular quadrant 1/4th boundary of the sector

        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();//visited hash set is so that we dont visit the visited cell again and the access time is O(1)
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();//as we use in BT

        q.offer(source);//adding the starting BFS node to the Queue

        visited.add(source[0] + "-" +
