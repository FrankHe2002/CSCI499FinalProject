The code appears to have a bug related to the index out of bounds exception. The bug occurs when the index variable exceeds the length of the arr array within the nested for-loop. This is because both conditions `index >= arr.length` and `val != arr[index]` are checked within the loop. 

To fix the bug, we need to rearrange the conditions within the nested for-loop to ensure that the index out of bounds check is performed before accessing the array element. Additionally, we can move `index++` outside the if statement to ensure that the index is always incremented. Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFormArray(int[] arr, int[][] pieces) {
        HashMap<Integer, int[]> hm = new HashMap();
        for (int[] list : pieces)
            hm.put(list[0], list);

        int index = 0;
        while (index < arr.length) {
            if (!hm.containsKey(arr[index]))
                return false;

            int[] list = hm.get(arr[index]);
            for (int val : list) {
                if (index >= arr.length || val != arr[index])
                    return false;
                index++;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

The bug was fixed by modifying the nested for-loop condition to check `index >= arr.length` first, and then checking `val != arr[index]`. Additionally, the `index++` statement was moved outside the if statement to ensure that the index is always incremented.
