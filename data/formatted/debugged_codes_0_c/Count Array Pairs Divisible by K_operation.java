Reviewing the provided Java code, there is a potential bug in the condition `(long) gcd1 * gcd2 % k == 0` inside the nested loop. 

To identify and fix the bug, we can follow these steps:

1. Understand the problem: The code aims to count the number of pairs in the given array `nums` such that the product of the pair is divisible by `k`.

2. Analysis: The code correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of each element in `nums` with `k`. It then iterates over the `hm` map and checks if the product of the `gcd` values in `hm` and `gcd1` is divisible by `k`. If true, it adds the corresponding count from `hm` to `ans`. Finally, it increments the count of `gcd1` in `hm`.

3. Bug identification: The bug potentially lies in the condition `(long) gcd1 * gcd2 % k == 0` inside the nested loop. Casting `gcd1` to `long` suggests the presence of a data type issue or a possible integer overflow when multiplying `gcd1` and `gcd2`.

4. Bug fix: To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to `(long) gcd1 * gcd2 % k == 0L` to ensure long arithmetic for the product calculation and comparing with 0.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public long countPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        long ans = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        for (int val : nums) {
            int gcd1 = gcd(val, k);

            for (int gcd2 : hm.keySet()) {
                if ((long) gcd1 * gcd2 % k == 0L) {
                    ans += hm.get(gcd2);
                }
            }

            hm.put(gcd1, hm.getOrDefault(gcd1, 0) + 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }

    public int gcd(int n1, int n2) {
        while (n1 - n2 != 0) {
            int rem = n1 % n2;
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = rem;
        }
        return n2;
    }
}
```

Note: The fix was made by appending `L` to the number 0 in the condition `(long) gcd1 * gcd2 % k == 0L
