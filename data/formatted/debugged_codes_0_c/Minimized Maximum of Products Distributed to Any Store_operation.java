The bug in the provided code is in the isItPossible() method. The bug is in the line:

```java
n -= Math.ceil(products / (x * 1.0));
```

The bug occurs because the calculation `products / (x * 1.0)` should be done with floating-point division, but it is currently using integer division. As a result, the value of n is not correctly updated, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line to:

```java
n -= Math.ceil(products / (double) x);
```

This change ensures that the division is performed with floating-point division, giving us the correct result for n.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix applied:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizedMaximum(int n, int[] quantities) {

        int lo = 1;
        int hi = (int) 1e5;

        int ans = -1;

        while (lo <= hi) {

            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;

            if (isItPossible(mid, quantities, n)) {
                ans = mid;
                hi = mid + 1;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private boolean isItPossible(int x, int[] quantities, int n) {

        // isItPossible to distribute <= x products to each of the n shops
        for (int i = 0; i < quantities.length; i++) {

            int products = quantities[i];

            n -= Math.ceil(products / (double) x);

            if (n < 0)     // means it requires more than n shops to distribute all products
                return false;
        }

        return true; // distributed all products to exactly n shops
    }
}
```
