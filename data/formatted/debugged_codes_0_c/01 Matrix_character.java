Bug type: Syntax bug

Reasoning process:
1. Read through the code and understand its purpose. The code appears to be using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to update the matrix values.
2. Scan the code for any syntax errors or inconsistencies.
3. Identify the following line that seems to have a syntax error:
   ```java
   if (p.y > 0 && visited[p.x][p.y - 1 == false)
   ```
   There is a missing closing parenthesis after `p.y - 1`. This code block is checking if the value of `visited[p.x][p.y - 1]` is equal to `false`.
4. Fix the syntax by adding the missing closing parenthesis:
   ```java
   if (p.y > 0 && visited[p.x][p.y - 1] == false)
   ```

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    //  BFS
// We add all 0 to the queue in the 0th level of the BFS. From there, every subsequent pair of indexes added would be 1 in the mat. THis way levels can represent the distance of a one from the closest 0 to it.
    boolean visited[][];

    // Could also convert the indexes to a single number by mat[0].length * i + j.
    class Pair {
        int x;
        int y;

        Pair(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }

    public int[][] updateMatrix(int[][] mat) {
        int level = 0;
        visited = new boolean[mat.length][mat[0].length];
        Queue<Pair> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        // Addition of all pairs in mat that have 0.
        for (int i = 0; i < mat.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < mat[0].length; j++) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 0) {
                    visited[i][j] = true;
                    q.add(new Pair(i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        while (q.size() > 0) {
            int size = q.size();
            while (size-- > 0) {
                Pair p = q.remove();
                mat[p.x][p.y] = level;
                if (p.x > 0 && visited[p.x - 1][p.y] == false) {
                    visited
