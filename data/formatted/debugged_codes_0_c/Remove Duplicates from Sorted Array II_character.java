The bug in the provided code is a syntax error. On line 15, there is a missing closing parenthesis for the "nums[index]" line. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of that line. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.0%) | Memory: 43.37 MB (Top 93.9%)

class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int index = 1;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }

            if (count <= 1) {
                nums[index] = nums[i];
                index++;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}
```

By adding the closing parenthesis, the syntax error is fixed and the code should now compile without any issues.
