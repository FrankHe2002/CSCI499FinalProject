Bug type: Off-by-one error

Explanation:
In the given code, the variable `totalTime` is initialized with the length of the word (`word.length()`). However, the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < word.length()`. This means that the first character of the word is not considered in calculating the `totalTime`.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the initialization of `totalTime` by decrementing the initial value by 1.

Revised code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToType(String word) {
        char prevChar = 'a';
        int totalTime = word.length() - 1; // Adjust initialization
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char currChar = word.charAt(i);
            int diff = Math.abs(currChar - prevChar);
            totalTime += Math.min(diff, 26 - diff);
            prevChar = currChar;
        }

        return totalTime;
    }
}
```
