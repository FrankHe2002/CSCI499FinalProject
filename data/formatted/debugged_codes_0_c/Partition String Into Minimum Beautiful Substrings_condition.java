Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
1. The code starts by calling the `backtrack` method with the given string `s` and index 0.
2. Inside the `backtrack` method, the condition `if (index != s.length())` is checking if the index is not equal to the length of the string. If this condition is true, it means there are still more characters to process, so the method should not return 0.
3. However, the condition is currently checking for inequality, which means it will return 0 only when the index is equal to the length of the string. This is incorrect and will cause the method to return 0 prematurely.
4. As a result, the backtrack method will always return 0, resulting in the final answer being incorrect.

Fix:
To fix this bug, the condition `if (index != s.length())` should be changed to `if (index == s.length())` to check if the index is equal to the length of the string. If this condition is true, it means all characters have been processed, so the method should return an appropriate value, such as -1.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumBeautifulSubstrings(String s) {
        return backtrack(s, 0);
    }

    private int backtrack(String s, int index) {
        if (index == s.length())
            return -1;

        int minPartitions = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = index + 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            String substring = s.substring(index, i);
            if (isValidBeautiful(substring)) {
                int partitions = backtrack(s, i);
                if (partitions != - 1)
                    minPartitions = Math.min(minPartitions, partitions + 1);
            }
        }

        return (minPartitions == Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? - 1 : minPartitions;
    }

    private boolean isValidBeautiful(String substring) {
        if (substring.startsWith("0"))
            return false;

        int decimalValue = Integer.parseInt(substring, 2);
        return isPowerOfFive(decimalValue);
    }

    private boolean isPowerOfFive(int num) {
        while (num % 5 == 0) {
            num /= 5;
        }
        return num == 1;
    }
}
```
