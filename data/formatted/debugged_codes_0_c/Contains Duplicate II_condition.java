The code is using a HashMap to keep track of each integer in the `nums` array and its index. If a value is already present in the HashMap and the difference between the current index and the stored index is greater than `k`, then it returns true.

One possible bug in this code is the condition inside the if statement:
```
(Math.abs(map.get(nums[i]) - i) > k)
```
This condition is checking if the absolute difference between the stored index and the current index is greater than `k`. However, the prompt is asking for the condition to be checked if it is less than or equal to `k`. This means that the comparison sign should be changed from `>` to `<=` in order to fix the bug.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(nums[i]) && (Math.abs(map.get(nums[i]) - i) <= k)) {
                return true;
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

The fix was performed by changing the comparison sign from `>` to `<=` in the if statement condition. This ensures that the code checks if the absolute difference between the stored index and the current index is less than or equal to `k`, as required by the prompt.
