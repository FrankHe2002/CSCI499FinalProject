After reviewing the code, I have identified the following bug:

1. The variable "boundary" in the if statement inside the for loop is undefined.

To fix this bug, I will initialize the variable "boundary" with the value of "i". This will ensure that the correct value is used in the if statement.

The modified code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(int[] obstacles) {
        int i = - 1, cur = 0, lisSize = - 1;
        int[] lis = new int[obstacles.length];
        int[] ans = new int[obstacles.length];

        for (int curHeight : obstacles) {
            int boundary = i;
            if (i == - 1 || lis[boundary] <= curHeight) {
                lis[++ i] = curHeight;
                lisSize = i;
            } else {
                lisSize = search(lis, 0, i, curHeight);
                lis[lisSize] = curHeight;
            }

            ans[cur++] = lisSize + 1;
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private int search(int[] nums, int start, int end, int target) {
        int left = start, right = end;
        int boundary = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                boundary = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return boundary;
    }
}
```

Note: The only change made was to initialize the "boundary" variable inside the for loop.
