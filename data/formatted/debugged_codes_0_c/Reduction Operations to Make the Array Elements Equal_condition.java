The bug in the provided Java code is in the for loop condition of the first for loop. The condition should be `i < nums.length` instead of `i > nums.length`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int reductionOperations(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> valMap = new TreeMap<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            valMap.put(nums[i], valMap.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);

        int mapSize = valMap.size();
        int opsCount = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : valMap.entrySet()) {
            opsCount += entry.getValue() * (-- mapSize);
        }
        return opsCount;
    }
}
```

Reasoning Process:
- In order to identify the bug, I looked at the loop conditions and how the variables were being used inside the code.
- I noticed that in the first for loop, the condition `i > nums.length` was incorrect because it would lead to the loop never executing as `i` is initialized as 0 and `nums.length` is always positive.
- The correct condition should be `i < nums.length` to ensure that the loop iterates through all the elements of `nums`.
- By comparing the buggy code with the correct code, we see that the only change needed is in the first for loop condition.
