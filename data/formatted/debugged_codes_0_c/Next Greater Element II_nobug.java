Bug Type: Array out of bounds error

Reasoning:
1. The provided code uses a stack to find the next greater element for each element in the input array.
2. The first for loop pushes all the elements of the input array into the stack, while the second for loop updates the elements of the input array based on the stack.
3. In the second for loop, the variable "num" is assigned the value of the current element being processed in the input array (nums[i]).
4. Inside the while loop, elements are popped from the stack until a greater element than the current element is found.
5. After the while loop, the current element in the input array is updated with the top element of the stack (if the stack is not empty), or with -1 (if the stack is empty).
6. Finally, the current element (stored in the variable "num") is pushed back into the stack.
7. The bug occurs when pushing the current element back into the stack using the variable "num" instead of nums[i].
   - This causes the elements to be pushed in reverse order into the stack, resulting in incorrect next greater elements.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line "s.push(num);" to "s.push(nums[i]);" in the second for loop.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            s.push(nums[i]);
        }
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int num = nums[i];
            while (!s.isEmpty() && s.peek() <= nums[i]) {
                s.pop();
            }
            nums[i] = s.empty() ? -1 : s.peek();
            s.push(nums[i]);
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```
