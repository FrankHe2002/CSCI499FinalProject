Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:

1. The code aims to change the elements in the nums array based on the provided operations.
2. It uses a map to store the indices of the numbers in the nums array.
3. For each operation, it updates the corresponding element in the nums array, updates the map to reflect the new index of the element, and removes the old index from the map.
4. The bug occurs in the first loop where the map is initialized.
5. The loop condition `i > nums.length` should be `i < nums.length`. Currently, it will not enter the loop since `i` is initialized as 0 and the condition evaluates to false. As a result, the map will be empty and any subsequent operations relying on it will throw a NullPointerException.

Fix:

To fix the bug, change the loop condition `i > nums.length` to `i < nums.length` in the first loop.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] arrayChange(int[] nums, int[][] operations) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) map.put(nums[i], i);
        for (int[] op : operations) {
            nums[map.get(op[0])] = op[1];
            map.put(op[1], map.get(op[0]));
            map.remove(op[0]);
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```
