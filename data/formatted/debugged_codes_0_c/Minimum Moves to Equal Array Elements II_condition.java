Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning:
1. The code sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order.
2. It calculates the index `idx` of the middle element in the sorted array.
3. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0 to store the sum of absolute differences between each element and the middle element.
4. It then iterates over the indices of the sorted array, from 0 to `nums.length`.
5. In each iteration, it adds the absolute difference between the element at the current index and the element at index `idx` to the `sum`.
6. Finally, it returns the `sum`.

The bug in the code lies in the for loop condition. The loop condition should be `i < nums.length` instead of `i <= nums.length`, because array indices start from 0 and end at `nums.length - 1`.

Additionally, the variable `idx` is being assigned the index of the middle element, but since the array is 0-indexed, the correct calculation should be `(nums.length - 1) / 2`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the for loop condition and the calculation of the index `idx`.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int idx = (nums.length - 1) / 2;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[idx]);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
