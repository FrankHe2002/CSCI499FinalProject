Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is trying to build a string representation for an expression that divides the numbers in the array.
2. Looking at the code, the process involves appending numbers and '/' characters to a string builder.
3. There is an issue with the for loop that appends the '/' character between numbers.
4. The for loop is missing opening curly braces '{' and closing curly braces '}' to define the block of code to be executed in each iteration of the loop.
5. This results in a syntax error in the code.

Fix:
1. Add opening curly brace '{' after the for loop declaration and condition.
2. Add closing curly brace '}' after the last statement in the for loop block.
