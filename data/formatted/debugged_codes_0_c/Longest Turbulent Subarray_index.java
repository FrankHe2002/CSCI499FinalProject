Upon reviewing the code, one bug was identified. 

Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes `int diff = arr[l] - arr[2];` where `l = 0`.
2. However, in the subsequent if-else block, `l` and `r` are re-assigned values based on `diff`.
3. If `diff` is equal to 0, `l` and `r` are both set to 1.
4. This means that `arr[2]` is accessed, which will result in an Array Index Out of Bounds Exception since the array `arr` may not have at least 3 elements.

To fix this bug and improve the code, we can make the following minimal changes:

- Change `int diff = arr[l] - arr[2];` to `int diff = arr[l] - arr[r];`

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTurbulenceSize(int[] arr) {
        if (arr.length == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int l = 0, r = 1;
        int diff = arr[l] - arr[r]; // Fixed line, changed arr[2] to arr[r]
        int max;
        if (diff == 0) {
            l = 1;
            r = 1;
            max = 1;
        } else {
            l = 0;
            r = 1;
            max = 2;
        }
        for (int i = 1; r < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            int nextdiff = arr[i] - arr[i + 1];
            if (diff < 0) {
                if (nextdiff > 0) {
                    r++;
                } else if (nextdiff == 0) {
                    l = i + 1;
                    r = i + 1;
                } else {
                    l = i;
                    r = i + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (nextdiff < 0) {
                    r++;
                } else if (nextdiff == 0) {
                    l = i + 1;
                    r = i + 1;
                } else {
                    l = i;
                    r = i + 1;
                }
            }
            diff = nextdiff;
            max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
        }
