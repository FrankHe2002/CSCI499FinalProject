The bug in the provided code is in the calculation of the `mid` variable. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the calculation of `mid` from `int mid = s + (e - s) / 1;` to `int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;`. The reason is that we want to find the middle value between `s` and `e`, so we divide the difference between them by 2.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = n;

        while (s < e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;

            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                e = mid;
            } else {
                s = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return e;
    }
}
```

By changing the division value from 1 to 2, we ensure that the middle value is calculated correctly.
