The code has a syntax error in the method signature. The closing parenthesis ")" is missing after the "position" parameter in the method declaration. 

To fix the bug, the missing closing parenthesis ")" needs to be added after "position" in the method signature.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostToMoveChips(int[] position) {
        int even = 0;
        int odd = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
            if (position[i] % 2 == 0) {
                even++;
            } else {
                odd++;
            }
        }
        return Math.min(even, odd);
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by adding the missing closing parenthesis in the method signature.
