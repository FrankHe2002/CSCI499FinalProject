The code seems to have a missing closing parenthesis ')' in the method signature declaration of `findMiddleIndex` which is causing a syntax error.

To fix this, we need to add the missing closing parenthesis ')' in the method signature.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMiddleIndex(int[] nums) {

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int rsum = 0;
            int lsum = 0;

            for (int k = 0; k < i; k++) lsum += nums[k];
            for (int k = i + 1; k < nums.length; k++) rsum += nums[k];

            if (lsum == rsum) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1;

    }
}
```

The bug in the code was identified by checking for any syntax errors. To fix it, we added the missing closing parenthesis ')' in the method signature. No additional changes were needed.
