The bug in the provided Java code is in the `mctFromLeafValues` method. Specifically, the line `sum += cleanUpStack(17, stack);` should be removed from the code.

Reasoning process:

1. Understanding the code: The `mctFromLeafValues` method calculates the minimum cost to form a binary search tree from a given array of leaf values. It uses a stack to keep track of the leaf values in descending order.

2. Analyzing the bug: The line `sum += cleanUpStack(17, stack);` is unnecessary and should be removed. It adds an extra value (17) to the stack and calculates additional costs that should not be included in the final result.

3. Fixing the bug: Remove the line `sum += cleanUpStack(17, stack);` from the code.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int mctFromLeafValues(int[] arr) {

        int sum = 0;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            sum += cleanUpStack(num, stack);
        }

        return sum;
    }

    private int cleanUpStack(int target, Stack<Integer> stack) {
        int last = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while (! stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= target) {
            int cur = stack.pop();
            sum += last * cur;
            last = cur;
        }
        sum += target * last;
        stack.push(target);
        return sum;
    }
}
```
