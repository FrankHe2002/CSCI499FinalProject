The bug in the given code is in the while loop where `minCost` is calculated. The line `minCost += cost[-1] + cost[index - 1];` should be replaced with `minCost += cost[index] + cost[index - 1];`. 

Reasoning:
1. In the given code, `minCost` is initialized as 0 and `index` is initialized as `cost.length - 1`.
2. The `cost` array is sorted in ascending order.
3. The while loop is executed as long as `index` is greater than 1. This means there are at least 3 items remaining in the `cost` array.
4. In each iteration of the loop, `minCost` is incremented by the sum of the second largest (`cost[index - 1]`) and the largest (`cost[-1]`) elements in the remaining part of the `cost` array.
5. The `index` is then decremented by 3, to skip the pair that has been added (with the third element getting a discount).

Fix:
Replace the line `minCost += cost[-1] + cost[index - 1];` with `minCost += cost[index] + cost[index - 1];`.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 83.40%) | Memory: 42.5 MB (Top 73.57%)
class Solution {
    /**
     * Algorithm
     * 1. Sort the cost array.
     * 2. In a loop, start from the back and buy items n, n-1 to get n-2 for free.
     * 3. Decrement the position by 3 and continue. stop when you reach 1.
     * 4. From 1, add the remaining 1 or 2 items.

    public int minimumCost(int[] cost) {
        int minCost = 0;
        int index = cost.length - 1;
        Arrays.sort(cost);
        // add items in pairs of 2, the 3rd one getting it for free.
        while (index > 1) {
            minCost += cost[index] + cost[index - 1];
            index -= 3;
        }
        // add the remaining 1, 2 items, if any.
        while (index >= 0) {
            minCost += cost[index--];
        }
        return minCost;
    }
}
