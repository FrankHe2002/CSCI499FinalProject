There is a bug in the code. 

In the final line of the while loop, `ans` is divided by 1 using the `/=` operator. This operation does not modify the value of `ans`. Therefore, it seems like this line of code is unnecessary and does not serve any purpose in the context of the code.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the line `ans /= 1;`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinFibonacciNumbers(int k) {
        int ans = 0;

        while (k > 0) {
            int fib2prev = 1;
            int fib1prev = 1;
            while (fib1prev <= k) {
                int temp = fib2prev + fib1prev;
                fib2prev = fib1prev;
                fib1prev = temp;
            }
            k -= fib2prev;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that the code is correct and removes the unnecessary line of code that was not contributing to the functionality of the program.
