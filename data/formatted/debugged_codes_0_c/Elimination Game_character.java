There is a syntax error in the provided Java code. Let's review the code and identify the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int head = 1;
        int remain = n;
        boolean left = true;
        int step = 1;

        while (remain > 1) 
            if (left || remain % 2 == 1) {
                head = head + step;
            }
            remain /= 2;
            step *= 2;
            left = !left;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

Upon reviewing the code, we can see that the while loop does not have braces around the body, which means that only the first statement after the while loop condition is considered as part of the loop. In this case, the `if` statement and the following 3 lines are not part of the loop and will always execute once.

To fix this issue, we need to add braces `{ }` around the body of the while loop to ensure that the `if` statement and the following lines are executed as part of the loop.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int head = 1;
        int remain = n;
        boolean left = true;
        int step = 1;

        while (remain > 1) {
            if (left || remain % 2 == 1) {
                head = head + step;
            }
            remain /= 2;
            step *= 2;
            left = !left;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

The bug in the code has been fixed by adding curly braces `{ }` around the body of the while loop.
