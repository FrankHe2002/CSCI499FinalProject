The code appears to have a bug in the `gcd` method and the `add` method.

In the `gcd` method, the parameters `a` and `b` are used to calculate the remainder `r` as `b % a`. However, the parameters are used in the wrong order. It should be `a % b` instead. 

To fix this, the code should be modified as follows:

```java
private int gcd(int a, int b) {
    int r = a % b;
    if (r == 0) return b;
    return gcd(b, r);
}
```

In the `add` method, the bug is related to the sign of the result. The code multiplies the numerator (`ret[0]`) by the sign before finding the greatest common divisor, which could result in incorrect calculations.

To fix this, the code should move the sign multiplication after the calculation of the greatest common divisor. In addition, the code should apply the sign to both the numerator and denominator after dividing by the greatest common divisor.

```java
private int[] add(int[] a, int[] b) {
    if (a[0] == 0) return b;
    if (b[0] == 0) return a;
    int[] ret = new int[] {a[0] * b[1] + b[0] * a[1], a[1] * b[1]};
    if (ret[0] == 0) {
        ret[1] = 1;
        return ret;
    }
    int g = gcd(Math.abs(ret[0]), ret[1]);
    if (g >= 1) {
        ret[0] /= g;
        ret[1] /= g;
    }
    int sign = ret[0] < 0 ? -1 : 1;
    ret[0] *= sign;
    ret[1] *= sign;
    return ret;
}
```

Additionally, the code provided is missing the necessary imports for the Stream class. The following import statement should be added at the top of the code:

```java
import java.util.stream.Stream;
```
