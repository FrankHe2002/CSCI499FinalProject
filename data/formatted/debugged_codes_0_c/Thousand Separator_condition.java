Bug type: logical error

Reasoning process:

1. The code is trying to add a thousand separator (".") to the input number by inserting it every three digits from right to left.
2. The code initializes an index variable to the position of the thousand separator after the first three digits.
3. The code enters a while loop that will execute as long as the index is less than 1.
4. The code inserts the thousand separator at the current index and then decreases the index by 3.
5. However, there is a mistake in the while loop condition. Since the initial value of the index is already the position of the thousand separator, the loop condition should be `index > 0` instead of `index < 1`.
6. Therefore, the while loop does not execute and the code returns the input string without any modifications.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String thousandSeparator(int n) {

        StringBuffer str = new StringBuffer(Integer.toString(n));
        int index = str.length() - 3;

        while (index > 0) {
            str.insert(index, '.');
            index = index - 3;
        }

        return str.toString();
    }
}
```
