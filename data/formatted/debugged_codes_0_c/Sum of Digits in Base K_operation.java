The code appears to be calculating the sum of the digits of a number in base `k`. The loop iterates until `n` becomes 0 and for each iteration, the remainder (`n % k`) is added to `res` and `n` is divided by `k` (`n /= k`).

Upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any logical or syntactical bugs. The code seems to be correct and I don't see any issues with the provided solution. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits in base `k`.

Hence, there is no bug to fix in the provided code.
