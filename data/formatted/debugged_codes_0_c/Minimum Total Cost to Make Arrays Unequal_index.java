Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The goal of the code is to find the minimum total cost based on certain conditions.
2. The code iterates through `nums1` and checks if `nums1[2] == nums2[i]`.
3. If the condition is true, the code adds `nums1[i]` to the map with a value of `1` or increments the existing value by `1`.
4. The code also adds `i` to the result `res`.
5. After iterating through `nums1`, the code calculates `val`, which is the key with the maximum value in the map, and `size`, which is the sum of all values in the map.
6. Then, the code iterates through `nums1` again and performs certain operations based on conditions.
7. Finally, the code returns a value based on another condition.

Bug:
The bug in the code is in the first for loop where it checks `nums1[2] == nums2[i]`. It should be checking `nums1[i] == nums2[i]` instead. This is because it wants to check if the corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are equal, not if the third element in `nums1` is equal to any element in `nums2`.

Fix:
Change the condition in the first for loop from `nums1[2] == nums2[i]` to `nums1[i] == nums2[i]`.
