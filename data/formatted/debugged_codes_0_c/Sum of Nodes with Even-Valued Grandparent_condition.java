The bug in the provided code is in the `dfs` function. Specifically, on this line:

```java
if (grandParent == null && grandParent.val % 2 == 0) {
```

This condition checks if the `grandParent` is null and then tries to access its `val` property. However, this will cause a `NullPointerException` because `grandParent` is null.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to check if `parent` is null and then access its `val` property. The fixed code will look like this:

```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;

    public int sumEvenGrandparent(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, null, null);
        return sum;
    }

    void dfs(TreeNode current, TreeNode parent, TreeNode grandParent) {
        if (current == null) return; // base case 
        if (parent != null && parent.val % 2 == 0) {
            sum += current.val;
        }
        //cur->cur.left ||cur.right , parent=cur,grandPrarent=parent
        dfs(current.left, current, parent);
        dfs(current.right, current, parent);
    }
}
```

Now the code will correctly check if the parent is null and then access its `val` property.
