Code Explanation:
1. The code calculates the number of days it takes for a person to visit all the rooms in a given pattern.
2. It uses an array 'nextVisit' to store the index of the next room to be visited for each room.
3. It initializes an array 'dp' of type 'long' with the same length as 'nextVisit' to store the number of days taken to visit each room.
4. The code then iterates over each room starting from the second room (index 1) and calculates the number of days taken to visit that room.
5. There seems to be a bug on line 9 of the code, where `dp[i]` is calculated. The formula used to calculate `dp[i]` is incorrect.

Bug Explanation:
- The bug lies in the formula used to calculate `dp[i]` on line 9.
- The formula tries to calculate the number of days taken to visit the current room based on the number of days taken to visit the previous room(s).
- However, the part `dp[i - 1] - dp[nextVisit[i + 1]]` is incorrect. It is trying to subtract the number of days taken to visit 'nextVisit[i + 1]' room, which is out of bounds.
- Additionally, the part `dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 1] - dp[nextVisit[i + 1]]` is also incorrect, as it should only be `dp[i - 1] + 2`.
- This bug will result in incorrect calculations for `dp[i]` and ultimately lead to a wrong answer.

Code Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the formula used to calculate `dp[i]` on line 9. Additionally, we should also change the type of `dp` array from `long` to `int` as the return type of the method is `int`. The modified code with the bug fix is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstDayBeenInAllRooms(int[] nextVisit) {
        int rooms = nextVisit.length;
        int dp[] = new int[rooms];
        int mod = (int) (1e9) + 7;
        for (int i = 1; i < rooms; i++) {
            if (nextVisit[i - 1] == i - 1)
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2) % mod;
            else
