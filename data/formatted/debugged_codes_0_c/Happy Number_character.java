Upon reviewing the code, it appears that there is a bug in the implementation.

The bug is in the while loop condition `while (hset.add(n))`. The purpose of this loop is to iterate until the number `n` is already present in the hash set. However, the condition `hset.add(n)` actually adds `n` to the hash set before checking if it was present or not. Therefore, the while loop will never iterate more than once because `add(n)` will always return false after the first iteration.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the while loop condition to check if the number `n` is already present in the hash set without adding it. We can do this by using the `contains()` method of the HashSet class.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix applied:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 47.06% | Memory: 41.5 MB (Top 32.65%)
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> hset = new HashSet<Integer>();
        while (!hset.contains(n)) {
            hset.add(n);
            int total = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                total += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
                n /= 10;
            }
            if (total == 1)
                return true;
            else
                n = total;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that the while loop iterates until a cycle is detected.
