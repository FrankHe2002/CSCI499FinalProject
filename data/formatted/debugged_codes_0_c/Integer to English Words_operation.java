The bug in the code is in the line:

`return sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) == ' ' ? sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() % 1) : sb;`

First, the use of `% 1` seems incorrect as it is expected to return 0. This may have been intended to be `sb.length() - 1`.

Second, the use of `deleteCharAt()` with `sb.length() - 1` will delete the last character of `sb`, regardless of whether it is a space or not. Thus, it will delete the last digit instead of trimming the trailing space. 

To fix the bug, we can use the `trim()` method to remove the trailing space.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {

    private static final int[] INT_NUMBERS = {
            1_000_000_000, 1_000_000, 1000, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    private static final String[] STRING_NUMBERS = {
            "Billion", "Million", "Thousand", "Hundred", "Ninety", "Eighty", "Seventy", "Sixty", "Fifty", "Forty", "Thirty", "Twenty",
            "Nineteen", "Eighteen", "Seventeen", "Sixteen", "Fifteen", "Fourteen", "Thirteen", "Twelve", "Eleven", "Ten",
            "Nine", "Eight", "Seven", "Six", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One"};

    public String numberToWords(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return "Zero";
        return numberToWordsHelper(num).toString().trim();
    }

    private StringBuilder numberToWordsHelper(int num) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        if (num == 0) return sb;
        for (int i = 0; i < INT_NUMBERS.length; i++) {
            if (num >= INT_NUMBERS[i]) {
                if (num >= 100) {
