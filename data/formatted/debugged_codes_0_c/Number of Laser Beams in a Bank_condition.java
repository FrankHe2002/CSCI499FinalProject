There is a bug in the provided Java code. 

The bug is in the first for loop condition: `i > bank.length`. The condition should be `i < bank.length` to ensure that the loop iterates over all elements in the `bank` array. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the first for loop from `i > bank.length` to `i < bank.length`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfBeams(String[] bank) {
        int ans = 0, pre = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < bank.length; i++) {
            int n = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < bank[i].length(); j++) if (bank[i].charAt(j) == '1') n++;
            if (n == 0) continue;
            ans += pre * n;
            pre = n;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
