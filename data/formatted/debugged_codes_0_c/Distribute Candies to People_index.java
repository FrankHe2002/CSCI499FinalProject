There is a logic bug in the provided code. The bug occurs when trying to distribute the candies to each person in a round-robin fashion. 

The bug is in this line: `a[i + 2] += k;`. 

In each iteration of the for loop, `i` represents the current person, but when trying to distribute the candies, `a[i + 2]` should be updated instead of `a[i]`. This means that the current person's candies should be added to the next person's candies.

To fix the bug, we can change the line `a[i + 2] += k;` to `a[i] += k;`.

The corrected code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {
        int n = num_people;
        int[] a = new int[n];
        int k = 1;
        while (candies > 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (candies >= k) {
                    a[i] += k;
                    candies -= k;
                    k++;
                } else {
                    a[i] += candies;
                    candies = 0;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
