Bug Type: StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning Process:
1. The code splits the input text into an array of words using the space character as a delimiter.
2. It then converts each word to lowercase using the toLowerCase() method.
3. The array of words is sorted based on the length of each word.
4. The first word in the sorted array is capitalized by taking the first character, converting it to uppercase, and concatenating it with the rest of the word.
5. Finally, the sorted array of words is joined back together into a single string using the space character as a separator.

The bug can be identified in the line: `words[0] = Character.toUpperCase(words[0].charAt(0)) + words[0].substring(1);`
This line attempts to capitalize the first word in the sorted array, but it does not check if the first word exists.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the array of words is not empty before trying to capitalize the first word. 

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String arrangeWords(String text) {
        String[] words = text.split(" ");
        if (words.length > 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
                words[i] = words[i].toLowerCase();
            }
            Arrays.sort(words, (s, t) -> s.length() - t.length());
            words[0] = Character.toUpperCase(words[0].charAt(0)) + words[0].substring(1);
        }
        return String.join(" ", words);
    }
}
```
