The apparent bug in the provided Java code is that the flag `flag` is used to prematurely terminate the recursion, which could result in incorrect return values. The flag is set to `true` when the frog successfully completes the jump and reaches the last stone. However, there might be multiple valid paths for the frog to reach the last stone, and setting the flag to true even once can cause the recursion to terminate prematurely.

To fix this bug, the flag should be removed, and the return statement should be modified to correctly handle the termination condition. 

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canCross(int[] stones) {
        int i = 0; // starting stone
        int k = 1; // starting jump
        return canBeCrossed(stones, k, i);
    }

    public boolean canBeCrossed(int[] stones, int k, int i) {
        if (stones[i] + k == stones[stones.length - 1]) { // If frog do 'k' jump from current stone lands on last stones, return true
            return true;
        }
        
        // If frog do 'k' jump from current stone crosses last stone or not able to reach next stone
        // return false
        if (stones[i] + k > stones[stones.length - 1] || stones[i] + k < stones[i + 1]) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int temp = i + 1; // identify which next stone frog can reach
        // Find until which stone frog can jump
        // So jump from current stone not greater than next possible stone, exit loop
        while (stones[i] + k >= stones[temp]) {
            temp++;
        }
        
        // If next possible stone reached
        // then do all possible jumps from this stone
        // the current stone is 'temp'
        // possible jumps are 'k-1', k, 'k+1'
        if (stones[i] + k == stones[temp]) {
            return (canBeCrossed(stones, k + 1, temp) || canBeCrossed(stones, k, temp) || canBeCrossed(stones, k - 1, temp));
        } else {
            // If next possible stone not reached means jump from the current stone can't reach any stone
            // hence return false
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
