Bug type: Arithmetic Overflow

Reasoning process:
1. The code checks for a specific case where the dividend is the minimum possible value and the divisor is -1. In this case, the code correctly returns `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to avoid an integer overflow. 
2. The code then calculates the sign of the result by comparing the signs of the dividend and divisor. This step is correct.
3. The code takes the absolute values of dividend and divisor. This step is correct.
4. The code then enters a loop where it subtracts the divisor from the dividend repeatedly until the difference becomes negative.
5. Inside the loop, the code counts the number of times the divisor can be shifted left while still being less than or equal to the dividend. This is done in the inner while loop.
6. The code adds `1 << count` to the result and subtracts `divisor << count` from the dividend.

The bug in the code occurs in step 6. The code incorrectly performs a left shift on the divisor by `count` number of times. This leads to an arithmetic overflow if `count` is greater than the number of bits in an integer. This can happen if the divisor is a large power of 2.

To fix the bug, we need to limit the value of `count` to ensure that the left shift operation does not result in an overflow. We can add an additional condition in the inner while loop to break the loop if `count` reaches a certain limit. The limit can be the number of bits in an integer (32 for a 32-bit integer).

Fixed Java code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        if (dividend == 1 << 31 && divisor == - 1) {
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        boolean sign = (dividend >= 0) == (divisor >= 0) ? true : false;

        dividend = Math.abs(dividend);
        divisor = Math.abs(divisor);

        int result = 0;
        while (dividend - divisor >= 0) {
            int count = 0;
            while (dividend - (divisor << 1 << count) >= 0 && count < 31) {
                count++;
            }
            result += 1 << count;
            dividend -= divisor << count;
        }
        return sign ? result : - result;
    }
}
```
