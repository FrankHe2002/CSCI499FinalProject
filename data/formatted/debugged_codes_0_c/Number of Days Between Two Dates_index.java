The bug in the provided Java code is in the `daysBetweenDates` method. Specifically, the bug lies in the parameters passed to the `daysFrom1971` method, where `d1[years]` should be `d1[0]`. 

To identify this bug, we need to carefully analyze the code and understand its logic. 

1. In the `daysBetweenDates` method, the input dates are split into arrays `d1` and `d2` using the "-" delimiter. So, we can assume that the input dates are in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
2. Then, the code calculates the number of days between the provided dates by subtracting the number of days from 1971 for `date2` from the number of days from 1971 for `date1`. 
3. The `daysFrom1971` method is used to calculate the number of days from 1971 for a given date. 
4. In the `daysFrom1971` method, the code calculates the total days by adding the number of days for each year, month, and day.
5. The code uses a switch statement to sum the number of days for each month based on the provided month value.
6. Finally, the total number of days is returned.

Now, let's focus on the bug. In the `daysBetweenDates` method, the code tries to calculate the number of days from 1971 for `date1` and `date2` using the `daysFrom1971` method. However, there is an indexing mistake in accessing the year value from the array `d1`. Instead of `d1[years]`, it should be `d1[0]`.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `d1[years]` with `d1[0]` in the return statement of the `daysBetweenDates` method. Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int daysBetweenDates(String date1, String date2) {
        String[] d1 = date1.split("-");
        String[] d2 = date2.split("-");
        return (int) Math.abs(
                daysFrom1971(Integer.parseInt(d1[0]), Integer.parseInt(d1[1]), Integer.parseInt(d1[2]))
                        - daysFrom1971(Integer.parseInt(d2[0]), Integer.parseInt(d2[1]), Integer.parseInt(d2[2])));
    }

    private int daysFrom1971(int year, int
