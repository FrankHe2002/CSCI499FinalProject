The bug in the provided code lies in the match() method. The condition "diff == expectedDiff" in the return statement is incorrect. It should be "diff <= expectedDiff" because we want to check if the difference between the characters is less than or equal to the expected difference.

To fix the bug, we need to change the return statement in the match() method to "return diff <= expectedDiff".

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class MagicDictionary {
    private String[] dictionary;

    public MagicDictionary() {
    }

    public void buildDict(String[] dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = dictionary;
    }

    public boolean search(String searchWord) {
        for (String dictWord : this.dictionary) {
            if (this.match(searchWord, dictWord, 1))
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    private boolean match(String s, String t, int expectedDiff) {
        if (s.length() != t.length())
            return false;

        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != t.charAt(i))
                diff++;
            if (diff > expectedDiff)
                return false;
        }

        return diff <= expectedDiff;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by changing the return statement in the match() method. Now, when the match() method is called in the search() method, it will return the correct result.
