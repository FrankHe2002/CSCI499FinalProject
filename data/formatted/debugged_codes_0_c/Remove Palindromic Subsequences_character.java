Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
- The code checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends (from left to right and from right to left) until the middle of the string.
- If a mismatch is found, it immediately returns '2' indicating that it is not a palindrome.
- However, if the input string is empty ("") or a palindrome, the code will never enter the while loop and it will return '0', which is incorrect. The correct return value should be '1' in these cases.

Fix:
- Add a condition at the beginning of the method to check if the string is empty. If it is, return '0' indicating that the string is empty.
- Return '1' at the end of the method after the while loop since the code will only reach that point if the string is either empty or a palindrome.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        if (s.isEmpty()) { // Check if the string is empty
            return 0;
        }
        
        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left++) != s.charAt(right--)) {
                return 2;
            }
        }
        return 1; // Return 1 if the string is empty or a palindrome
    }
}
```
