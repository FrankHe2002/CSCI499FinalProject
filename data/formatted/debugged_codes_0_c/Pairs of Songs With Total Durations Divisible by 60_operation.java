Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is supposed to count the number of pairs in the 'time' array whose sum is divisible by 60.
2. The code initializes an array 'hm' with a size of 61 to store the count of remainders.
3. The code then calculates the remainders of each element in 'time' when divided by 60.
4. It should update the count of each remainder in the 'hm' array.
5. The code checks if there exists a remainder in 'hm' which, when added to the current remainder, equals 60. If so, it adds the count of such remainders to the 'res' variable.
6. Finally, the code returns the 'res' variable as the result.

Bug:
The line `res = res + hm[60 + time[i]]` should be `res = res + hm[60 - time[i]]`.

Fix:
Change `hm[60 + time[i]]` to `hm[60 - time[i]]`.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int[] hm = new int[61];
        int n = time.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            time[i] = time[i] % 60;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (hm[60 - time[i]] != 0)
                res = res + hm[60 - time[i]];
            if (time[i] == 0)
                hm[60] += 1;
            else
                hm[time[i]] += 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

This fix will correctly count the number of pairs whose sum is divisible by 60.
