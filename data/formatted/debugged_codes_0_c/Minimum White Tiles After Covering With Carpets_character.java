Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to find the minimum sum of white tiles in a given floor while placing a certain number of carpets of a given length.
2. The code uses a recursive function "helper" to solve the problem.
3. The base cases for the helper function seem to be correct. If the position is greater than or equal to the length of the floor, or if there are no more carpets left to place, the function should return 0.
4. However, the condition "floor.length() - position <= numCarpets * carpetLen" seems to be incorrect. This condition is trying to check if there are enough tiles left to place the remaining carpets, but it should be checking if there are enough tiles left to place the remaining carpets * carpetLen. The current condition may return false even if there are enough tiles, leading to incorrect solutions.
5. Additionally, the key used to store the results in the cache is incorrect. It should include the carpetLen as well since different carpet lengths can give different results.
6. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition "floor.length() - position <= numCarpets * carpetLen" to "floor.length() - position >= numCarpets * carpetLen".
7. We also need to update the key used for storing results in the cache to include the carpetLen.

Fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    Map<String, Integer> cache;

    public int minimumWhiteTiles(String floor, int numCarpets, int carpetLen) {
        cache = new HashMap<>();
        return helper(floor, 0, numCarpets, carpetLen);
    }

    public int helper(String floor, int position, int numCarpets, int carpetLen) {
        if (position >= floor.length()) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (floor.length() - position < numCarpets * carpetLen) {
            return 0;
        }

        String key = position + ", " + numCarpets + ", " + carpetLen;
        if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
            return cache.get(key);
        }

        if (numCarpets == 0) {
            int output = floor.charAt(position) - '0' + helper(floor, position + 1, 0, carpetLen);

            cache.put(key, output);
            return output;
        }

        int output = Math.min
