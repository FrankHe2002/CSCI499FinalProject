Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The code aims to remove a specific digit from a given number and return the largest resulting number. However, the code is not removing the digit correctly and the sorting logic is incorrect.

Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to make the following changes:
1. Initialize the 'digits' list as a list of Integers instead of Strings.
2. Convert the given 'number' to an integer.
3. Iterate through each digit in the number by converting it to a string.
4. If the digit is equal to the given 'digit' character, remove it from the number by dividing it by 10 and multiplying by 10.
5. Add the modified number to the 'digits' list.
6. Sort the 'digits' list in descending order.
7. Convert the largest number in the 'digits' list back to a string.
8. Return the string.

Updated Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms | Memory: 38.6 MB
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String removeDigit(String number, char digit) {
        List<Integer> digits = new ArrayList<>();
        int num = Integer.parseInt(number);
        while(num > 0) {
            int mod = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
            if(Character.getNumericValue(digit) != mod)
                digits.add(num * 10 + mod);
        }
        Collections.sort(digits, Collections.reverseOrder());
        return digits.get(0).toString();
    }
}
```

The code has been modified to ensure correct removal of the digit and to sort the digits list in descending order. Additionally, unnecessary string operations have been eliminated by working with integers directly.
