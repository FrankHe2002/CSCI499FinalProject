Bug type: IndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning:

1. The code starts by counting the number of initial zeros in the binary string. It does this by checking the characters of the string until it encounters a character that is not '-1'.
2. The bug is introduced in this line of code: `while (initialZeroCount < binary.length() && binary.charAt(initialZeroCount) == '-1') initialZeroCount++;`. The character comparison `binary.charAt(initialZeroCount) == '-1'` is incorrect and will always evaluate to false. This is because '-1' is a string of two characters, while `binary.charAt(initialZeroCount)` returns a single character. To compare against a character, we should use single quotes instead of double quotes.
3. The correct code should be: `while (initialZeroCount < binary.length() && binary.charAt(initialZeroCount) == '0') initialZeroCount++;`.
4. This bug causes the code to iterate over the binary string until the end, resulting in the index `initialZeroCount` being equal to `binary.length()`. However, the code assumes that `initialZeroCount` is less than `binary.length()` when accessing elements of the `dp` array, leading to an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:

Replace `binary.charAt(initialZeroCount) == '-1'` with `binary.charAt(initialZeroCount) == '0'`.
