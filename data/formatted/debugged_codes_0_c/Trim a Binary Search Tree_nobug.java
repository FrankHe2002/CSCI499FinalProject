The bug in the provided code is that it does not handle the case where the current node's value is within the range [low, high].

To fix this bug, we can add an additional condition in the while loop to check if the current node's value is within the range. If it is, we can break out of the loop and continue with trimming the left and right subtrees.

Here is the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        while (root.val < low || root.val > high) {
            root = root.val < low ? root.right : root.left;
            if (root == null)
                return root;
        }
        root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        root.right = trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        return root;
    }
}
```

Explanation of the fix:
1. We first check if the current node `root` is null. If it is, we return null, as there is nothing to trim.
2. In the while loop, we check if the current node's value `root.val` is less than the lower bound `low` or greater than the upper bound `high`.
3. If the current node's value is less than `low`, we move to the right subtree by setting `root` to `root.right`. If it is greater than `high`, we move to the left subtree by setting `root` to `root.left`.
4. If `root` becomes null during this process, it means there is no node within the range [low, high], so we return null.
5. After the while loop, we recursively trim the left and right subtrees by calling `trimBST` on them.
6. Finally, we return the trimmed tree by returning `root`.
