There is a bug in the provided code. 

In the for loop, the condition `i > n` should be changed to `i < n`. Currently, it is set to `i > n`, which means the loop will not execute because `i` is initialized to 0 and it will never be greater than `n`.

To fix this bug, we need to change `i > n` to `i < n` in the for loop condition.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        char[] ch = new char[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ch[i] = 'a';
            k--;
        }
        int currChar = 0;
        while (k > 0) {
            currChar = Math.min(25, k);
            ch[--n] += currChar;
            k -= currChar;
        }
        return String.valueOf(ch);
    }
}
```
