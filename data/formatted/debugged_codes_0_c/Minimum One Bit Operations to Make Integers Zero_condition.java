Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The loop condition is incorrect. The loop should continue until n is not equal to zero, but the condition in the provided code is n==0, which is incorrect.
2. Also, the loop should iterate until n becomes zero, but in the provided code, n is right-shifted (n = n >> 1) inside the loop, which will eventually lead to an infinite loop as n will never become zero.

Fix:
1. Change the loop condition from n==0 to n!=0.
2. Change the right-shift operation to a bitwise AND operation (n = n & (n - 1)) inside the loop. This operation will set the rightmost 1-bit of n to 0 in each iteration, reducing n until it becomes zero.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {

        int inv = 0;

        // xor until n becomes zero
        for (; n != 0; n = n & (n - 1)) {
            inv ^= n;
            System.out.println(inv + " " + n);
        }

        return inv;
    }
}
```
