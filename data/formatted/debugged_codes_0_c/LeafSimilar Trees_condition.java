Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code aims to check if two binary trees have the same sequence of leaf nodes.
2. The leaf nodes of a binary tree are the nodes that have no children (i.e., both left and right child are null).
3. The code defines two ArrayLists, `set1` and `set2`, to store the leaf nodes of each tree.
4. The `getLeafNodes` method is responsible for traversing the tree and adding the leaf nodes to the corresponding set.
5. The `leafSimilar` method calls `getLeafNodes` for both trees and then checks if `set1` is equal to `set2`.
6. However, there is a bug in the `getLeafNodes` method. The base case condition `if (root != null) return;` is incorrect. It should be `if (root == null) return;` to handle the case when the root is null and there are no nodes to traverse.
7. Due to this bug, the code never actually performs the traversal of the trees and never adds any leaf nodes to the sets.
8. This results in both `set1` and `set2` being empty, and the comparison `set1.equals(set2)` always returning true.
9. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the base case of `getLeafNodes` to `if (root == null) return;`.

  public boolean leafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
    set1 = new ArrayList<>();
    set2 = new ArrayList<>();

    getLeafNodes(root1, set1);
    getLeafNodes(root2, set2);

    return set1.equals(set2); // At last we compare the two list formed and check the sequence
  }

  // The function below is to extract all the leaf nodes in the sequence mentioned in the
