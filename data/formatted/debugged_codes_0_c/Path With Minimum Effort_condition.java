Bug type: Array out of bounds error

Reasoning process:
1. The code initializes the `effort` 2D array with dimensions `rows` and `cols` which represent the number of rows and columns in the `heights` array.
2. The code then iterates through each cell in the `heights` array and calculates the minimum effort to reach that cell from the starting cell.
3. To calculate the minimum effort, the code checks each of the four possible directions (up, right, down, left) from the current cell.
4. For each direction, the code calculates the new row index and new column index.
5. The code then checks if the new cell is within bounds by verifying that `newRow` is greater than or equal to 0, `newRow` is less than `rows`, `newCol` is greater than or equal to 0, and `newCol` is less than or equal to `cols`.
6. If the new cell is within bounds, the code calculates the new effort based on the maximum of the height difference between the current cell and the new cell, and the current effort.
7. If the new effort is less than the stored effort for the new cell in the `effort` array, the code updates the stored effort for the new cell and adds the new cell to the min heap for further exploration.

Potential bug:
The potential bug in the code is in the bounds check within the for loop. The condition for checking if the new cell is within bounds is incorrect. The condition `newCol <= cols` should be `newCol < cols`. Since the indices of an array run from 0 to length - 1, the condition should check if `newCol` is less than `cols`, not less than or equal to `cols`.

Fix:
Replace `newCol <= cols` with `newCol < cols` in the bounds check condition within the for loop.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {

    public int minimumEffortPath(int[][] heights) {

        PriorityQueue<Tuple> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((x, y) -> x.distance - y.distance);

        int rows = heights.length;
        int cols = heights[0].length;

        int effort[][] = new int[rows][cols];

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(effort[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }

        effort[0][0] = 0;
