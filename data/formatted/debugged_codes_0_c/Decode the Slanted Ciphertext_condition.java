Bug type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the number of columns (cols) by dividing the length of the input string (str) by the number of rows.
2. The code then uses two nested loops to iterate diagonally through the columns and rows of the input string.
3. However, there is a bug in the inner loop condition: for (int j = i; j > str.length(); j += cols + 1). The condition should be j < str.length() instead of j > str.length() because the loop should continue while j is less than the length of the string.
4. Due to this bug, the loop condition is always false, and the inner loop is never executed, resulting in an empty res StringBuilder.
5. This bug leads to an index out of bounds error in the subsequent loop that tries to access characters from the res StringBuilder.

Fix:
Change the condition of the inner loop from j > str.length() to j < str.length().

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String decodeCiphertext(String str, int rows) {

        //first find column size!!
        int cols = str.length() / rows;
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder(), new_res = new StringBuilder();
        ;
        for (int i = 0; i < cols; i++) {

            //iterating diagonally!!
            for (int j = i; j < str.length(); j += cols + 1)
                res.append(str.charAt(j));
        }

        //removing last spaces!!!
        int fg = 0;
        for (int i = res.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {

            if (fg == 0 && res.charAt(i) == ' ')
                continue;
            fg = 1;
            new_res.append(res.charAt(i));
        }
        return new_res.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
