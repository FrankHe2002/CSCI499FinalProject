The provided Java code appears to be attempting to find a different binary string from the array of strings `nums`. 

The potential bug in the code lies in the line:
```
ans.append(nums[i].charAt(i) == '0' ? '2' : '0');
```

Here's the reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The code uses `nums[i].charAt(i)` to access the character at the `i`th index of the `i`th string in the `nums` array. 
2. However, if the length of the strings in `nums` is not equal to `nums`'s length, it will throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
3. The desired behavior is likely to access the `i`th character from each string in `nums`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the line `ans.append(nums[i].charAt(i) == '0' ? '2' : '0');` to `ans.append(nums[i].charAt(j) == '0' ? '1' : '0');`, where `j` is used as the index instead of `i`.
5. This modification will ensure that the `j`th character from each string in `nums` is accessed and checked.

Here's the modified code after fixing the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public String findDifferentBinaryString(String[] nums) {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            ans.append(nums[i].charAt(i) == '0' ? '1' : '0');
        return ans.toString();
    }
}
```

Note that I replaced `'2'` with `'1'` in the ternary operator since the binary digits are either `'0'` or `'1'`.
