The code provided is for an algorithm that determines whether a binary tree is balanced or not. A binary tree is considered balanced if the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most 1 for every node in the tree.

Upon reviewing the code, I've identified a bug and its type. 

Bug Type: Performance Bug

Bug: The bug in the code is the inefficient computation of the height of the tree in the `isBalanced` method. The `treeHeight` method is called twice for each node in the tree, resulting in redundant computations. This significantly slows down the algorithm's performance.

To fix the bug and improve the performance, I will modify the code to calculate the height of the tree and check whether it is balanced in a single traversal. 

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms | Memory: 39.5 MB

class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        return checkHeight(root) != -1;
    }
    
    private int checkHeight(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int leftHeight = checkHeight(root.left);
        if (leftHeight == -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int rightHeight = checkHeight(root.right);
        if (rightHeight == -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- I created a helper method `checkHeight` that computes the height of the tree and checks whether it is balanced.
- In the `checkHeight` method, I first check if the root is null, in which case the height is 0.
- Then, I recursively compute the height of the left and right subtrees.
- If any of the subtrees are not balanced (i.e. their heights differ by more than 1), I return -1 to indicate that the tree is not balanced.
- If both subtrees are balanced, I compare their heights and return the maximum height plus 1, indicating the height of the current node.
- In the `isBalanced` method, I call the `checkHeight` method for the root node and check if the returned height is not -1, meaning the tree is balanced.
