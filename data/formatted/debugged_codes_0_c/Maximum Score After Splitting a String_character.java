The bug in the provided Java code is a syntax error in the `length()` method call. 

Here's the explanation of the bug identification and fixing process:

1. The `maxScore` method is trying to find the maximum score by splitting the string `s` at every possible position and counting the number of '1's on the left side and the number of '0's on the right side.

2. The bug is in the third part of the `max` calculation, where the length of the substring after `i + 1` is calculated. The code uses the method `length()` without parentheses, which is incorrect.

3. The fix is to change `length` to `length()`, which is the correct method call to get the length of a string.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScore(String s) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++)
            max = Math.max(max, s.substring(0, i + 1).replace("1", "").length() + s.substring(i + 1).replace("0", "").length());

        return max;
    }
}
```

No additional changes are needed. The only fix required was to add parentheses after `length`.
