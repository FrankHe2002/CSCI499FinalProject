Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the angle between each point and the given location using the `angle()` method.
2. It then stores these angles in a List and sorts them.
3. After sorting, the code calculates the maximum number of points that can be seen within the given angle, considering the circular nature of angles.
4. Finally, the code returns the maximum number of points plus the number of overlapping points.

Potential Bug:
The bug in this code lies in the logic for calculating the maximum number of points that can be seen within the given angle. The while loop condition is incorrect.

Proposed Fix:
1. Change the while loop condition to correctly handle the circular nature of angles.
2. Replace `(i2 >= n && 360 + list.get(i2 % n) - list.get(i1) <= angle)` with `(i2 < i1 + n && list.get(i2 % n) - list.get(i1) <= angle)`.

        for (List<Integer> p : points) {
            if (p.get(0) == location.get(0) && p.get(1) == location.get(1)) {
                overlap++;
            } else {
                list.add(angle(p.get(1) - location.get(1),
                        p.get(0) - location.get(0)));
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(list);
        int max = 0;
        int n = list.size();
        int i2 = 0;
        // list.get(i1) is first angle leg
        // list.get(i2) is second angle leg
        for (int i1 = 0; i1 < n; i1++) {
            while ((i2 < i1 + n && list.get(i2 % n) - list.get(i1) <= angle) ||
                    (i2 >= i1 + n && 360 + list.get(i2 % n) - list.get(i1) <= angle)) {
                i2++;
            }
            // after i2 went as far as possible away from i1 under allowed limit - check if a new maximum found
