Based on the given code, there seems to be a bug. If there is a space character in the string `s`, the code checks whether the characters before and after the space character are equal. However, if the space character is at the start or end of the string, it will throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` because there is no character before or after it.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `i` is not equal to `0` or `s.length() - 1` before checking the characters before and after the space.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isCircularSentence(String s) {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == ' ') {
                if (i != 0 && i != s.length() - 1 && s.charAt(i - 1) != s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length() - 1);
    }
}
```
