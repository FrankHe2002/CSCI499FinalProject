Upon analyzing the code, the bug that stands out is in the `split` method, specifically in the initialization of the `right` variable. 

Currently, the `right` variable is initialized as `a.length() - 0`, which is essentially the same as `a.length()`. This means that the `right` variable is always equal to the length of string `a`.

To fix this bug, the `right` variable should be initialized as `a.length() - 1`, so that it represents the last index of string `a`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPalindromeFormation(String a, String b) {
        return split(a, b) || split(b, a);
    }

    private boolean split(String a, String b) {
        int left = 0, right = a.length() - 1; // fix: subtract 1 from a.length()
        while (left < right && a.charAt(left) == b.charAt(right)) {
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        if (left >= right) return true;
        return isPalindrome(a, left, right) || isPalindrome(b, left, right);
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left <= right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
