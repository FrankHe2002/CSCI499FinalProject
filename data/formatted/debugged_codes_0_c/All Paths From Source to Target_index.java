The bug in the provided code is in the `helper()` method. 

Specifically, the line `vis[2] = true;` is incorrect. It should be `vis[src] = true;` in order to mark the current node as visited. 

The reasoning process to identify this bug is as follows:

1. The code is using a Depth First Search (DFS) approach to find all paths from the source node (0) to the target node (graph.length - 1).
2. The `helper()` method is recursively called to explore all possible paths from the current node.
3. The `vis` array is used to keep track of visited nodes.
4. However, in the code, `vis[2] = true;` is setting the third element of the `vis` array to true, which is not correct. It should be `vis[src] = true;` to mark the current node as visited.
5. This bug causes incorrect behavior, as the algorithm will not correctly mark visited nodes and may revisit nodes that have already been visited.
6. The bug can be fixed by changing `vis[2] = true;` to `vis[src] = true;` in the `helper()` method.

Here is the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
        boolean[] visit = new boolean[graph.length];
        helper(graph, 0, graph.length - 1, ans, temp, visit);

        return ans;
    }

    public void helper(int[][] graph, int src, int dest, List<List<Integer>> ans, List<Integer> temp, boolean[] vis) {

        vis[src] = true; // Fix: mark the current node as visited
        temp.add(src);
        if (src == dest) {
            List<Integer> b = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int h : temp) {
                b.add(h);
            }
            ans.add(b);
        }

        for (int i : graph[src]) {
            if (!vis[i]) { // Fix: change vis[i] != true to !vis[i]
                helper(graph, i, dest, ans, temp, vis);
            }
        }

        vis[src] = false;
        temp.remove(temp.size() - 1);
    }
}
```

By making these minimal changes, the bug in the provided code is fixed
