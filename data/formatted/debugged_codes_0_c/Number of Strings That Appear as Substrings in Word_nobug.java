The provided code checks if any pattern in the `patterns` array is a substring of the `word` string and increments the `count` variable accordingly. 

There doesn't seem to be any logical errors or bugs in the code, as it correctly counts the number of patterns that appear in the word. 

The only thing that could be considered a potential bug is if the `patterns` array or the `word` string is `null`, as this could lead to a `NullPointerException`. However, since there is no requirement or validation for null inputs in the given code, it can be assumed that the input will always be valid.

So, no bug exists in the provided code.

Here is the code in markdown format:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfStrings(String[] patterns, String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < patterns.length; i++) {
            if (word.contains(patterns[i])) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
