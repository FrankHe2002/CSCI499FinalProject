The provided code truncates a given sentence `s` at the `k`th word. However, there is a bug in the code that causes it to truncate the sentence one word too early.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `while` loop to account for the last word of the sentence. Currently, the condition only checks for spaces, which means the last word is not counted towards the `k`th word.

The fix can be applied by updating the condition in the `if` statement to `(count == k - 1)` instead of `(count == k)`. This ensures that the last word is included in the truncated sentence.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix applied:

```java
class Solution {
    public String truncateSentence(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == ' ') {
                count++;
                if (count == k - 1)
                    return s.substring(0, i);
            }
            i++;
        }
        return s;
    }
}
```
