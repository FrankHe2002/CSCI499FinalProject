The provided Java code appears to be correct and does not contain any bugs. 

The `digiSum` method calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by continuously dividing the number by 10 and keeping track of the remainders.

The `differenceOfSum` method iterates over the given array of numbers, calculating the sum of all elements and the sum of the digits of each element using the `digiSum` method. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the element sum and the digit sum.

There is no logical error or syntax error in the code. It follows the correct logic for calculating the digit sum and the difference of sums. Additionally, the code has been optimized to have minimal runtime and memory usage.

Therefore, no bug has been identified in the provided code.
