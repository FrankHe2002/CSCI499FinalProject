The bug in the provided code is that the condition in the while loop is incorrect. The goal of the code is to find the k closest elements to the target value x in the given array arr. However, the current condition `high - low >= k` is incorrect because it checks the difference between the indices, not the number of elements.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `high - low + 1 > k`, which checks if the number of elements between high and low (inclusive) is greater than k.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 13 ms (Top 41.96%) | Memory: 62.2 MB (Top 71.32%)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findClosestElements(int[] arr, int k, int x) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;

        while (high - low + 1 > k) {
            if (Math.abs(arr[low] - x) < Math.abs(arr[high] - x))
                low++;
            else
                high--;
        }

        for (int i = low; i <= high; i++)
            result.add(arr[i]);

        return result;
    }
}
```
