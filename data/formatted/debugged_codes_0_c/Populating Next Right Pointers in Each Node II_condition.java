Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code aims to connect the nodes in a binary tree in the manner similar to a linked list.
2. The code uses three pointers: `head`, `prev`, and `curr`.
3. The outer while loop iterates through each level of the tree, starting from the root.
4. The inner while loop traverses each node in the current level and connects its children nodes.
5. The bug is present in the inner while loop where the code connects the right child node of `curr` instead of the left child node when the right child is not null.
6. This is a logical error because the right child should not be connected in this scenario. Instead, we should connect the left child node of `curr` when it is not null.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        Node head = null; //the start node of next level, the first left of next level
        Node prev = null; //the next pointer
        Node curr = root;

        while (curr != null) {
            //traverse the whole current level, left -> right, until we meet a null pointer
            while (curr != null) {
                if (curr.left != null) {
                    if (head == null) {
                        head = curr.left;
                        prev = curr.left;
                    } else {
                        prev.next = curr.left;
                        prev = prev.next;
                    }
                }

                if (curr.right != null) {    // Fix: changed curr.right == null to curr.right != null
                    if (head == null) {
                        head = curr.right;
                        prev = curr.right;
                    } else {
                        prev.next = curr.right;
                        prev = prev.next;
                    }
                }
                curr = curr.next;
            }

            curr = head;
            prev = null;
            head = null;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

The fix involves changing `curr.right == null` to `curr.right != null` in order to connect the left child node instead of the right child node.
