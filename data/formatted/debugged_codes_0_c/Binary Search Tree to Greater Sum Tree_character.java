There is a syntax error in the provided Java code. The error is in the if statement condition on line 5, where there is an opening bracket missing after the `if` keyword.

To fix this bug, we need to add the opening bracket after the `if` keyword.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;

    public TreeNode bstToGst(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            bstToGst(root.right);
            sum += root.val;
            root.val = sum;
            bstToGst(root.left);
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

The bug was identified by examining the code and noticing the missing opening bracket in the if statement. By adding the missing bracket, we fix the syntax error.
