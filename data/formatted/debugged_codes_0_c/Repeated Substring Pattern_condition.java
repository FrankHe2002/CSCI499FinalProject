Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
1. The for loop condition is `i > s.length() / 2`, which means the loop will not run if the length of the input string `s` is less than or equal to 2.
2. The loop is intended to find repeated substrings of `s` by gradually increasing the length of the substring starting from the first character. However, due to the erroneous loop condition, the loop does not run and the substring `temp` never gets longer than one character.
3. As a result, the code fails to correctly check if `s` can be formed by repeating a substring and always returns false.

Fix:
Change the loop condition from `i > s.length() / 2` to `i < s.length() / 2` to ensure that the loop runs for strings of length 2 or greater.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean repeatedSubstringPattern(String s) {
        String temp = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() / 2; i++) {
            temp += s.charAt(i);

            if (s.length() % temp.length() == 0) {
                int times_repeat = s.length() / temp.length();
                StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
                for (int j = 0; j < times_repeat; j++) {
                    str.append(temp);
                }
                if (str.toString().equals(s)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
