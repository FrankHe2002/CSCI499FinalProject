The provided Java code has a bug. 

The bug is in the inner loop condition where it checks `j < n`. It should be `j < n-1` because the code is accessing `obstacleGrid[i][j+1]` inside the loop. 

To fix this bug, we should change the inner loop condition from `j < n` to `j < n-1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length, n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        int[][] path = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = -1; j < n-1; j++) {
                //if there is an obstacle at the current block then you cannot get there
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j+1] != 1) {
                    if (i == 0 && j == -1)
                        path[i][j+1] = 1;
                    if (i > 0)
                        path[i][j+1] += path[i - 1][j+1];
                    if (j > -1)
                        path[i][j+1] += path[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return path[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```
