The code appears to have a bug related to the `restricted` array. It is used to mark certain nodes as restricted, which means they cannot be visited. However, the code only marks the nodes as `true` in the `vis` array, but does not check if a node is restricted before visiting it in the DFS traversal. This may lead to restricted nodes being visited, resulting in incorrect counting.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check in the DFS traversal to skip visiting a node if it is marked as restricted in the `vis` array.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {
    int count = 0;
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();

    public int reachableNodes(int n, int[][] edges, int[] restricted) {
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[n];
        for (int i : restricted) {
            vis[i] = true;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] ii : edges) {
            adj.get(ii[0]).add(ii[1]);
            adj.get(ii[1]).add(ii[0]);
        }
        dfs(0, vis);
        return count;
    }

    private void dfs(int node, boolean[] vis) {
        if (vis[node]) {
            return; // Skip visiting restricted nodes
        }
        vis[node] = true;
        count++;
        for (int it : adj.get(node)) {
            dfs(it, vis);
        }
    }
}
```

In this fix, we added the check `if (vis[node])` before marking the node as visited and proceeding with the DFS traversal. This ensures that restricted nodes are not visited and counted.
