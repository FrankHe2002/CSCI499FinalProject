There seems to be a typo in the code. The line `while (p[num] != % 1)` should be changed to `while (p[num] != -1)`.

Explanation:
1. The code initializes two HashMaps: `map` to store locked nodes and the user who locked them, and `children` to store the children of each node.
2. The `LockingTree` constructor takes an array `parent` as input, which represents the parent of each node. It initializes the `children` HashMap by adding each node as a key with an empty list as the value.
3. The `lock` method checks if a node is already locked. If it is not locked, it adds the node to the `map` HashMap as a key with the user as the value and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
4. The `unlock` method checks if a node is locked by a specific user. If it is locked by that user, it removes the node from the `map` HashMap and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
5. The `upgrade` method checks if a node can be upgraded to a locked state. It first checks if the node is already locked, in which case it returns false. Then, it checks all ancestors of the node to ensure that none of them are locked. If any ancestor is locked, it returns false. Finally, it checks all descendants of the node to see if any of them are locked. If any descendent is locked, it unlocks all locked descendants and locks the original node before returning true. Otherwise, it returns false.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `while (p[num] != % 1)` to `while (p[num] != -1)`. This change removes the typo and correctly checks if the parent node is not equal to -1.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class LockingTree {
    int[] p;
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Integer, List<Integer>> children = new HashMap<>();

    public LockingTree(int[] parent) {
        p = parent;
        for (int i = 0; i < p.length; i++) {
            children.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < p.length; i++) {
            children.get(p[i]).add(i);
        }
    }

    public boolean lock(int num, int user) {
        if (! map.containsKey
