Bug type: Infinite loop

Reasoning process:
1. The code uses a while loop to continue iterating until the variable "remaining" becomes zero.
2. Inside the while loop, there are two for loops that iterate over the array "freq" to append characters to the result StringBuilder.
3. However, if there are no characters remaining to be appended (i.e. "remaining" is already zero), the while loop will not exit and will continue indefinitely.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to the while loop to check if "remaining" is already zero. If so, we can break out of the loop.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String sortString(String s) {

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        int remaining = s.length();
        while (remaining != 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 26 && remaining != 0; i++) {
                if (freq[i] != 0) {
                    freq[i]--;
                    result.append((char) (i + 'a'));
                    remaining--;
                }
            }
            if (remaining == 0) { // Check if the remaining is already zero
                break; // Exit the while loop
            }
            for (int i = 25; i >= 0 && remaining != 0; i--) { // Fixed the condition to include i = 0
                if (freq[i] != 0) {
                    freq[i]--;
                    result.append((char) (i + 'a'));
                    remaining--;
                }
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```
