Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process:
1. The code uses memoization to store the results of subproblems, with the key being the number of stones remaining.
2. If the memo contains the result for the current number of stones, it returns the result, otherwise it continues to calculate it.
3. The code iterates over a list of perfect squares and checks if each perfect square is less than or equal to the current number of stones.
4. If a perfect square is less than or equal to the current number of stones, the code calls the `playerWins` function recursively with the new number of stones (reducing the number of stones by the perfect square) and checks if the other player does not win in that scenario.
5. If the other player does not win, it updates the memoization map and breaks out of the loop.
6. After the loop, the code checks the value in the memoization map and returns it.

Bug:
There is no bug in the code.

Fix:
No fix required.
