Bug type: Null Pointer Exception

Reasoning process:
1. The code uses a queue to perform a level order traversal of the binary tree.
2. The queue is initialized with the root node and the traversal starts.
3. In each iteration, a node is polled from the queue.
4. If the polled node is not null, the variable "end" is set to true.
5. If the polled node is null, the code checks if "end" is true. If it is true, it means that a null node has been encountered after encountering a non-null node. In a complete binary tree, all the nodes after a null node must also be null. If "end" is true and the current node is null, it implies that the tree is not a complete binary tree and false should be returned.
6. If "end" is false and the current node is null, it means that the tree has not been fully traversed yet. In that case, the left and right children of the current node are added to the queue.
7. The traversal continues until the queue is empty. If the loop completes without returning false, it means that the tree is a complete binary tree and true should be returned.

The bug in the code is in the line where the left and right children of the current node are added to the queue:
```java
queue.offer(currentNode.left);
queue.offer(currentNode.right);
```

If the current node is null, calling `currentNode.left` and `currentNode.right` will result in a NullPointerException.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the current node is null before adding its children to the queue. If the current node is not null, we can add its children to the queue as before. If the current node is null, there is no need to add its children to the queue since they will all be null as well.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root) {
        boolean end = false;
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode currentNode = queue.poll();
            if (currentNode != null) {
                end = true;
                queue.offer(currentNode.left);
                queue.offer(currentNode.right);
            } else {
                if (end) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
