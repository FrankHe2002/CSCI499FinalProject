The provided Java code has a bug. 

In the for loop, when checking for the value of 'max', the code compares it to 'flips[i + 1]' instead of 'flips[i]'.

This bug can be identified by analyzing the logic of the code and understanding the intent of the variable 'max'. The variable 'max' is used to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far in the 'flips' array. The correct comparison should be between 'max' and 'flips[i]', not 'flips[i + 1]'.

To fix the bug, we need to change 'flips[i + 1]' to 'flips[i]'.

Here is the modified code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numTimesAllBlue(int[] flips) {
        int counter = 0, total = 0, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < flips.length; i++) {
            if (max < flips[i]) max = flips[i];
            if (++counter == max) total++;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```
