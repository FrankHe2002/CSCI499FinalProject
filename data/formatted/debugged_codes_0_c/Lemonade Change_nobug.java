The provided code is missing a case when a customer pays with a $20 bill and there is not enough change available with $5 and $10 bills. In this case, the code incorrectly assumes that it can give change by using three $5 bills. 

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the count5 variable is greater than or equal to 3 before deducting three $5 bills. If count5 is less than 3 or zero, we should return false.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int count5 = 0, count10 = 0;
        for (int p : bills) {
            if (p == 5) {
                count5++;
            } else if (p == 10) {
                if (count5 > 0) {
                    count5--;
                    count10++;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            } else if (p == 20) {
                if (count5 > 0 && count10 > 0) {
                    count5--;
                    count10--;
                } else if (count5 >= 3) {
                    count5 -= 3;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
