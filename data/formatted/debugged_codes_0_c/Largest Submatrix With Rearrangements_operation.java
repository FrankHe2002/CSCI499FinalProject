I will review the provided Java code to identify any potential bugs.

1. In the first nested for loop, the code attempts to store the number of consecutive 1s along each column ending at index (i,j) in `matrix[i][j]`. This implementation is correct.

2. In the second nested for loop, the code initializes a PriorityQueue, `pq`, and adds all the entries from row i in min-heap. This implementation is correct.

3. Inside the while loop, the code retrieves the minimum value from `pq` using the `peek()` method and assigns it to `curr`. The next line calculates the size of the current square, `size`, using the formula `size = curr - pq.size()`. However, this formula is incorrect. It should be `size = curr * pq.size()`, as mentioned in the code comment. Therefore, the bug type in this code is a logical error.

To fix the bug, I will modify the formula to `size = curr * pq.size()` and store the maximum size encountered in `maxSize`.
