Upon reviewing the code, the bug seems to be related to the logic used to remove duplicates from the input array. Here's the reasoning process to identify and fix the bug:

1. The code initializes `i` to 0, indicating the current position in the modified array.
2. It starts a loop from `j = 1` to `arr.length - 1`.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the element at `arr[i]` is not equal to the element at `arr[j]`.
4. If the elements are not equal, it increments `i` and assigns `arr[j]` to `arr[i]`.
5. Finally, it returns `i + 1`, which represents the length of the modified array.

To identify whether there's a bug, we need to analyze the logic:

- The code assumes that the input array is sorted and contains duplicates.
- The current logic correctly identifies and removes duplicates as expected.
- The code uses in-place modification, so the modified array will be placed at the beginning of the input array.

Based on the reasoning, there doesn't seem to be any bug in the given code.

However, we can make a small fix to improve the code readability. By renaming the variables, we can make the code more understandable:

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0; // Index for modified array
        
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[j]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j]; // Assign the unique number
            }
        }
        
        return i + 1; // Length of modified array
    }
}
```

By renaming `arr` to `nums`, the code becomes clearer and easier to understand, which is important for maintaining code in the long term.
