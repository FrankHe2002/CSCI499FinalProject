Bug: The bug in the code is in the line where `k *= num[i]` is performed. Instead of multiplying `k` with `num[i]`, it should be added. 

Reasoning: The purpose of the code is to add the given number `k` to the array `num` in the form of a list. The bug is identified by understanding the logic and purpose of the code. In this case, the calculation `k *= num[i]` is incorrect because it multiplies `k` with `num[i]` instead of adding. This will give incorrect results.

Fix: The fix for the bug is to replace `k *= num[i]` with `k += num[i]` to correctly add the digit from the array `num` to `k`.

Updated Code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> addToArrayForm(int[] num, int k) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

        int i = num.length;
        while (-- i >= 0 || k > 0) {
            if (i >= 0)
                k += num[i];

            res.add(k % 10);
            k /= 10;
        }
        Collections.reverse(res);

        return res;
    }
}
```
