The code contains a bug. The bug is in the use of Math.log11 instead of Math.log10 for computing the logarithm of n. The correct implementation should be Math.log10(n). 

To identify the bug, we can start by understanding the purpose of the code. The code is attempting to determine whether a given number n is a power of 4. 

The implementation calculates the logarithm base 4 of n using Math.log10(4) and the logarithm base 10 of n using Math.log10(n). Then it checks if the result is an integer by taking the modulo 1. If the result is 0, then n is a power of 4. 

In the given code, the use of Math.log11 is incorrect. The function Math.log11 does not exist in the Math library. It should be replaced with Math.log10.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        return (Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(4)) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
```
