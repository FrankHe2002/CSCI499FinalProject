Bug type: Logic error

The bug in this code is that it does not correctly calculate the maximum score and the number of nodes with the maximum score.

To identify the bug, we can go through the code step by step:

1. The code starts by initializing the `max` and `res` variables to 0. These variables will store the maximum score and the number of nodes with the maximum score, respectively.

2. The `countHighestScoreNodes` method takes an array of `parents` as input. It creates a HashMap `hm` to represent the tree structure. It then iterates over the `parents` array and builds the tree structure in the `hm` HashMap.

3. The `dfs` method is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search on the tree. It takes three parameters: the current node `s`, the total number of nodes in the tree `n`, and the tree structure represented by the `hm` HashMap.

4. Inside the `dfs` method, it initializes `sum` to 1, which represents the count of nodes in the current subtree (including the current node itself).

5. It then iterates over the child nodes of the current node `s` using the `hm.getOrDefault(s, new ArrayList<>())` expression. For each child node, it recursively calls the `dfs` method to get the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at that child node and adds it to `sum`. It also multiplies the count by `mult`, which represents the product of the counts of all the child subtrees.

6. After calculating the `sum` and `mult` values, it multiplies `mult` by `(s == 0 ? 1L : n + sum)`. This is where the bug occurs. The intention of this multiplication is to multiply `mult` by the size of the remaining nodes in the tree (excluding the current node `s` and its children). However, the calculation is incorrect because it adds `n` to `sum` instead of subtracting it.

7. Finally, the code compares the calculated `mult` with the current maximum score `max`. If `mult` is greater than `max`, it updates `max` with `mult` and sets `res` to 1. If `mult` is equal to `max`, it increments `res` by 1.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `mult *= (s == 0 ? 1L : n + sum
