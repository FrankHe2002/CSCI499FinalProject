Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code initializes a 3D array `dp` with dimensions [101][101][201]. 
2. The code then tries to access the `dp` array at index `m-1` and `n-1` (where `m` and `n` represent the dimensions of the `grid` array).
3. However, the dimensions of the `dp` array are fixed at [101][101][201], so if `m` or `n` is greater than 100, it will result in an array index out of bounds error.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the dimensions of the `dp` array should be based on the dimensions of the `grid` array. Replace the initialization of the `dp` array with:
```java
dp = new Boolean[m][n][201]; // [row][col][open-close]
```
