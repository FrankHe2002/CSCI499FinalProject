Bug Type: Correctness.

Reasoning Process:

1. The code calculates the maximum difference between two elements in the given array.

2. The variable "result" is initially set to Integer.MIN_VALUE, which indicates that no valid difference has been found yet.

3. The variable "minValue" is initialized with the first element of the array.

4. The code loops through the rest of the array (from index 1 to index length-1).

5. For each element, if it is greater than "minValue", the code calculates the difference and updates "result" if the difference is greater than the current "result".

6. After that, the code checks if the current element is smaller than "minValue" and updates "minValue" accordingly.

7. Finally, the code returns "result" if it is not equal to Integer.MIN_VALUE, indicating a valid difference. Otherwise, it returns -1.

Based on this analysis, there doesn't seem to be any bug in the provided code. It correctly calculates the maximum difference between two elements in the array.

However, there is a minor improvement that can be made:

The initial value of "result" can be set to a more appropriate value, such as 0, since the difference between two equal elements should be 0.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumDifference(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 2)
            return -1;
        int result = 0;
        int minValue = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > minValue)
                result = Math.max(result, nums[i] - minValue);
            minValue = Math.min(minValue, nums[i]);
        }
        return result == 0 ? -1 : result;
    }
}
```

By making this slight modification, we provide a more intuitive behavior, where the maximum difference between two equal elements is correctly considered as 0.
