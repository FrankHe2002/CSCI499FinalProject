The bug in the provided code is the incorrect indexing of the `dirs` array in the `markAndCountStableBricks` method. Currently, the code has `[` instead of `(` when declaring the array. This will cause a compilation error. 

To fix the bug, we need to replace the `[` with `(` to correctly declare the array:

Before:
```java
for (int] dir : dirs) {
```

After:
```java
for (int[] dir : dirs) {
```

This should resolve the bug and allow the code to compile and run correctly.
