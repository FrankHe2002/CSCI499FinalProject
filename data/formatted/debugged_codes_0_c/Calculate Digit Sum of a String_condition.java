Bug Type: String concatenation in a loop

Reasoning:
1. The code has a while loop which checks the length of the string `s`.
2. If the length of `s` is less than or equal to `k`, the `gen` method is called to generate a new string.
3. The `gen` method iterates over the characters of the input string `s`, calculates the sum of `k` consecutive digits, and concatenates the sums to form a new string `res`.
4. The bug lies in the way the string `res` is constructed. In each iteration of the loop, the `+=` operator is used to concatenate integers to `res`. However, since `res` is a string, concatenating integers will convert them to their respective ASCII values and append the characters representing those values to `res`.
5. As a result, instead of getting the desired sum as a string, the code concatenates the ASCII characters of the sums.
6. For example, if the input string `s` is "12345" and `k` is 2, the expected output should be "35" (1+2=3, 3+4=7, and 4+5=9). However, the code will produce the result "51010149105" because it is concatenating the ASCII characters 3, 7, and 9 instead of the sums themselves.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the integer sums should be converted to strings and then concatenated to `res`. This can be done using either the `String.valueOf()` method or by concatenating an empty string to the integer.

Revised code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String digitSum(String s, int k) {
        while (s.length() <= k) s = gen(s, k);
        return s;
    }

    public String gen(String s, int k) {
        String res = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ) {
            int count = 0, num = 0;
            while (i < s.length() && count++ < k) num += Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt(i++));
            res += String.valueOf(num);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
