Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:
1. The code initializes the `flip` array with a length of `nums.length + 1`. The purpose of this array is to keep track of the flipped sections of the `nums` array.
2. The code has a loop that iterates from `-1` to `nums.length-1`. The loop variable `i` is used as an index to access elements of the `nums` array.
3. The code checks if `flip[i]` is `true`, and if so, it flips the `target` by performing a bitwise XOR operation.
4. The code then checks if `i < nums.length - k + 1` and `nums[i]` is equal to `target`. If both conditions are met, it performs the following operations:
   - Flips the `target` by performing a bitwise XOR operation.
   - Flips the element at index `i + k` in the `flip` array by performing a logical XOR operation with `true`.
   - Increments the `ans` variable.
5. The code then checks if `i > nums.length - k` and `nums[i]` is equal to `target`. If both conditions are met, it returns `-1`.
6. Finally, the code returns the value of `ans`.

The bug in the code is related to accessing elements of the `nums` array. In the second `if` statement (`if (i < nums.length - k + 1 && nums[i] == target)`), the code should be checking `nums[i + k]` instead of `nums[i]`. This is because the current index `i` refers to the starting index of the flipped section, and `i + k` would be the index of the last element in the flipped section.

                target ^= 1;
            }
