The bug in the provided Java code is in the calculation of the minimum absolute difference. In the first for loop, the condition for updating the minimum difference is incorrect. Instead of `if (diff >= min)`, it should be `if (diff <= min)`.

To fix the bug, we'll change the condition in the first for loop to `if (diff <= min)`. This will correctly update the minimum difference if the current difference is smaller than the current minimum difference.

The corrected code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> minimumAbsDifference(int[] arr) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            int diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1]);
            if (diff <= min) {
                min = diff;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            int diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1]);
            if (diff == min) {
                List<Integer> pair = new ArrayList<>(2);
                pair.add(arr[i]);
                pair.add(arr[i + 1]);
                ans.add(pair);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that the minimum absolute difference is correctly calculated and used to find the pairs with that minimum difference.
