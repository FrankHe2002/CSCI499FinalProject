Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:
- The bug is likely to be found in the for loop that adds elements to the priority queue.
- In each iteration, the code tries to add `stones[-1]` to the priority queue.
- The index `-1` is invalid for an array and will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:
- Assuming that the intention was to add `stones[i]` instead of `stones[-1]`, the fix is to change `stones[-1]` to `stones[i]` in the for loop.

Updated Java code:
```java

class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((x, y) -> Integer.compare(y, x));
        for (int i = 0; i < stones.length; i++) {
            pq.add(stones[i]);
        }
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int r1 = pq.poll();
            int r2 = pq.poll();
            if (r1 != r2) pq.add(r1 - r2);
        }
        return (pq.isEmpty()) ? 0 : pq.poll();
    }
}
