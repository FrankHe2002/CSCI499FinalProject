Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning process:

1. The code iterates through each character of the string, 's'.
2. If the character is '0', it updates the variable zeroToOne by taking the minimum value between zeroToOne + 1 and countOfOnes.
3. If the character is '1', it updates the variable countOfOnes by incrementing it by 1.

The bug in the code is that when the character is '0', the variable zeroToOne is not updated correctly. The current logic takes the minimum value between zeroToOne + 1 and countOfOnes. However, this logic does not consider the case where the minimum value should be zeroToOne without incrementing.

To fix the bug, the code should update the zeroToOne variable correctly when the character is '0'. It should only increment zeroToOne if the countOfOnes is greater than zeroToOne.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlipsMonoIncr(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int zeroToOne = 0;
        int countOfOnes = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '0') {
                if (countOfOnes > zeroToOne)
                    zeroToOne++;
            } else {
                countOfOnes++;
            }
        }
        return zeroToOne;
    }
}
```
