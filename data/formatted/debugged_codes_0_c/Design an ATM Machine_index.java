Bug type: Array Index Error

Reasoning process:
1. The code declares an array `notes` with a length of 5. The array is intended to represent the quantity of each denomination of banknotes in the ATM.
2. In the `deposit` method, the code attempts to update the `notes` array by adding the deposited banknotes to it. The `notes` array is accessed using an index (`i + 1`).
3. The loop in the `deposit` method iterates over the `banknotesCount` array, which may have a different length than `notes`.
4. If `banknotesCount` is longer than 4, then accessing `notes[i + 1]` will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:
1. To fix the bug, change the loop condition in the `deposit` method to iterate up to the minimum of `banknotesCount.length` and `notes.length - 1`.
2. This ensures that the loop doesn't exceed the bounds of the `notes` array.

Updated code:

```java
public void deposit(int[] banknotesCount) {
    for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(banknotesCount.length, notes.length - 1); i++) {
        notes[i + 1] += banknotesCount[i];
    }
}
```
