Bug type: Infinite loop

Reasoning process:
1. The first loop is intended to calculate the initial values of `sum1` and `sum2`.
2. The second loop is intended to calculate the maximum value of the result.
3. Upon inspecting the first loop, we can see that the condition of the loop is `i >= nums.length`. This means that the loop will only execute if `i` is greater than or equal to `nums.length`.
4. Since `i` is initially set to 0, and `nums.length` is typically greater than 0, the condition of the loop will be false and the loop will not execute.

Fix:
Change the condition of the first loop from `i >= nums.length` to `i < nums.length`.
