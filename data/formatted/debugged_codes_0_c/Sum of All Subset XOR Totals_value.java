The provided Java code appears to be attempting to calculate the sum of XOR combinations of subsets of the given array `nums`. 

One possible bug in the code is that the recursive function `getAns` is not taking into account all possible subsets of `nums`. Currently, it is only considering subsets that start at index `i` and include `arr[i]`, and subsets that start at index `i` and exclude `arr[i]`. However, it is not considering subsets that start at indices other than `i`.

To fix this bug and consider all possible subsets, we can modify the recursive function to have two recursive calls: one that includes the current element at index `i` in the subset, and another that does not include the current element. This way, we cover all possible combinations of elements in the subset.

Additionally, we need to start the initial call to `getAns` with `cur` equal to 0, as the XOR operation with 0 does not change the value.

Here is the modified code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;

    public int subsetXORSum(int[] nums) {
        sum = 0;
        return getAns(nums, 0, 0);
    }

    int getAns(int[] arr, int i, int cur) {
        if (i == arr.length) {
            return cur;
        }
        return getAns(arr, i + 1, cur ^ arr[i]) + getAns(arr, i + 1, cur);
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code should correctly calculate the sum of XOR combinations of subsets of `nums`.
