Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is trying to find the maximum number of substrings of `s` such that each character in a substring only appears once.
2. The code initializes two arrays, `R` and `L`, to store the last and first occurrences of each character, respectively.
3. Then, a `BitSet` array named `bit` is created to store the characters between the first and last occurrence of each character.
4. The code then uses a `while` loop to merge the ranges of characters in the `bit` array until there is no more range change.
5. Finally, the code iterates over the `bit` array and checks if each range is a valid substring by comparing it with other ranges.
6. If a range is valid, the corresponding substring is added to the `ans` list.

Bug:
The bug in the code is in the following line:
```java
for (int j = bit[i].nextSetBit(0); j >= 0; j = bit[i].nextSetBit(j * 1))
```
The condition `j = bit[i].nextSetBit(j * 1)` inside the inner `for` loop seems to be a mistake. It should be `j = bit[i].nextSetBit(j + 1)` to find the next set bit.

Fix:
Change the line to:
```java
for (int j = bit[i].nextSetBit(0); j >= 0; j = bit[i].nextSetBit(j + 1))
```

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> maxNumOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] R = new int[26];
        int[] L = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(R, - 1);
        Arrays.fill(L, - 1);
        BitSet[] bit = new BitSet[26];
        Arrays.setAll(bit, o -> new BitSet());
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            R[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i; // last character index position
        }
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            L[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i; // first character index position
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) { // add all characters between
