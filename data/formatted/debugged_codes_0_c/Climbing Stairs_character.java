Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code is trying to compute the number of ways to climb to the top of a staircase using dynamic programming.
2. To avoid repeated calculations, the code uses an array called "memo" to store the results for each subproblem.
3. The function `climbStairs` initializes the memo array and then calls the helper function `calculateWays` to compute the result.
4. The helper function `calculateWays` uses recursion to calculate the result.
5. The base case is when `n` is equal to 1 or 2, in which case the result is simply `n`.
6. If the result for the current value of `n` is already stored in the memo array, it is returned.
7. Otherwise, the result is calculated by adding the results for `n-1` and `n-2`, and then stored in the memo array before returning.

The bug in the code is a syntax error. In the `climbStairs` function, there is a missing closing parenthesis ")" when calling the `calculateWays` function. 

Fix:
The missing closing parenthesis needs to be added after the "memo" array in the return statement of the `climbStairs` function.

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int[] memo = new int[n + 1];
        return calculateWays(n, memo);
    }

    private int calculateWays(int n, int[] memo) {
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
            return n;
        }

        if (memo[n] != 0) {
            return memo[n];
        }

        memo[n] = calculateWays(n - 1, memo) + calculateWays(n - 2, memo);
        return memo[n];
    }
}
