Potential Bug:

In the code snippet, there seems to be a bug in the calculation of the `numberOfPlates` array. 

Upon further analysis, the issue lies with the line `numberOfPlates[i + 1] = numberOfPlates[i] * (s.charAt(i) == '*' ? 1 : 0);`. 

This line of code is calculating the cumulative number of plates by multiplying the previous value with 0 or 1 based on the character at the current index. 

However, the calculation should be an addition, not a multiplication. The multiplication operation will always result in 0, as it is a binary multiplication between 0 and 1. This will cause incorrect results for `numberOfPlates`.

To fix this bug, the multiplication operation should be changed to an addition operation.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 20 ms (Top 58.35%) | Memory: 143.3 MB (Top 38.21%)
class Solution {
    // O(sLen + queries.length) time, O(sLen) space
    public int[] platesBetweenCandles(String s, int[][] queries) {
        int sLen = s.length();
        // cumulative number of plates from the left
        int[] numberOfPlates = new int[sLen + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < sLen; i++) {
            numberOfPlates[i + 1] = numberOfPlates[i] + (s.charAt(i) == '*' ? 1 : 0);
        }
        // closest candle to the left
        int[] candleToTheLeft = new int[sLen];
        int cand = - 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < sLen; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '|') {
                cand = i;
            }
            candleToTheLeft[i] = cand;
        }
        // closest candle to the right
        int[] candleToTheRight = new int[sLen];
        cand = - 1;
        for (int i = sLen - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '|') {
                cand = i;
            }
            candleToTheRight[i] = cand;
        }
        // for each query - count the number of plates between closest candles
        int[] res = new int[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries
