Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Error

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes a 4-dimensional array called `stepCount` with dimensions 101x2x2x10.
2. The last dimension of the array represents the number of options available to fill the current position.
3. In the `countStepNums` method, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to `limit`, where `limit` is calculated based on the `isBounded` variable.
4. Within the loop, the code attempts to access `stepCount[numIndx][isBounded][arePrevZeroes][prevDigs]`, which corresponds to the current position in the `stepCount` array.
5. However, the indexing expression `isBounded + 2` can have a value of either 0 or 1, which is out of bounds for the second dimension of the `stepCount` array (which has a size of 2).
6. This can result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the indexing expression `isBounded + 2` to `isBounded`. This ensures that the correct index is used to access the `stepCount` array.

Updated Code:

```java
class Solution {
    private int mod = 1000000007;

    private Integer stepCount[][][][] = null;

    public int countSteppingNumbers(String low, String high) {
        stepCount = new Integer[101][2][2][10];
        int left = countStepNums(low, 0, 1, 1, 0);

        stepCount = new Integer[101][2][2][10];
        int right = countStepNums(high, 0, 1, 1, 0);

        int answer = (right % mod - left % mod + mod) % mod;

        boolean incLow = true;
        for (int indx = 0; indx < low.length(); indx++) {
            if (indx != 0 && Math.abs(low.charAt(indx) - low.charAt(indx - 1)) != 1) incLow = false;
        }
        if (incLow) answer = (answer + 1) % mod;

        return (int) answer;
    }

    private int countStepNums(String numStr, int numIndx, int isBounded,
                              int arePrevZeroes, int prevDigs) {
