The bug in the provided code lies in the conditional statement for checking if `i` is equal to 1, which should be changed to `else if (i == 1)` instead of `else if (i != 0)`. This is because the intention is to check if the current element is equal to 1, not if it is not equal to 0.

To fix the bug, replace the line `if (i != 0)` with `else if (i == 1)`. This will ensure that the correct operations are performed for each case.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 81 ms (Top 33.85%) | Memory: 118.7 MB (Top 84.62%)
class Solution {
    public int countSpecialSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        long z = 0; //starting and ending with zero
        long zo = 0; //starting with zero and ending with One
        long zot = 0;//starting with zero and ending Two
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i == 0) {
                z = ((2 * z) % mod + 1) % mod; //zero = 2*zero+1
            } else if (i == 1) {
                zo = ((2 * zo) % mod + z % mod) % mod; //zero = 2*zeroOne+zero
            } else {
                zot = ((2 * zot) % mod + zo % mod) % mod; //zeroOneTwo = 2*zeroOneTwo+zeroOne
            }
        }
        return (int) (zot % mod);
    }
}
```

By correcting the conditional statement, the code should now work as intended without any bugs.
