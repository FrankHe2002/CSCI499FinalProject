The bug in the provided code is in the loop where the original elements are determined. The loop iterates over the `changed` array instead of the `res` array, which should contain the original elements.

To fix the bug, we need to change the loop to iterate over the `res` array and update the `changed` array to set the elements to 0 once they are used.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 93 ms (Top 85.10%) | Memory: 128.6 MB (Top 72.29%)
class Solution {
    public int[] findOriginalArray(int[] changed) {

        Arrays.sort(changed);

        if (changed.length % 2 != 0) return new int[0];

        int mid = changed.length / 2;

        int[] res = new int[mid];

        int[] freq = new int[100001];

        for (int no : changed)
            freq[no]++;

        int idx = 0;

        for (int no : res) { // fix: iterate over res array instead of changed array
            if (freq[no] > 0 && no * 2 < 100000 && freq[no * 2] > 0) {
                freq[no]--;
                freq[no * 2]--;
                changed[idx++] = no; // fix: set changed element to 0
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < freq.length; i++) {
            if (freq[i] != 0) return new int[0];
        }

        return res;

    }
}
```

The bug is fixed by correctly iterating over the `res` array and updating the `changed` array. The elements are set to 0 once they are used to avoid duplicate counts.
