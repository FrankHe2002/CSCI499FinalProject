Upon reviewing the code, I believe there is a bug in the logic within the nested while loop. The loop is intended to count the number of odd numbers in the subarray from i to j and increment the count of temp accordingly. However, the condition for the nested while loop (odd == k) may result in an infinite loop when the count of odd numbers exceeds k. 

To fix this bug, we need to introduce an additional condition to exit the nested while loop when odd exceeds k, and also update the value of temp when that happens. 

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
// Runtime: 12 ms (Top 87.36%) | Memory: 150.4 MB (Top 41.15%)
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubarrays(int[] nums, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int odd = 0;
        int result = 0;
        int temp = 0;

        while (j < nums.length) {
            if (nums[j] % 2 != 0) {
                odd++;
                temp = 0;
            }
            while (odd > k) { // Exit the nested loop when odd exceeds k
                if (nums[i] % 2 != 0)
                    odd--;
                i++;
            }
            while (odd == k) {
                temp++;
                if (nums[i] % 2 != 0)
                    odd--;
                i++;
            }
            result += temp;
            j++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

By introducing the condition `odd > k` in the nested loop, we prevent it from running indefinitely and causing an incorrect result.
