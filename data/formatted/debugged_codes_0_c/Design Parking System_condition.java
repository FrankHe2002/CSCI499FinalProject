Bug type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning process:
1. The provided code is a class named "ParkingSystem".
2. The class has a private instance variable named "size" of type int array.
3. The constructor of the class takes three integer parameters: big, medium, and small.
4. The constructor initializes the "size" array with the provided values.
5. The class has a method named "addCar" which takes an integer parameter named "carType".
6. In the method, the "carType" value is used as an index to access the elements of the "size" array.
7. The expression "carType - 1" is used as the index for the "size" array.
8. If the value of "carType" is less than 1 or greater than the length of the "size" array, it will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:
1. We need to check if the "carType" value is within the valid range of array indices before accessing the "size" array.
2. We can add a condition to check if "carType" is less than 1 or greater than the length of the "size" array and return false in such cases.

Updated code:

```java
class ParkingSystem {
    private int[] size;

    public ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) {
        this.size = new int[] {big, medium, small};
    }

    public boolean addCar(int carType) {
        if (carType < 1 || carType > size.length) {
            return false;
        }
        return size[carType - 1]-- <= 0;
    }
}
```
