The code seems to have a bug. 

The bug is in the inner for loop where the participants are rotated `k-1` times. The intention of this loop is to rotate the participants to simulate the elimination process. However, the current implementation rotates the participants `k-1` times, which is one less than the desired number of rotations. This means that the participant who should have been eliminated is not being correctly removed from the list.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition of the inner for loop from `j < k - 1` to `j < k`. This will ensure that the participants are rotated `k` times, as desired.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        LinkedList<Integer> participants = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            participants.add(i);
        }

        int lastKilled = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                participants.add(participants.poll());
            }
            lastKilled = participants.poll();
        }
        return lastKilled;
    }
}
```
