Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The bug is identified through compilation error. The code has a syntax error in the line:
```java
Integer[][] dp = new Integer[n][n;
```
The closing square bracket is missing.

Fix: Add the missing closing square bracket.

```java
Integer[][] dp = new Integer[n][n];
```
