The provided Java code has a bug in the `getProduct` method. Here is the bug and how to identify and fix it:

Bug type: Division by zero (ArithmeticException)

Reasoning:
1. The `prefix` list is initialized with a single element, `1`, when the `ProductOfNumbers` object is created.
2. In the `add` method, whenever `num` is equal to 0, the `prefix` list is cleared and a `1` is added as the only element.
3. The bug occurs in the `getProduct` method when `k` is equal to the size of the `prefix` list. In this case, we try to access `prefix.get(prefix.size() - k - 1)`, which translates to `prefix.get(0)`. However, when `prefix` is cleared and only `1` is added, the size of `prefix` becomes 1. Hence, trying to access the 0th index will result in a division by zero error.

To fix the bug, I will update the `getProduct` method to return 1 when `k` is equal to or greater than the size of `prefix`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class ProductOfNumbers {
    List<Integer> prefix;

    public ProductOfNumbers() {
        prefix = new ArrayList<>();
        prefix.add(1);
    }

    public void add(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            prefix.clear();
            prefix.add(1);
        } else {
            prefix.add(num * prefix.get(prefix.size() - 1));
        }
    }

    public int getProduct(int k) {
        if (k >= prefix.size()) {
            return 1;
        }
        return prefix.get(prefix.size() - 1) / prefix.get(prefix.size() - k - 1);
    }
}
```
