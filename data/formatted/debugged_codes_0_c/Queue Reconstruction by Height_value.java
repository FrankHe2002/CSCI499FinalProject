Bug Type: Incorrect sorting logic

Reasoning Process:
1. The code sorts the input array `people` in descending order of height (`a[0]`) and ascending order of k-value (`b[1]`).
2. The sorting is done using a lambda expression.
3. The lambda expression compares two elements `a` and `b` based on their heights and k-values, and returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on the comparison.
4. However, there is an error in the comparison logic where it compares `a[0]` with `b[1]` instead of `a[1]` with `b[1]`.
5. This error leads to incorrect sorting of the `people` array.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the lambda expression. We should compare `a[1]` with `b[1]` instead of `a[0]` with `b[1]`. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>(); //return value

        Arrays.sort(people, (a, b) -> {
            int x = Integer.compare(b[0], a[0]);
            if (x == 0) return Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]); // Fix: Compare a[1] with b[1]
            else return x;
        });

        for (int[] p : people)
            result.add(p[1], p);

        return result.toArray(new int[people.length][2]);
    }
}
```
