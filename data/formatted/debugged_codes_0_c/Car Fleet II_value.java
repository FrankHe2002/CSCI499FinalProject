Bug type: Logic Error

There is a logic error in the code that causes incorrect calculation of the catch time between cars. The catch time is calculated as the distance between the cars divided by the relative velocity, but the velocity is incorrectly calculated as the difference between the velocities of the cars. The correct calculation should be the difference in velocities divided by the difference in distances.

To fix the bug, the catchTime() method should be updated to calculate the velocity correctly. Here's the updated code:

```java
// Runtime: 40 ms (Top 65.78%) | Memory: 229.1 MB (Top 68.82%)
class Solution {
    public double[] getCollisionTimes(int[][] cars) {
        int n = cars.length;
        double[] res = new double[n];
        Arrays.fill(res, - 1.0);

        Deque<Integer> stack = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int[] c1 = cars[i];
            while (! stack.isEmpty()) {
                int j = stack.peekLast();
                int[] c2 = cars[j];

                if (c1[1] > c2[1] && (res[j] == - 1.0 || catchTime(cars, i, j) <= res[j])) {
                    res[i] = catchTime(cars, i, j);
                    break;
                }

                stack.pollLast();
            }
            stack.offerLast(i);
        }
        return res;
    }

    // time for cars[i] to catch cars[j]
    private double catchTime(int[][] cars, int i, int j) {
        int dist = cars[j][0] - cars[i][0];
        int v = cars[j][1] - cars[i][1]; // Fix: Calculate relative velocity correctly

        return (double) dist / v;
    }
}
```
