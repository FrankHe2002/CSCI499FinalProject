The bug in the provided Java code is that the regular expression used in the `replaceAll` method is incorrect. 

The regular expression `[a-zA/Z]` is used to match any lowercase letter (`a-z`), a forward slash (`/`), or an uppercase letter (`A-Z`), which is not intended. Instead, the regular expression should be `[a-zA-Z]` to match any alphabetic character.

To fix the bug, we need to change the regular expression in the `replaceAll` method. Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numDifferentIntegers(String word) {
        String[] arr = word.replaceAll("[a-zA-Z]", " ").split("\\s+");
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<String>();

        for (String str : arr) {
            if (! str.isEmpty())
                set.add(String.valueOf(str.replaceAll("^0*", "")));
        }

        return set.size();
    }
}
```

The regular expression `[a-zA-Z]` matches any alphabetic character (`a-z` or `A-Z`), and the code will now correctly replace the alphabetic characters with a space before splitting the string into an array.
