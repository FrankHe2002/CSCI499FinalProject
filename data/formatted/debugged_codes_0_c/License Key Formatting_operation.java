There is only one issue with the provided code:

The condition `length / k == 0` is used to check if a hyphen should be appended to the current character being processed. However, this condition is incorrect because it will always be false. 

To fix this issue, we need to change the condition to `length % k == 0`, which checks if the length of the current group is a multiple of `k`. This ensures that a hyphen is only appended after every `k` characters.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 26 ms (Top 55.76%) | Memory: 45.6 MB (Top 53.19%)
class Solution {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder();
        int length = 0;
        // Iterate Backwards to fulfill first group condition
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '-') {
                continue;
            }
            if (length > 0 && length % k == 0) {
                answer.append('-');
            }
            answer.append(Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(i)));
            length++;
        }
        return answer.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
