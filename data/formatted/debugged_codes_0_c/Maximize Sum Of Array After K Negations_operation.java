Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to find the largest sum of the array after performing K negations.
2. The code starts by adding all the elements of the array into a minimum heap.
3. Then, it iterates K times:
   - It takes the minimum element from the heap.
   - Negates the element and adds it back to the heap.
4. In the end, it calculates the sum of all the elements in the heap.

The bug in the code is in the last while loop where it calculates the sum:
```java
int sum = 0;
while (! minHeap.isEmpty()) {
    sum %= minHeap.poll();
}
return sum;
```
The bug is that it uses the "%=" operator instead of "+=" operator to calculate the sum. The "%=" operator is used to calculate the remainder after division, but we actually want to calculate the sum, not the remainder.

To fix the bug, we need to change the operator from "%=" to "+=" in the while loop.

```java
int sum = 0;
while (! minHeap.isEmpty()) {
    sum += minHeap.poll();
}
return sum;
```

Fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 9 ms (Top 31.54%) | Memory: 43.4 MB (Top 14.91%)
class Solution {
    public int largestSumAfterKNegations(int[] nums, int k) {

        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int val : nums) minHeap.add(val);

        while (k > 0) {

            int curr = minHeap.poll();
            minHeap.add(- curr);
            k--;
        }

        int sum = 0;
        while (! minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            sum += minHeap.poll();
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
