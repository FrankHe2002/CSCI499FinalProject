The provided Java code is calculating the minimum number of deletions required to make the array "nums" sorted in non-decreasing order. The logic of the code seems correct, but there is a bug in the calculation of the minimum number of deletions.

The bug is in the following two lines:
```java
int count = Math.min(maxInd + 1, n - minInd);
int count1 = minInd + 1 + (n - maxInd);
```

The count variable should represent the minimum number of elements to be deleted to the left of the minimum element and to the right of the maximum element. But in the calculation, it is taking the left side of the minimum element and the right side of the maximum element, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to swap the variables maxInd and minInd in the above lines.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(int[] nums) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minInd = 0;
        int maxInd = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        //First Find out the max and min element index
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > max) {
                max = nums[i];
                maxInd = i;
            }

            if (nums[i] <= min) {
                min = nums[i];
                minInd = i;
            }
        }

        //if both index are same then return the part in which less number of elements are there
        if (maxInd == minInd) {
            return Math.min(maxInd + 1, n - maxInd);
        }

        //max element is right side of min element
        if (maxInd > minInd) {
            int count = Math.min(minInd + 1, n - maxInd); // min of all the elements to the left of min element and to the right of max element
            int count1 = maxInd + 1 + (n - minInd); // all elements to the left of max and right of min
            return Math.min(count, count1); // min of both
        }
        // min element is right side of the max element
        else {
            int count = Math.min(maxInd + 1, n - minInd);
            int count1 = minInd + 1 + (n - maxInd
