Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning process:

1. The code initializes three variables:
   - `result` to store the length of the longest subarray
   - `length` to store the current length of the subarray being traversed
   - `max` to store the maximum element in the `nums` array
   
2. The first for loop iterates through the `nums` array to find the maximum element and assigns it to `max`.

3. The second for loop iterates through the `nums` array again and checks if the current element is equal to `max`. If it is, it increments the `length` variable and updates the `result` if necessary. If it is not, it resets the `length` variable to 0.

4. The bug is that in the else statement of the second for loop, the `length` variable is set to 0. However, this should be done only if the current element is not equal to `max`. If the current element is equal to `max`, the `length` variable should not be reset to 0.

Fix:

To fix the bug, modify the else statement in the second for loop to only reset the `length` variable to 0 if the current element is not equal to `max`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0, length = 0, max = 0;
        for (int ele : nums) {
            max = Math.max(max, ele);
        }

        for (int ele : nums) {
            if (ele == max) {
                result = Math.max(result, ++length);
            } else {
                length = (ele != max) ? 0 : length;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
