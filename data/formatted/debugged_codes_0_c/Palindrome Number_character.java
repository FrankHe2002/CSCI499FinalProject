The bug in the provided Java code is a missing semicolon at line 7. 

To identify the bug, we need to analyze the code and understand its purpose.

The code is trying to determine whether an integer `x` is a palindrome or not. To do so, it reverses the digits of `x` and checks if the reversed number is equal to the original number.

Here are the steps to identify the bug:

1. The code initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the reversed number.
2. Since we need to compare the reversed number with the original number at the end, we store the original number in a different variable `X`.
3. The code enters a while loop, where it repeatedly takes the rightmost digit of `x` (using `x % 10`) and appends it to `sum` by multiplying `sum` by 10 and adding the digit. It also divides `x` by 10 to remove the rightmost digit.
4. Once the loop ends, the code checks if `sum` is equal to `X` and returns the result.

Now that we understand the code and its purpose, we can see that the missing semicolon at line 7 would cause a compilation error. 

To fix the bug, we simply need to add a semicolon after `int X = x` at line 7. Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 39.53%) | Memory: 44.7 MB (Top 53.62%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int sum = 0;
        int X = x;

        while (x > 0) {
            sum = 10 * sum + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        return sum == X;
    }
}
```
