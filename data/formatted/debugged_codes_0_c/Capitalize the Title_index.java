Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:
1. The code attempts to convert the characters in the input string to title case.
2. It iterates through each character in the string.
3. When it encounters a non-space character, it converts it to lowercase.
4. Then, it checks if the length of the word (characters until the next space) is greater than 2.
5. If it is, it converts the first character of the word to uppercase.

Bug Explanation:
In the while loop condition, there is a typo where `ch[MB]` should be `ch[i]`. This causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` since `MB` is not a valid index in the `ch` array. This bug prevents the code from correctly capitalizing the title.

Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change `ch[MB]` to `ch[i]` in the while loop condition.

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.1%) | Memory: 41.07 MB (Top 90.8%)

class Solution {
    public String capitalizeTitle(String title) {

        char[] ch = title.toCharArray();
        int len = ch.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++ i) {

            int firstIndex = i; // store the first index of the word

            while (i < len && ch[i] != ' ') {
                ch[i] = Character.toLowerCase(ch[i]); // converting the character at ith index to lower case ony by one
                ++ i;
            }

            // if word is of length greater than 2, then turn the first character of the word to upper case
            if (i - firstIndex > 2) {
                ch[firstIndex] = Character.toUpperCase(ch[firstIndex]); // converting the first character of the word to upper case
            }
        }

        return String.valueOf(ch); // return the final result by converting the char array into string
    }
}
```

Now, the bug is fixed and the code should correctly capitalize the title.
