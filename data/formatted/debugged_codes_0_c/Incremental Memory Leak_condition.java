The bug in the provided Java code is in the while loop condition. 

Currently, the condition `Math.max(memory1, memory2) <= i` is checking if the maximum value between `memory1` and `memory2` is less than or equal to `i`. This condition will always evaluate to false when `i` is initially set to 1.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `Math.max(memory1, memory2) >= i`. This new condition will check if the maximum value between `memory1` and `memory2` is greater than or equal to `i`, which makes more sense in the context of the problem description.

Here's the fixed code with the minimal changes applied:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int i = 1;
        while (Math.max(memory1, memory2) >= i) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2)
                memory1 -= i;
            else
                memory2 -= i;
            i++;
        }
        return new int[] {i, memory1, memory2};
    }
}
```

This fix will correctly calculate the number of seconds `i` it takes for one of the memories to be exhausted, and return the remaining values of `memory1` and `memory2`.
