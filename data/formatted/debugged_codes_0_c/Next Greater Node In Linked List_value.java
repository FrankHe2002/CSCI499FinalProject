The code seems to have a bug in the inner while loop. It is only updating the `res[i]` value when it finds a larger value, but it should actually update the value for each node in the linked list.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `res[i]` with a value of 0 before entering the inner loop, and then update `res[i]` with the `max` value after the inner loop ends.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextLargerNodes(ListNode head) {
        ListNode length = head;
        int l = 0;
        while (length != null) {
            length = length.next;
            l++;
        }
        int[] res = new int[l];
        int i = 0;
        ListNode temp = head;

        while (temp != null) {
            ListNode temp1 = temp.next;
            int max = temp.val;

            while (temp1 != null) {
                if (temp1.val > max) {
                    max = temp1.val;
                }

                temp1 = temp1.next;
            }
            res[i] = max;
            temp = temp.next;
            i++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code should correctly find the next larger value for each node in the linked list.
