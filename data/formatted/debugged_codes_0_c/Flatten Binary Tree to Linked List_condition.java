There is a bug in the provided Java code. 

The bug is in the `while` loop condition. Currently, the condition is `while (curr == null)`, which means the loop will only execute if `curr` is null. However, the intention is to execute the loop as long as `curr` is not null. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition from `while (curr == null)` to `while (curr != null)`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.left != null) {
                TreeNode prev = curr.left;
                while (prev.right != null)
                    prev = prev.right;
                prev.right = curr.right;
                curr.right = curr.left;
                curr.left = null;
            }
            curr = curr.right;
        }
    }
}
```

The bug was identified by carefully analyzing the code and comparing it with the intended logic. The fix was implemented by modifying the condition in the `while` loop to the correct one.
