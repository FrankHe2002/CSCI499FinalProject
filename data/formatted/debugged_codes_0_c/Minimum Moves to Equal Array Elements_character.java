Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code calculates the minimum value of the array and stores it in the variable 'min'.
2. It then subtracts 'min' from each element in the array 'nums' and adds the result to the 'count' variable.
3. Finally, it returns the value of 'count'.

Based on this reasoning process, the bug in the code is that it is not correctly calculating the minimum moves needed to make all elements in the array equal. The logic used to calculate 'count' is incorrect. Subtracting 'min' from each element is not a valid way to calculate the moves needed to make all elements equal.

To fix the bug, the correct logic should be employed.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i : nums)
            min = Math.min(i, min);
        
        for (int i : nums) {
            sum += i - min;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The variable 'count' has been renamed to 'sum' for clarity.
2. Instead of using a traditional for loop with an index, a foreach loop has been used for simplicity and readability.
3. The correct logic for calculating the sum of differences between each element and the minimum value has been implemented.
