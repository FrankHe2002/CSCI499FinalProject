Upon reviewing the code, the logic appears to be correct and there doesn't seem to be any obvious bugs in the code. 

The code uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings, `text1` and `text2`. It initializes a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m+1` and `n+1`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `text1` and `text2` respectively. 

The nested for loop iterates over each character in `text1` and `text2`. If the characters at `text1[i-1]` and `text2[j-1]` are the same, the value of `dp[i][j]` is set to `1` plus the value of `dp[i-1][j-1]`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value between `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`.

Finally, the value at `dp[m][n]` is returned, which represents the length of the longest common subsequence between `text1` and `text2`. 

Based on this analysis, there appears to be no bugs in the code and it should work as intended.
