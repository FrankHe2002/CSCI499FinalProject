Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
- The code is supposed to find the numbers that appear in at least two of the three input arrays.
- The code uses a bit manipulation approach to keep track of which numbers appear in each array.
- The code then checks if a number has appeared in at least two arrays by checking if its bit representation is 0b111.
- However, there is a bug in the for loop that iterates over the `bits` array:
  - The loop condition is incorrect: `i < 0` should be `i >= 0` to ensure that all elements of the `bits` array are visited.
  - As a result, the loop never executes and the `result` list is always empty.

Fix:
- Change the loop condition from `i < 0` to `i >= 0`.

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> twoOutOfThree(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int[] nums3) {
        int[] bits = new int[101];
        for (int n : nums1) bits[n] |= 0b110;
        for (int n : nums2) bits[n] |= 0b101;
        for (int n : nums3) bits[n] |= 0b011;
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = bits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            if (bits[i] == 0b111)
                result.add(i);
        return result;
    }
}
