Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code uses a variable "blockActive" to keep track of whether or not we are within a block comment. The variable is initially set to false.
2. The code iterates through each line in the source input.
3. For each line, the code checks if it is part of a block comment. If it is part of a block comment, it skips the implicit newline characters.
4. If the line is not part of a block comment, the code checks if the current character is the start of a regular comment or a block comment. If it is neither, it appends the character to a StringBuilder.
5. If the line is part of a block comment, the code checks for the closing of the block comment and updates the blockActive variable accordingly.
6. After processing each line, the code appends the contents of the StringBuilder to the result list if the line is not part of a block comment and the StringBuilder is not empty.
7. Finally, the code returns the result list.

Bug: The logic for checking the closing of a block comment is incorrect. 

- The code checks if the current character is '-' and the next character is '/'. However, the correct character to check is '*'. This means that the closing of a block comment will not be correctly detected, resulting in incorrect removal of block comments.

Fix: Change the condition from "c == '-'" to "c == '*'".

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> removeComments(String[] source) {
        boolean blockActive = false;

        List<String> result = new ArrayList<String>();
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();

        for (String line : source) {
            if (! blockActive) {
                builder = new StringBuilder();
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < line.length(); i++) {
                char c = line.charAt(i);
                if (! blockActive) {
                    if (c == '/') {
                        if (i < line.length() - 1 && line.charAt(i + 1) == '/') {
                            break;
                        } else if (i < line.length() - 1 && line.charAt(i + 1) == '*') {
                            i++;
                            blockActive = true;
                        } else {
                            builder.append(c);
                        }
                    } else {
                        builder.append(c);
                    }
                } else {
                    if (c == '*') { // Change the condition from "c == '-'" to "c
