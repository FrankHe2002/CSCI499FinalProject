Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning Process:
- The code is trying to group words based on their special equivalence. Two words are considered special equivalent if they have the same characters on even indices and the same characters on odd indices, even if the characters are in different positions.
- The code uses two HashMaps `evens` and `odds` to count the characters on even and odd indices of each word.
- The code then compares the counts of characters in `evens` and `odds` for each word and checks if they are empty after reducing the counts for each character encountered in the second string.
- If the counts in both `evens` and `odds` are empty at the end, the two strings are considered special equivalent and are grouped together.
- The code tracks the grouped strings using the `isGrouped` array. If a string is grouped, its corresponding index in the `isGrouped` array is set to `true`.
- The code uses a hashmap `hashmap` to store the count of words in each group.
- Finally, the code returns the size of the `hashmap` which represents the total number of special equivalent groups.

Bug:
- The bug in the code is that the `isGrouped` array is not being updated correctly.
- The `isGrouped` array is intended to keep track of the strings that have been grouped and should be skipped in the inner loop.
- However, the code is currently setting `isGrouped[j] = true` for the wrong index inside the inner loop.
- It should actually be setting `isGrouped[index] = true` to mark the `word` as grouped.

Fix:
- To fix the bug, change `isGrouped[j] = true;` to `isGrouped[index] = true;` inside the inner loop. This will correctly mark the word as grouped so that it is skipped in the future iterations of the outer loop.

class Solution {
    public int numSpecialEquivGroups(String[] words) {
        if (words.length == 0 || words.length == 1) return words.length;

        // To store group sizes
        HashMap<String, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<>();

        // To mark the strings already part of some groups
        boolean[] isGrouped = new boolean[words.length];
