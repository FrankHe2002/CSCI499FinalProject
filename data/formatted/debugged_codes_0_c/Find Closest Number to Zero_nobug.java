The code appears to have a bug. The bug occurs when the absolute value of a number is the same as the current minimum value (min), but the number (n) is smaller than the current closest_num. In this case, the code should update the closest_num to be the smaller number, not the larger number.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition in the second `else if` statement. Instead of checking if closest_num < n, we should check if closest_num > n. This way, if we find a number with the same absolute value as min but smaller than closest_num, we update the closest_num to be the smaller number.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findClosestNumber(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int closest_num = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (Math.abs(n) < min) {
                min = Math.abs(n);
                closest_num = n;
            } else if (Math.abs(n) == min && closest_num > n) {
                closest_num = n;
            }
        }
        return closest_num;
    }
}
```

Now, the code will correctly update the closest_num to be the smaller number when the absolute value is the same as the current minimum value.
