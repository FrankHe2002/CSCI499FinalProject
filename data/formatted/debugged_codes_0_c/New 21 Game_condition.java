The bug in the provided code is in the second for loop where it iterates from k to k + maxPts. This loop will not execute if k + maxPts is greater than n, which means it will not consider all the possible points that can be obtained.  

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition in the second for loop to iterate until min(k + maxPts, n) instead of just k + maxPts. This will ensure that the loop considers all the points within the required range.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
        double[] dp = new double[k + maxPts];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= maxPts; j++) {
                dp[i + j] += dp[i] * 1.0 / maxPts;
            }
        }

        double ans = 0;
        for (int i = k; i <= Math.min(k + maxPts, n); i++) {
            ans += dp[i];
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
