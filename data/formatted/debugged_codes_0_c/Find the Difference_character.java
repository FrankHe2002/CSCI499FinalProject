Bug type: Syntax error

Reasoning process:
1. When reviewing the code, it is observed that there is a syntax error in the for loop on line 4.
2. The syntax error is due to the missing closing parenthesis ")" after `s.toCharArray()`.
3. This causes a compilation error, and the code cannot be executed until the syntax error is fixed.

Fix:
Add the missing closing parenthesis ")" after `s.toCharArray()` in line 4.

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for (char cs : s.toCharArray()) c ^= cs;
        for (char ct : t.toCharArray()) c ^= ct;
        return c;
    }
}
```
