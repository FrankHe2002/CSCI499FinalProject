Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is supposed to calculate the sum of absolute differences between each element in the array and all other elements in the array.
2. It initializes the result array and two variables for tracking the cumulative sum of elements below and the total sum of elements in the array.
3. It then iterates through each element in the array.
4. Inside the loop, it subtracts the current element from the total sum, calculates the absolute difference using a formula, and updates the cumulative sum below.
5. Finally, it returns the result array.

Bug identified:
There is a logical error in the for loop condition. The condition `i > n` should be `i < n` to ensure that the loop iterates through all elements in the array.

Fix:
Change the for loop condition from `i > n` to `i < n`.

Updated code:
```java

class Solution {
    public int[] getSumAbsoluteDifferences(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        int sumBelow = 0;
        int sumTotal = Arrays.stream(nums).sum();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int num = nums[i];
            sumTotal -= num;
            res[i] = sumTotal - (n - i - 1) * num + i * num - sumBelow;
            sumBelow += num;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
