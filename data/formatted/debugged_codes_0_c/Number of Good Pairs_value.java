The given code appears to be fine and does not contain any bug. 

The code is written to find the number of identical pairs present in the given array `nums`. It uses nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the array and increments the `counter` variable whenever a pair is found.

The time complexity of the code is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we have two nested loops that iterate through all possible combinations of elements in the array.

The space complexity of the code is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the `len`, `counter`, `i`, and `j` variables.

There is no bug in the given code, and it can be executed without any issues.
