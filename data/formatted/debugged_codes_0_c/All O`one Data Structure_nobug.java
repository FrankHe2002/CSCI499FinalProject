There is a bug in the code. 

The bug occurs in the `inc()` method. When incrementing the count of a key, if there is no bucket for the new count, the code creates a new bucket and adds it to the right of the old bucket. However, if the old bucket is the tail of the bucket list (i.e. the maximum count bucket), the new bucket is not added correctly to the right.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `inc()` method. After creating the new bucket, we need to check if the old bucket is the tail of the bucket list. If it is, we need to update the tail of the bucket list to point to the new bucket.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
public void inc(String key) {
    if (!stringToBucket.containsKey(key)) { 
        Bucket bucket = null;

        if (!countToBucket.containsKey(1)) { 
            bucket = bucketList.createNewBucket(key);
        } else { 
            bucket = countToBucket.get(1);
            bucket.keys.add(key);
        }

        stringToBucket.put(key, bucket);
        countToBucket.put(1, bucket);

        // Check if the old bucket is the tail of the bucket list
        if (bucketList.dummyTail.prev == bucket) {
            bucketList.dummyTail.prev = bucket.next;
        }
    } else { 
        Bucket oldBucket = stringToBucket.get(key);
        Bucket newBucket = null;

        int count = oldBucket.count;
        count++; 
        oldBucket.keys.remove(key);

        if (countToBucket.containsKey(count)) {
            newBucket = countToBucket.get(count);
            newBucket.keys.add(key);
        } else { 
            newBucket = bucketList.createBucketToTheRight(oldBucket, key, count);

            // Check if the old bucket is the tail of the bucket list
            if (bucketList.dummyTail.prev == oldBucket) {
                bucketList.dummyTail.prev = newBucket;
            }
        }

        if (bucketList.clean(oldBucket)) {
            countToBucket.remove(oldBucket.count);
        }

        stringToBucket.put(key, newBucket);
        countToBucket.putIfAbsent(count, newBucket);
    }
}
```

By adding the check and update for the tail of the bucket list, we ensure that the tail is always correctly updated when a new bucket is added to the right of the old bucket.
