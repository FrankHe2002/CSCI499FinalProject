There is a bug in the provided code:

```java
if (map[num >= 3) result += 1;
```

The closing parenthesis is misplaced. It should be after `num`:

```java
if (map[num] >= 3) result += 1;
```

To fix the bug, we need to place the closing parenthesis in the correct position.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int arithmeticTriplets(int[] nums, int diff) {
        int result = 0;
        int[] map = new int[201];

        for (int num : nums) {
            map[num] = 1;

            if (num - diff >= 0) {
                map[num] += map[num - diff];
            }

            if (map[num] >= 3) result += 1;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
