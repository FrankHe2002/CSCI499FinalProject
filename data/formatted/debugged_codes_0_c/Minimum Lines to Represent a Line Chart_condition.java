The bug in the provided code lies in the condition `if (stockPrices.length != 1) return 0;`. This condition is checking if the length of the `stockPrices` array is not equal to 1, and if so, it returns 0. However, according to the given code logic, it seems that this condition should actually check if the length is equal to 1 and return 0 in that case.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition from `if (stockPrices.length != 1)` to `if (stockPrices.length == 1)`. This will ensure that the correct condition is being checked and the code will return 0 only if the length is equal to 1.

Here is the fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 57 ms (Top 71.43%) | Memory: 109.9 MB (Top 23.21%)
class Solution {
    public int minimumLines(int[][] stockPrices) {
        if (stockPrices.length == 1) return 0;
        int count = 1;
        Arrays.sort(stockPrices, (o1, o2) -> o1[0] - o2[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < stockPrices.length - 1; i++) {
            int x1 = stockPrices[i - 1][0];
            int y1 = stockPrices[i - 1][1];
            int x2 = stockPrices[i][0];
            int y2 = stockPrices[i][1];
            int x3 = stockPrices[i + 1][0];
            int y3 = stockPrices[i + 1][1];
            if (((x3 - x2) * (y2 - y1)) == ((y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1))) continue;

            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
