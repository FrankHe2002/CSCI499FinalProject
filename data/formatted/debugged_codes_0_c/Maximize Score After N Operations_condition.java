The provided Java code calculates the maximum score that can be obtained by selecting subsets of elements from the given array, such that the sum of their greatest common divisors (GCDs) is maximized. 

To identify the bug in the code, we need to understand the logic and functionality of the code. The code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

The bug in the code lies in the calculation of the GCD values. In the inner loop where `gcdVal` map is populated, the bitwise OR operation `(1 << i) + (1 << j)` is used as the key for the map. However, the correct operation to use is the bitwise XOR operation `(1 << i) ^ (1 << j)`. This is because the XOR operation creates a unique combination of bits for each pair (i, j), while the OR operation can create duplicate combinations.

To fix the bug, we need to change the OR operation to XOR operation in the `gcdVal.put()` statement.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScore(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        Map<Integer, Integer> gcdVal = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++ i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++ j) {
                gcdVal.put((1 << i) ^ (1 << j), gcd(nums[i], nums[j]));
            }
        }

        int[] dp = new int[1 << n];

        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); ++ i) {
            int bits = Integer.bitCount(i); // how many numbers are used
            if (bits % 2 == 0) // odd numbers, skip it
                continue;
            for (int k : gcdVal.keySet()) {
                if ((k & i) != 0) // overlapping used numbers
                    continue;
                dp[i ^ k] = Math.max(dp[i ^ k], dp[i] + gcdVal.get(k) * (bits / 2 + 1));
            }
        }

        return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
    }

    public int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0)
            return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}

// Time: O(2^n * n^2)
// Space: O(2 ^ n)
