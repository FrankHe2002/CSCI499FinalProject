The bug in the provided Java code is in the loop that iterates over the digits of the given number. 

The code attempts to find the maximum number by replacing each digit of the number with either 6 or 9, and comparing it with the current maximum. However, it does not correctly restore the original number after replacing a digit.

To fix the bug, we need to move the line `String s = String.valueOf(num);` inside the loop so that a fresh string representation of the number is created for each iteration. This ensures that the original number is restored before replacing another digit.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximum69Number(int num) {
        int i;
        int max = num;

        for (i = 0; i < String.valueOf(num).length(); i++) {
            String s = String.valueOf(num);
            char c[] = s.toCharArray();
            if (c[i] != '9') {
                c[i] = '9';
            } else {
                c[i] = '6';
            }
            String p = new String(c);
            int k = Integer.parseInt(p);
            max = Math.max(max, k);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, the string representation of the number `num` is created inside the loop, ensuring that it is fresh for each iteration. The bug is fixed, and the code now correctly finds the maximum number by replacing a single digit.
