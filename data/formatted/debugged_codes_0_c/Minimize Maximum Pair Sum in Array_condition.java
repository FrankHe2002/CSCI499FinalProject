The bug in the provided code is in the for-loop condition. The condition `i >= nums.length / 2` is incorrect because it will always evaluate to false since `i` is initialized to 0. Therefore, the loop will never execute and the maximum pair sum will always be `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.

To fix this bug, we should change the condition to `i < nums.length / 2` so that the loop executes for `n/2` iterations, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This will allow us to consider pairs from both ends of the sorted array and find the maximum sum.

Here is the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPairSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int output = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        //This is greedy, so n/2 pairs must be from start and end and move inwards
        for (int i = 0, j = nums.length - 1; i < nums.length / 2; i++, j--) {
            output = Math.max(output, nums[i] + nums[j]);
        }

        return output;
    }
}
```

After fixing the bug, the code will iterate correctly for `n/2` iterations, considering pairs from both ends of the sorted array. The maximum pair sum will be calculated correctly and returned as the output.
