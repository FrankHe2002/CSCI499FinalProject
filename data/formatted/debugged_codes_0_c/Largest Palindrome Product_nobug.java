There doesn't seem to be any bug in the code. The code simply returns pre-defined values based on the input `n`. However, the code could be improved by using a switch statement instead of multiple if statements for better readability. Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int largestPalindrome(int n) {
        switch (n) {
            case 1: return 9;
            case 2: return 987;
            case 3: return 123;
            case 4: return 597;
            case 5: return 677;
            case 6: return 1218;
            case 7: return 877;
            default: return 475;
        }
    }
}
```
