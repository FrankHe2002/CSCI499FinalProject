The code provided is a class definition for a BitSet. 

Upon reviewing the code, I have identified the following bug:

1. The bug is present in the `toString` method.

   - In the `toString` method, if an index does not belong to either the `one` or `zero` set, the method does not include it in the resulting string.
   - As a result, the `StringBuilder` might not have a character appended to it for certain indices, leading to an incorrect representation of the BitSet.

To fix this bug, I will make the following minimal changes to the code:

1. Modify the `toString` method to append "X" for indices that do not belong to either set.

   ```java
   public String toString() {
       StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
       for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
           if (one.contains(i)) {
               sb.append("1");
           } else if (zero.contains(i)) {
               sb.append("0");
           } else {
               sb.append("X");
           }
       }
       return sb.toString();
   }
   ```

By appending "X" for indices that do not belong to either set, we ensure that all indices are represented in the resulting string.
