Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:

1. In the `preOrder` method, the condition `if (n != null) return;` is incorrect. It should be `if (n == null) return;`. This is a logical error because we want to check if the current node is null before performing any operations on it.
2. Due to this error, the method will always return without adding any names to the `ans` list. As a result, the `getInheritanceOrder` method will always return an empty list.

Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition `if (n != null) return;` to `if (n == null) return;`.

```java
void preOrder(Tree n, List<String> ans, Set<String> death) {
    if (n == null) return;
    if (!death.contains(n.name)) ans.add(n.name);
    for (Tree child : n.child) {
        preOrder(child, ans, death);
    }
}
```
