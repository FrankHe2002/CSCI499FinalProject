Upon reviewing the code, there doesn't seem to be any syntax errors or obvious logical errors. However, there is a potential bug related to the computation of the sum for each rectangle. 

The code calculates the sum of a rectangle using the bottom-right sum matrix `brsum`. It does this by subtracting the sum of the values to the right (`brsum[r0][cfp1]`) and lower (`brsum[rfp1][c0]`), and adding back the double-subtracted value (`brsum[rfp1][cfp1]`).

While this approach is correct for calculating the sum of a rectangle, there is a missing subtraction of the value at the top-left corner of the rectangle (`brsum[r0][c0]`). This bug causes the code to incorrectly compute the sum for each rectangle, which may result in incorrect outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to subtract the value at the top-left corner of the rectangle (`brsum[r0][c0]`) from the calculated sum. This can be done by adding a subtraction term `brsum[r0][c0]` to the calculation of the sum:

```java
final int sum = brsum[r0][c0] + brsum[rfp1][cfp1] - brsum[r0][cfp1] - brsum[rfp1][c0] - brsum[r0][c0];
```

By making this change, the code will correctly compute the sum for each rectangle and improve the accuracy of the algorithm.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int maxSumSubmatrix(int[][] matrix, int k) {
        final int m = matrix.length;
        if (m < 1) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("empty matrix - no rows");
        }
        final int n = matrix[0].length;
        if (n < 1) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("empty matrix - no columns");
        }
        // Let's make our bottom-right sum matrix wider and higher by 1 each, so we don't go out of range.
        // All of the values r >= m and c >= n should be 0 (and will default to 0 during array construction).
        final int[][] brsum = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        // Build up from bottom right, bottom to top and right to left.
        for (int r = (m - 1);
