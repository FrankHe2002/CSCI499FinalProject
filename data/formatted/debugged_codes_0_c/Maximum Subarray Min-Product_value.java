Bug type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning process:

1. The code is using two stacks, 'left' and 'right', to store the indices of the next smaller elements on the left and right side, respectively.
2. The first for loop is filling the 'left' stack correctly. It starts from the second element and checks if the current element is smaller than the top element of the stack.
3. If the current element is smaller, it pops elements from the stack until either the stack is empty or the top element is smaller than the current element. It then stores the index of the top element as the next smaller on the left.
4. The first for loop ends once all elements have been processed.
5. The second for loop is supposed to fill the 'right' stack in a similar manner, but there is a mistake in the loop condition: 
   `for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)`
   The loop condition should be `i >= 0`, not `i > 0`, because we need to process the first element as well.
6. The incorrect loop condition causes the last element to be skipped, resulting in an 'Index Out of Bounds' bug.
7. The bug can be fixed by changing the loop condition to `i >= 0`.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSumMinProduct(int[] nums) {
        int mod = (int) Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;
        int n = nums.length;

        //next smaller on left
        int[] left = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
        left[0] = -1;
        st.push(0);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            while (st.size() > 0 && nums[st.peek()] >= nums[i]) {
                st.pop();
            }

            if (st.size() == 0) left[i] = -1;
            else left[i] = st.peek();

            st.push(i);
        }

        //next smaller on right
        int[] right = new int[n];
        st = new Stack<>();
        right[n - 1] = n;
        st.push(n - 1);
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (st.size() > 0 && nums[st.peek()] >= nums[i]) st
