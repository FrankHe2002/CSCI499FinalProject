The bug in this code is a compilation error. 

Upon carefully examining the code, we can identify the following issues:

1. The variable name `road[ms]` is incorrect. It should be `road[0]`.
2. The `Arrays` class is not imported, so the `Arrays.sort()` method cannot be used.

To fix these issues, we can make the following changes:

```java
// Runtime: 28 ms (Top 55.58%) | Memory: 124.3 MB (Top 45.11%)
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long maximumImportance(int n, int[][] roads) {
        long ans = 0, x = 1;
        long degree[] = new long[n];
        for (int road[] : roads) {
            degree[road[0]]++;
            degree[road[1]]++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(degree);
        for (long i : degree) ans += i * (x++);
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Now the code should compile and run correctly.
