Bug Type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the factorial of n, but the loop condition is `i < n` instead of `i <= n`.
2. As a result, the last iteration is skipped, and the last permutation number (n) is not added to the `nums` list.
3. This bug causes the returned string to be incomplete and incorrect.

To fix the bug, change the loop condition from `i < n` to `i <= n`:

```java
class Solution {
    public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        int fact = 1;
        List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // Fix: Change loop condition to i <= n
            fact = fact * i;
            nums.add(i);
        }
        String res = "";
        k = k - 1; // We use 0 indexing.
        while (true) {
            res = res + nums.get(k / fact);
            nums.remove(k / fact);
            if (nums.size() == 0) break;

            k = k % fact;
            fact = fact / nums.size();
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

By making this minimal change, we fix the off-by-one error and ensure that the last permutation number is included in the `nums` list.
