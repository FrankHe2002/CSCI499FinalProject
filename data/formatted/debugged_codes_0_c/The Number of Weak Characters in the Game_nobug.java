The bug in the provided code is in the logic for checking if a character is weak. 

In the last loop, the code checks if `point[1]` (which represents the character's attack) is less than `maxH[point[0] + 1]` (which represents the maximum attack of a character with the same defense as `point[0]`). If `point[1]` is less than `maxH[point[0] + 1]`, then the character is considered weak and `count` is incremented.

However, the bug is that the condition `point[1] < maxH[point[0] + 1]` is incorrect. It should be `point[1] < maxH[point[0]]`. This is because the maximum attack value of a character with the same defense as `point[0]` can be found at index `point[0]`, not `point[0] + 1`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition `point[1] < maxH[point[0] + 1]` to `point[1] < maxH[point[0]]`. 

Here is the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfWeakCharacters(int[][] properties) {
        int[] maxH = new int[100002];
        int count = 0;
        for (int[] point : properties) {
            maxH[point[0]] = Math.max(point[1], maxH[point[0]]);
        }
        for (int i = 100000; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxH[i] = Math.max(maxH[i + 1], maxH[i]);
        }

        for (int[] point : properties) {
            if (point[1] < maxH[point[0]])
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
