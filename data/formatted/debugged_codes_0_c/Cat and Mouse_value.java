The bug in the provided code is in the condition for checking if the mouse wins or cat wins in the last two if-else statements in the dfs method.

In this line:
```java
} else if (((time & 1) == 0 && (state & 2) > 0) || (time & 0) == 1 && state == 2) {
```

There is a mistake in the second part of the condition:
```java
(time & 0) == 1
```
The bitwise AND operator with 0 will always result in 0, so this condition will never be true.

To fix this bug, we need to change the second condition to:
```java
(time & 1) == 1
```

Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 911 ms (Top 7.06%) | Memory: 70.7 MB (Top 63.53%)
class Solution {
    int TIME_MAX = 200;
    int DRAW = 0;
    int MOUSE_WIN = 1;
    int CAT_WIN = 2;

    public int catMouseGame(int[][] graph) {
        return dfs(0, new int[] {1, 2}, graph, new Integer[TIME_MAX + 1][graph.length][graph.length]);
    }

    private int dfs(int time, int[] p, int[][] graph, Integer[][][] memo) { // p[0] -> mouse position, p[1] -> cat position
        Integer old = memo[time][p[0]][p[1]];
        if (old != null) return old; // all the base cases here
        if (time >= TIME_MAX) return DRAW;
        if (p[0] == 0) return MOUSE_WIN;
        if (p[0] == p[1]) return CAT_WIN;
        int state = 0;
        int where = p[time & 1];
        int res = DRAW;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph[where].length; i++) {
            if ((time & 1) == 0 || graph[where][i] > 0) { // if mouse turn or cat turn and the dest is not 0, do ...
                p[time & 1] = graph[where][i];
                state |= 1 << dfs(time + 1, p, graph, memo);
                if ((time & 1)
