Upon reviewing the Java code, it appears that the "haylength" and "needlelength" variables are being compared incorrectly in the if statement. The if statement checks whether "haylength" is greater than "needlelength" and returns -1 if true. However, the intent seems to be to check if "haylength" is less than "needlelength". 

To fix this bug, the if statement should be modified to check if "haylength" is less than "needlelength", and if so, return -1. 

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        int haylength = haystack.length();
        int needlelength = needle.length();
        if (haylength < needlelength)
            return - 1;
        for (int i = 0; i <= haylength - needlelength; i++) {
            int j = 0;
            while (j < needlelength && haystack.charAt(i + j) == needle.charAt(j))
                j++;
            if (j == needlelength) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return - 1;
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that the program returns -1 when the length of the haystack is less than the length of the needle, as intended.
