Bug Type: Infinite Loop

Reasoning Process:
1. The code uses a nested loop to iterate through the array and calculate the count of pairs.
2. The outer loop iterates through each element in the array.
3. The inner loop calculates powers of 2, starting from 1 and increasing it by multiplying by 2 on each iteration.
4. The inner loop condition is `i >= 22`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 22.
5. However, the initial value of `i` is 0, so the condition `i >= 22` is always false, resulting in an infinite loop.
6. As a result, the code gets stuck in the infinite loop and never progresses further, causing it to not produce the correct result.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the inner loop condition should be changed from `i >= 22` to `i <= 22`, so that the loop iterates 22 times, which is the intended number of iterations.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    int mod = 1000000007;

    public int countPairs(int[] arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int n = arr.length;
        long res = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            int power = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i <= 22; i++) {
                if (map.containsKey(power - num)) {
                    res += map.get(power - num);
                    res %= mod;
                }
                power *= 2;
            }
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```
