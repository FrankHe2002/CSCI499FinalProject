There doesn't appear to be any syntax errors or logical errors in the given code. However, there is a potential bug related to the condition in the while loop.

In the while loop, the condition `temp.last() % 2 == 0` checks if the last element in the TreeSet `temp` is even. If it is, the loop continues to execute. However, this condition does not guarantee that the minimum deviation is being calculated correctly.

To fix this bug and ensure that the minimum deviation is calculated accurately, we need to change the condition in the while loop to consider the minimum element in `temp` as well. We should check if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in `temp` is odd, not just if the last element is even. This ensures that the deviation is minimized correctly.

Additionally, we can optimize the code by using a PriorityQueue instead of a TreeSet because we only need the maximum and minimum elements, and the PriorityQueue has a better time complexity for removing and adding elements compared to the TreeSet.

Here's the corrected and optimized code:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int minimumDeviation(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> temp = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int max = 0;

        // Add all elements to the PriorityQueue after making them even
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                temp.add(i);
                max = Math.max(max, i);
            } else {
                temp.add(i * 2);
                max = Math.max(max, i * 2);
            }
        }

        int md = max - temp.peek();

        // Continue until the maximum or minimum element is odd
        while (temp.peek() % 2 == 0 || max % 2 == 0) {
            max = temp.poll();
            md = Math.min(md, max - temp.peek());
            temp.add(max / 2);
            max = Math.max(max / 2, temp.peek());
        }

        return md;
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the `nums` array and add the elements to a PriorityQueue. We keep track of the maximum value encountered so far. While the maximum or minimum element in the PriorityQueue is even, we remove the maximum, calculate the new minimum deviation, add the maximum divided by 2 back to the PriorityQueue, and update the maximum value. Finally, we return the minimum deviation.
