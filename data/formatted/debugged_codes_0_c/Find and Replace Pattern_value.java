Bug type: IndexOutOfBoundsException

Explanation:
1. The code iterates over each word in the "words" array.
2. For each word, it creates a map to store the mapping between characters of the pattern and characters of the word.
3. It also creates a set to keep track of characters already mapped to avoid duplicate mappings.
4. It initializes the variable 'i' to -1, intending to use it as the index for iterating over the characters of the word.
5. The loop condition is "i < word.length()", which would normally terminate the loop when 'i' becomes equal to or larger than word.length(). However, since 'i' is initialized to -1, the condition is never met, and the loop runs forever.
6. Inside the loop, it attempts to access the 'i' position of the pattern (pattern.charAt(i)). Since 'i' is -1, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.

To fix this bug, we need to update the initialization of 'i' to 0 instead of -1. This will ensure that the loop condition is met and the loop terminates correctly.

Fixed code: 
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findAndReplacePattern(String[] words, String pattern) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            Map<Character, Character> map = new HashMap<>();
            Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
            int i = 0;
            for (; i < word.length(); i++) {
                char ch = pattern.charAt(i);
                if (map.get(ch) == null) {
                    if (set.contains(word.charAt(i))) break;
                    map.put(ch, word.charAt(i));
                    set.add(word.charAt(i));
                } else {
                    char mc = map.get(ch);
                    if (mc != word.charAt(i)) break;
                }
            }
            if (i == pattern.length()) result.add(word);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
