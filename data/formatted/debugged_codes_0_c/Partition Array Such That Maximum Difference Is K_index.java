Potential bug:
The code may throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing nums[i + 1] in the for loop.

Explanation:
1. The code is trying to partition the given array nums into multiple subarrays such that the difference between the maximum and minimum element in each subarray is less than or equal to k.
2. The code first sorts the array nums in ascending order.
3. It then iterates through the array and checks the difference between the current element nums[i + 1] and the previous element nums[prev]. If this difference is greater than k, it increments the counter c and updates the previous index prev to the current index.
4. However, the for loop starts from i = 0 and goes up to the length of the array nums. When i reaches the last index (nums.length - 1), the condition (nums[i + 1] - nums[prev] <= k) will access nums[nums.length], which is out of bounds resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the condition in the for loop to iterate until the second last index (i < nums.length - 1) to avoid the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
2. We also need to initialize the counter c to 0 instead of 1, as it needs to count the number of partitions and not assume that there is already one partition.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {

    public int partitionArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int c = 0, prev = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i + 1] - nums[prev] <= k) continue;
            c++;
            prev = i;
        }
        return c + 1;
    }
}
```
