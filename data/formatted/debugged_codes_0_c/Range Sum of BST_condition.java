The bug in the provided code is in the condition `if (root.val < low && root.val <= high)` inside the `dfs` method.

Explanation:
1. The code checks if the value of `root` is less than `low` and less than or equal to `high`.
2. This condition will never be true because if `root.val < low`, the code will go to the `if (root.val < low)` condition and the subsequent recursive calls will be made to either `root.left` or `root.right`, skipping the code inside the `if (root.val < low && root.val <= high)` condition.
3. Therefore, the sum will never be incremented if `root` has such a value.

To fix the bug, we should change the condition `if (root.val < low && root.val <= high)` to just `if (root.val >= low && root.val <= high)`. This will include the nodes with values within the range.

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    private int sum = 0;
    
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        dfs(root, low, high);
        return sum;
    }
    
    public void dfs(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) return;
        
        if (root.val < low) dfs(root.right, low, high);
        else if (root.val > high) dfs(root.left, low, high);
        
        if (root.val >= low && root.val <= high) {
            sum += root.val;
            dfs(root.left, low, high);
            dfs(root.right, low, high);
        }
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code will correctly compute the sum of values in the given range.
