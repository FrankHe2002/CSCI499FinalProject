There doesn't appear to be any syntax errors or logical flaws in the code. However, there is a bug in the code related to the calculation of indices for values equal to the target.

In the second for loop where the indices are calculated, the loop variable `i` mistakenly starts from `smaller` and ends at `smaller + equal - 1`. This means that the indices are incorrect because they are not accounting for the values that are smaller than the target.

To fix this bug, we need to start the loop variable `i` from `0` and calculate the indices by adding `smaller + i` to the list instead of just `i`.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    /**
     * Algorithm:
     * - Parse the array once and count how many are lesser than target and how many are equal
     * - DO NOT sort the array as we don't need it sorted.
     * Just to know how many are lesser and how many are equal. O(N) better than O(NlogN - sorting)
     * - The response list will have a size = with the number of equal elements (as their positions)
     * - Loop from 0 to equal and add the values into the list by adding smaller + i. Return the list
     */
    public List<Integer> targetIndices(int[] nums, int target) {
        int smaller = 0;
        int equal = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < target) {
                smaller++;
            } else if (num == target) {
                equal++;
            }
        }
        List<Integer> indices = new ArrayList<>(equal);
        for (int i = 0; i < equal; i++) {
            indices.add(smaller + i);
        }
        return indices;
    }
}
```
