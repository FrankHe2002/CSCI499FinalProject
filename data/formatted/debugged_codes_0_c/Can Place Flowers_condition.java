The code is supposed to determine if it is possible to plant n flowers in a flowerbed represented by an array. However, there is a bug in the code.

The bug is in the second if statement inside the for loop. Currently, it checks if the previous flowerbed cell is not 1 and the current cell is 1, and if so, it sets the current cell to 1 and decrements n. This logic is incorrect because it means that we are planting a flower in the current cell without checking if the next cell is available. 

To fix this bug, we can update the logic to check if the previous and next flowerbed cells are not 1 before planting a flower in the current cell.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        if (flowerbed[0] != 1) {
            n--;
            flowerbed[0] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i - 1] != 1 && flowerbed[i + 1] != 1 && flowerbed[i] != 1) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                n--;
            }
        }
        return (n <= 0) ? true : false;
    }
}
```
