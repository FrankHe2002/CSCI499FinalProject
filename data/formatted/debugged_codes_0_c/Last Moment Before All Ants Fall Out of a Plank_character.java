Bug Type: Syntax Error

Bug: There is a syntax error in line 6 and line 10 of the code.

Line 6: `if (lefti] > max)` should be `if (left[i] > max)`
The index `i` is missing the square brackets, which is causing a syntax error.

Line 10: `if (n - right[i] > max)` should be `if (n - right[i] > max)`
The index `i` is missing the square brackets, which is causing a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we need to add the missing square brackets in both the if conditions.

```java
class Solution {
    public int getLastMoment(int n, int[] left, int[] right) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < left.length; i++) {
            if (left[i] > max)
                max = left[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < right.length; i++) {
            if (n - right[i] > max)
                max = n - right[i];
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
