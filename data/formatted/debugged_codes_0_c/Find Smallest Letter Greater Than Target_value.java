The bug in the provided code is in the initialization of the `end` variable. 

The `end` variable is initialized with `letters.length - 2`, which is one less than the actual length of the `letters` array. This means that the last element of the array is not considered in the binary search. 

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `end` variable with `letters.length - 1`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int start = 0, end = letters.length - 1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] > target) {    //strictly greater is the solution we want
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return letters[start % letters.length];    // this is the wrap around condition , we use modulo %
    }
}
```
