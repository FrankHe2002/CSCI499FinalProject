The bug in the provided code lies in the `findGCD` method. 

In the for loop, the condition `i <= max` is incorrect. It should be `i <= max - num` because we are incrementing `i` by `num` at each iteration. Since the maximum number in the `exist` set is `max`, we should stop the loop when `i` reaches `max - num` to avoid going beyond the maximum number.

Additionally, the initial value of `val` variable should be `num` instead of `0`. This is because we are calculating the greatest common divisor between `num` and the numbers in the `exist` set, so the initial value should be `num`.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made to the code:

```java
public boolean findGCD(int num) {
    int val = num; // initialize val to num
    for (int i = num; i <= max - num; i += num) // update loop condition
        if (exist.contains(i)) val = gcd(i, val);
    return (val == num);
}
```

This fix ensures that the loop stops at `max - num` and initializes `val` to `num` for correct calculation of the greatest common divisor.
