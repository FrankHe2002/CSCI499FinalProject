The bug in the provided code is in the calculation of the mid index in the `createTree` method. 

Currently, the line `int mid = start + (end - start) - 2;` is incorrect. It should be `int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;`.

The reasoning process to identify the bug is as follows:

1. The code converts a sorted linked list into a binary search tree.
2. The `sortedListToBST` method first converts the linked list into an ArrayList, `treelist`, holding the values of the linked list in sorted order.
3. Then, it calls the `createTree` method to build the binary search tree from `treelist`.
4. The `createTree` method recursively constructs a node and assigns its left and right subtrees.
5. The bug is in the calculation of the mid index. Currently, it subtracts 2 instead of dividing by 2 to find the midpoint.

To fix the bug, we need to change the calculation of the mid index in the `createTree` method. It should be `int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {

    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {

        ListNode tmp = head;
        ArrayList<Integer> treelist = new ArrayList<>();

        while (tmp != null) {
            treelist.add(tmp.val);
            tmp = tmp.next;
        }

        return createTree(treelist, 0, treelist.size() - 1);
    }

    public TreeNode createTree(ArrayList<Integer> treelist, int start, int end) {

        if (start > end)
            return null;

        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(treelist.get(mid));

        node.left = createTree(treelist, start, mid - 1);
        node.right = createTree(treelist, mid + 1, end);
        return node;
    }
}
```
