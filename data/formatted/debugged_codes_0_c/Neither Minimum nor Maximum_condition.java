## Bug Type
The bug in the provided Java code is a logical error.

## Reasoning Process
1. The code is attempting to find the second smallest element in the given array `nums`.
2. The variable `n` is assigned the length of the array `nums`.
3. The condition `if (n >= 3)` is used to check if the array has at least 3 elements. If true, the code returns `-1`.
4. If the array has less than 3 elements, the code sorts the array in ascending order using `Arrays.sort(nums)`.
5. Finally, the code returns the second element of the sorted array `nums[1]`, which should be the second smallest element in the original array.

## Bug Identification
The bug in the code is in the logic of the condition `if (n >= 3)`. It should be `if (n < 3)` instead. This is because the code should return `-1` if the array has less than 3 elements, not if it has 3 or more elements.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition from `if (n >= 3)` to `if (n < 3)`.

class Solution {
    public int findNonMinOrMax(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < 3) return -1;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums[1];
    }
}
