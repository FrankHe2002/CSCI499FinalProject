The provided Java code appears to be correct and bug-free.

The code is implementing the `arrayPairSum` method, which takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of the minimum values of each pair. The code first sorts the input array in ascending order using `Arrays.sort(nums)`. Then, it iterates over the sorted array, starting from index 0 and incrementing by 2 in each iteration. In each iteration, it adds the value at the current index to the `sum` variable.

The code uses a straightforward and efficient approach to calculate the sum of minimum values in each pair, and the logic appears to be correct.

No bug has been identified in the provided code.
