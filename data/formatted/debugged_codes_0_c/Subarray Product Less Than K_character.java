There are a few bugs in the given Java code:

1. Syntax error: There is a missing closing parenthesis in the while loop condition on line 26. It should be `product >= k)` instead of `product >= k {`.

2. Incorrect calculation of subarray length: The calculation of the length of the current subarray is incorrect. It should be `j - i + 1` instead of `length = j - i + 1` in line 35.

To fix these bugs, the following changes can be made:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(int[] nums, int k) {
        //if k=0 then ans will always be zero as we have positive integers array only.
        if (k == 0)
            return 0;

        int length = 0;
        long product = 1;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        int ans = 0;

        while (j < n) {
            product *= nums[j];
            //Add the number to current window if the product is less than k and calculate no of subarrays using length only.
            if (product < k) {
                length += 1;
                ans += length;
            } else {
                //Remove element one by one till product becomes less than k.
                while (i <= j && product >= k) {
                    product /= nums[i];
                    i++;
                }
                //As we have added only 1 element to the window and this element can make subarray to j-i element along with itself.
                ans += (j - i) + 1;
            }
            j++;
            //Update the current subarray length.
            length = j - i;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

In this fix, I added the missing closing parenthesis in line 26 and also updated the calculation of the subarray length in line 40.
