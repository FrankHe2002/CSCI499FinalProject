Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:
1. The main loop in the `arriveOnTime` method iterates from 0 to `dist.length - 2`.
2. In each iteration, it accesses the element at index `i + 2` of the `dist` array.
3. However, the `dist.length - 1` element is accessed outside the loop, without considering the length of the array.
4. This means that when `dist.length == 2`, the code will try to access `dist[2]`, which is out of bounds and will result in an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix:
- Modify the `arriveOnTime` method to loop until `dist.length - 2` instead of `dist.length - 1` to ensure that the last element is not accessed outside the loop.
- Change `for (int i = 0; i < dist.length - 1; i++)` to `for (int i = 0; i < dist.length - 2; i++)` in the `arriveOnTime` method.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSpeedOnTime(int[] dist, double hour) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = (int) 1e8;

        while (left < right) {
            int middle = (left + right) / 2;
            if (arriveOnTime(dist, hour, middle))
                right = middle;
            else left = middle + 1;
        }

        return right == (int) 1e8 ? - 1 : right;
    }

    private boolean arriveOnTime(int[] dist, double hour, int speed) {
        int time = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < dist.length - 2; i++) {
            time += Math.ceil((double) dist[i + 2] / speed);
        }
        return time + (double) dist[dist.length - 1] / speed <= hour;
    }
}
