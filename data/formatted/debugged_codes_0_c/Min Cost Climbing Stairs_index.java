The bug in the provided code is in the line `a[-1] = Math.min(cost[i - 1] + a[i - 1], cost[i - 2] + a[i - 2]);`. 

The index `-1` is not a valid index in the array `a`. The intention of this line is to calculate and store the minimum cost at each index `i` in the `a` array. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the index `-1` to `i`.

Here is the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int a[] = new int[cost.length + 1];
        a[0] = 0;
        a[1] = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i <= cost.length; i++) {
            a[i] = Math.min(cost[i - 1] + a[i - 1], cost[i - 2] + a[i - 2]);
        }
        return a[cost.length];
    }
}
```

In this fix, we simply changed `a[-1]` to `a[i]` in the assignment statement. By doing so, we correctly store the minimum cost for each index `i`.
