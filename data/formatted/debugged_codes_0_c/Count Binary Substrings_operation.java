Bug type: Logical error

In the given code, the logic used to count the number of binary substrings is incorrect. The code is trying to count the number of substrings where the number of consecutive 0's is equal to the number of consecutive 1's. However, the logic used is flawed and doesn't yield the correct count.

To fix the bug and count the number of valid binary substrings correctly, the code needs to be modified as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBinarySubstrings(String s) {
        int prevRunLength = 0;
        int curRunLength = 1;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                curRunLength++;
            } else {
                prevRunLength = curRunLength;
                curRunLength = 1;
            }
            if (prevRunLength >= curRunLength) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

This fix involves making a small change in the code. The variable `i` is only used within the loop and can be declared within the loop itself.
