The code looks fine at a first glance. However, there might be a bug related to the comparison of `first` with `null` in the second if statement.

In this if statement: `if (first != null || num > first)`, the condition is using the logical OR operator (`||`). This means that if `first` is not null, the second part of the condition (`num > first`) would not be evaluated, and the loop would continue. This is not the desired behavior.

To fix this issue, we should change the logical OR operator (`||`) to the logical AND operator (`&&`). This ensures that the second part of the condition is evaluated only if `first` is not null.

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        Integer first = null, second = null, third = null;
        for (Integer num : nums) {
            if (num.equals(first) || num.equals(second) || num.equals(third)) continue;
            if (first != null && num > first) {
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = num;
                continue;
            }
            if (second == null || num > second) {
                third = second;
                second = num;
                continue;
            }
            if (third == null || num > third) {
                third = num;
            }
        }
        return (third != null) ? third : first;
    }
}
```

This bug fix ensures that the code behaves as intended, comparing `first` with `null` in the second if statement.
