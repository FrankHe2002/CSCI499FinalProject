Bug Type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning:

1. The code counts the index starting from 0 and compares it with the length of the string `n`.
2. The while loop condition checks if `idx < n`. If it is false, the loop exits.
3. However, the code also checks if `idx == n` inside the loop to perform one more calculation.
4. This condition is incorrect because when `idx` becomes equal to `n`, it means that we have reached the end of the string and there are no more characters to process.
5. So, the condition `idx == n` should be changed to `idx == n-1` to perform the extra calculation when `idx` is at the last character of the string.

Fix:

Change `if (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == ')' || idx == n)` to `if (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == ')' || idx == n-1)`.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    int idx; // this index traverse the string in one pass, between different level of recursion

    public int calculate(String s) {
        idx = 0; // Initialization should be here
        return helper(s);
    }

    private int helper(String s) {
        int res = 0, num = 0, preSign = 1, n = s.length();
        while (idx < n) {
            char c = s.charAt(idx++);
            if (c == '(') num = helper(s); // Let recursion solve the sub-problem
            else if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') num = num * 10 + c - '0';
            if (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == ')' || idx == n-1) { // fixed the off-by-one error
                res += preSign - num;
                if (c == ')') return res; // end of a sub-problem
                num = 0;
                preSign = c == '+' ? 1 : - 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
