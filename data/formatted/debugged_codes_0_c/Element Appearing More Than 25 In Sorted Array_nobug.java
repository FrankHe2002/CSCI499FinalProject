The bug in the provided Java code is that the condition `if (hm.get(i) > comp)` is checking if the frequency of the current element in the HashMap is greater than `comp`, but it should be checking if the frequency is greater than or equal to `comp`. This is because the frequency can be equal to `comp` and the current element can still be considered as a "special integer".

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition `if (hm.get(i) > comp)` to `if (hm.get(i) >= comp)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int findSpecialInteger(int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        int comp = arr.length / 4;
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (!hm.containsKey(i)) {
                hm.put(i, 1);
            } else {
                int val = hm.get(i);
                val++;
                hm.put(i, val);
            }
            if (hm.get(i) >= comp) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
