The code provided is an implementation of a simplified version of a HashMap data structure. It contains three methods: `put`, `get`, and `remove`, which are used to add, retrieve, and remove key-value pairs from the map.

To review the code and identify any potential bugs, we will go through each method step by step:

1. `put` method:
   - The method calculates the bucket for the given key using the modulo operator.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - If the bucket is empty, i.e., there are no entries for that key, it creates a new `LinkedList` entry and adds the new key-value pair to it.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - If the bucket is not empty, i.e., there are existing entries for that key, it checks each entry to see if the key already exists. If it does, it updates the value for that key.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - If the key doesn't already exist in the bucket, it creates a new entry and adds it to the linked list.
     - No bug identified.

   Overall, the `put` method looks correct without any bugs.

2. `get` method:
   - The method calculates the bucket for the given key using the modulo operator.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - It retrieves the linked list associated with the calculated bucket.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - If the linked list is empty, i.e., there are no entries for that key, it returns -1 to indicate no mapping exists for the key.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - If the linked list is not empty, it checks each entry to see if the key exists. If it does, it returns the corresponding value.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - If the key doesn't exist in the linked list, it returns -1 to indicate no mapping exists for the key.
     - No bug identified.

   Overall, the `get` method looks correct without any bugs.

3. `remove` method:
   - The method calculates the bucket for the given key using the modulo operator.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - It initializes a variable `toRemove` to null.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - If the linked list associated with the calculated bucket is empty, i.e., there are no entries for that key, it returns without performing any further operations.
     - No bug identified.
   
   - If the linked list is not empty
