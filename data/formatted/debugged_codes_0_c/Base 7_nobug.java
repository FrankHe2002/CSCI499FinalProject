Based on the code provided, there doesn't seem to be any obvious syntax errors or logical errors. However, there is one potential bug that could occur if the input number is Integer.MIN_VALUE. 

The bug is caused by taking the absolute value of the negative number, which results in a negative number. This is because the absolute value of Integer.MIN_VALUE exceeds the range of a positive integer. Therefore, the code should handle this special case by manually appending the "-" sign before converting the number to positive.

Here is the fixed version of the code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String convertToBase7(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            return "0";
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int temp = num;
        if (temp < 0) {
            sb.append("-");
            temp = -temp;
        }
        while (temp > 0) {
            int rem = temp % 7;
            sb.append(rem);
            temp = temp / 7;
        }
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
