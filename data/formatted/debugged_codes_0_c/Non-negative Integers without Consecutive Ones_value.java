The code appears to have a bug in the while loop condition. Currently, it is `while (digi-- >= 0)`, but it should be `while (digi > 0)`.

Here's the reasoning process and step-by-step explanation for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The code calculates the number of binary digits (`digi`) in the given integer `n`. It then initializes an array `dp` to store the number of valid integers (with no consecutive 1s) for each number of binary digits.
2. The code then goes through each binary digit of `n` starting from the most significant bit. If a digit is 1, it adds the count of valid integers for that digit (`dp[digi]`) to the result. If the previous digit was also 1, it returns the result.
3. There is an issue with the while loop condition `while (digi-- >= 0)`, which decrements `digi` and checks if it is greater than or equal to zero. However, `digi` is initialized as the number of binary digits in `n` and should start from one less than that. So the correct condition should be `while (digi > 0)`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 85.57%) | Memory: 41.4 MB (Top 46.39%)
class Solution {
    public int findIntegers(int n) {
        int val = 0, res = 0, cn = n, digi = 0, prevdig = 0, i;//digi means bin digi
        while (cn > 0) {
            cn = cn >> 1;
            digi++;
        }
        int dp[] = new int[digi + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 2;
        for (i = 2; i <= digi; i++)
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        digi--;
        while (digi > 0) {
            if ((n & (1 << digi)) > 0) {
                res += dp[digi];
                if (prevdig == 1) return res;
                prevdig = 1;
            } else prevdig = 0;
            digi--;
        }

        return res + 1;
    }
}
