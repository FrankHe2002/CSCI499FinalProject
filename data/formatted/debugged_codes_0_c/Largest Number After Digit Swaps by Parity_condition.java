Potential bug type: Infinite loop

Reasoning process:
1. The code uses a while loop to iterate over each digit of the input number.
2. The condition for the while loop is `num >= 0`, which means the loop will continue as long as `num` is greater than or equal to zero.
3. Inside the loop, `num` is divided by 10, reducing its value. Eventually, `num` will become negative.
4. Since the condition for the while loop is `num >= 0`, the loop will never end if `num` becomes negative.

Additionally, there are a couple of issues with the code:
1. The comment at the top of the code suggests that the runtime and memory usage have been measured and the values provided are the results. However, there is no code that measures the runtime and memory usage. Therefore, the comment is misleading and it should either be removed or the appropriate code should be added.
2. The method name "largestInteger" suggests that the method should return the largest integer possible, given a number. However, the implementation does not guarantee that the returned value will be the largest possible integer. This should be clarified in the code comments or the method name should be changed.

To fix the bug and address the other issues:
1. Change the condition for the while loop to `num > 0` to avoid an infinite loop.
2. Remove or update the misleading comment at the top of the code.
3. Clarify the purpose of the method or update the method name accordingly.

```java
// Bug type: Infinite loop

class Solution {
    public int getLargestOddInteger(int num) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> opq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> epq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int bnum = num;
        while (num > 0) {
            int cur = num % 10;
            if (cur % 2 == 1) {
                opq.add(cur);
            } else {
                epq.add(cur);
            }
            num /= 10;
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        num = bnum;
        while (num > 0) {
            int cur = num % 10;
            if (cur % 2 == 1)
                sb.insert(0, opq.poll());
            else
                sb.insert(0, epq.poll());
            num /= 10;
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(sb.toString());
    }
}
