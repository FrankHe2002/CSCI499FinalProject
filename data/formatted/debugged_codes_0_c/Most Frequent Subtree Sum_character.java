The code is a Java implementation of finding the most frequent subtree sum in a binary tree. 

To identify the bug types in the code, we need to analyze the code step by step:

1. The code initializes a HashMap called 'map' to store the sum of each subtree.
2. The 'sum' method is recursively called to calculate the sum of each subtree, and then stores the sum as a key in the 'map' with its corresponding frequency as the value.
3. The 'findFrequentTreeSum' method finds the maximum frequency of a sum in the 'map' by iterating over the keys and updating the 'max' variable.
4. The 'findFrequentTreeSum' method also counts the number of sums with the maximum frequency and stores it in the 'count' variable.
5. Finally, an array 'ans' is created with the size of 'count' and populated with the keys that have the maximum frequency of sums.

The bug in the code lies in the last for loop of the 'findFrequentTreeSum' method:

```java
for (Integer key : map.keySet()) {
    if (max == map.get(key)) {
        ans[counter++ = key;
    }
}
```

Here, there is a syntax error. The closing square bracket for the 'ans[counter++]' operation is missing, and there is also a typo in the '=' operator. It should be 'ans[counter++] = key;'. This code line should be fixed to:

```java
ans[counter++] = key;
```

By fixing this bug, the code should work correctly now.
