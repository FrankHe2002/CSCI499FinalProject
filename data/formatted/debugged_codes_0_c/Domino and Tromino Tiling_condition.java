After reviewing the code, I identified two bugs:

1. The `for` loop condition is incorrect. It should be `i <= n` instead of `i >= n`. The loop is intended to iterate from `3` to `n`, inclusive.
2. The return statement is incorrect. It should be `return (int) dp[n]` instead of `return (int) dp[n - 1]`. The last element in the `dp` array represents the number of tilings for `n` tiles.

I will now fix these bugs and provide the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTilings(int n) {
        long[] dp = new long[n + 3];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 2;
        dp[2] = 5;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * 2 + dp[i - 3]) % 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) dp[n];
    }
}
```

With these fixes, the code should now correctly calculate the number of tilings for `n` tiles.
