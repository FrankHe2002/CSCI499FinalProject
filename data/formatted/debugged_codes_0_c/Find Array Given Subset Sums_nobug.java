The bug in the provided Java code is in the line:

```java
int diff = sums[1] - sums[0]
```

The code assumes that the first two elements of the `sums` array will always be the two smallest elements. However, this may not be the case. If the `sums` array is not sorted in ascending order, then taking the difference between the first two elements may result in the wrong value for `diff`.

To fix this bug, we need to determine the correct pair of smallest elements in the `sums` array. One way to do this is to sort the `sums` array and then take the difference between the first two elements.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 73 ms (Top 62.96%) | Memory: 85.2 MB (Top 70.37%)
class Solution {
    public int[] recoverArray(int n, int[] sums) {
        Arrays.sort(sums);
        int m = sums.length;
        int[] res = new int[n], left = new int[m / 2], right = new int[m / 2];

        int diff = sums[1] - sums[0];
        int hasZero = 0, p = -1, q = -1, k = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++ j) {
            if (k <= q && right[k] == sums[j]) k++;
            else {
                if (0 == sums[j]) hasZero = 1;
                left[++ p] = sums[j];
                right[++ q] = sums[j] + diff;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++ i) {
            if (1 == hasZero) {
                res[i] = diff;
                sums = left;
            } else {
                res[i] = - diff;
                sums = right;
            }
            m /= 2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, I have moved the calculation of `diff` before the loop to ensure that the first two elements used for calculating `diff` are indeed the smallest elements in the `sums` array.
