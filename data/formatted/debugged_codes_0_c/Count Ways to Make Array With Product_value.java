The code appears to be correct and does not contain any syntax errors or logical issues. However, there is a bug related to the `PRIMES` array.

1. The bug is identified by observing the `PRIMES` array. It contains the number 2 twice.
2. The bug is that the number 83 is missing in the `PRIMES` array.

To fix the bug and include the missing number, the `PRIMES` array should be modified as follows:

```java
int[] PRIMES = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97};
```

This fix adds the number 83 back to the array.

Here is the updated code:

```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 72.7%) | Memory: 45.86 MB (Top 86.3%)

class Solution {
    // List of primes upto sqrt(10e4)
    int[] PRIMES = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97};
    // Factors of integers upto 13
    int[][] SMALL_INT_FACTORS = {null, {1}, {2}, {3}, {2, 2}, {5}, {2, 3}, {7}, {2, 2, 2}, {3, 3}, {2, 5}, {11}, {2, 2, 3}, {13}};

    public int[] waysToFillArray(int[][] queries) {
        int n = queries.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ans[i] = dewIt(queries[i]);
        return ans;
    }

    private int dewIt(int[] q) {
        long ans = 1;
        int k = q[0], num = q[1];
        for
