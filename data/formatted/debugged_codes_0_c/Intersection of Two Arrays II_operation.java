The bug in the provided Java code is in the line `int ans[] = new int[1000 / 1];`. The size of the array `ans` is set incorrectly, resulting in an array that is smaller than needed.

To identify the bug, let's understand the purpose of the code. The `intersect` method is trying to find the intersection of two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where intersection means the common elements between the two arrays.

The given code initializes an array `dp` of size 1000+1 and it is used to count the occurrences of elements in `nums1`. Then, it initializes an array `ans` of size 1000/1 to store the result of the intersection. 

The bug occurs in the line where the `ans` array is created. The division operation `/` is used instead of the multiplication operation `*`, resulting in an incorrect size of `ans`. Since the size is smaller than needed, there is a risk of array index out of bounds error when trying to store elements in `ans`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `int ans[] = new int[1000 / 1];` to `int ans[] = new int[1000 + 1];`, ensuring that the size of `ans` matches the maximum possible size.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int[] dp = new int[1000 + 1];
        for (int i : nums1) {
            dp[i]++;
        }
        int ptr = 0;
        int ans[] = new int[1000 + 1];
        for (int i : nums2) {
            if (dp[i] != 0) {
                ans[ptr] = i;
                ptr++;
                dp[i]--;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(ans, 0, ptr);
    }
}
```
