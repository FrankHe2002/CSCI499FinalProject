Upon reviewing the provided Java code, I identified the following bug:

1. The bug is in the inner `for` loop where the variable `Runtime` is used as an index to access the `words` array. However, `Runtime` is not declared or initialized anywhere in the code, which results in a compilation error.

To fix this bug, I will replace `Runtime` with `i` as the index variable to access the `words` array.
