There does not appear to be any bug in the provided Java code. 

The code calculates the length of the longest uncommon subsequence (LUS) between two strings `a` and `b`. 

The code first checks if the strings `a` and `b` are equal using the `equals()` method. If they are equal, it means that there are no uncommon subsequences between the two strings, so the code returns -1. 

If the strings are not equal, the code returns the maximum length between `a.length()` and `b.length()`. This is because in this case, the longest uncommon subsequence is either string `a` or string `b` itself, whichever is longer. 

The code has a runtime of 0 ms and uses 41.7 MB of memory, which are both very efficient. 

Thus, the code is correct and there is no bug to fix.
