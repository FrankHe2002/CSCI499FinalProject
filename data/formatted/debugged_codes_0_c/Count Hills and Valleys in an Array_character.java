The bug in the provided Java code is a missing closing brace `}` at the end of the `for` loop block.

To fix this bug, we need to add the closing brace `}` after the last line of code inside the `for` loop block.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countHillValley(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;

        // Get head start. Find first index for which nums[index] != nums[index-1]
        int start = 1;
        while (start < nums.length && nums[start] == nums[start - 1])
            start++;

        int prev = start - 1; //index of prev different value num
        for (int i = start; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) //If numbers are same, simply ignore them
                continue;
            else {
                if (nums[i] > nums[prev] && nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) //compare current num with prev number and next number
                    result++;
                if (nums[i] < nums[prev] && nums[i] < nums[i + 1])
                    result++;
                prev = i;   // Now your current number will become prev number.
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
By analyzing the code, we can see that the closing brace `}` is missing after the `for` loop block. This is identified by noticing that the code indentation is incorrect, and the closing brace is not properly aligned with the opening brace of the `for` loop.

To fix this bug, we simply add the missing closing brace `}` after the last line of code inside the `for` loop block. The rest of the code remains the same.
