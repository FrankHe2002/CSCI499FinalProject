The bug in the provided code lies in the logic for mapping the board cells to corresponding numbers in the map. 

In the `snakesAndLadders` method, the inner loop that iterates over the columns doesn't properly handle the board indices. Instead of starting from `n-1`, it starts from `-1`, which results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the starting index of the inner loop from `-1` to `0` for the first loop iteration.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
public int snakesAndLadders(int[][] board) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    int count = 1;
    int n = board.length;
    boolean flag = true;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (flag) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] != -1) {
                    map.put(count, board[i][j]);
                }
                count++;
                flag = false;
            }
        } else {
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (board[i][j] != -1) {
                    map.put(count, board[i][j]);
                }
                flag = true;
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (board[0][0] != -1) return -1;
    int[] ans = getans(6, map, 1, n * n);
    return ans[0];
}
```

The fix involves changing the starting index of the inner loop in the first loop iteration from `-1` to `0`. This ensures that the column indices are within the valid range and avoids the exception.
