Bug Type: Loop Condition Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code is designed to calculate the maximum wealth in a 2D array of accounts. 
2. The outer loop iterates over the rows of the 2D array, while the inner loop iterates over the columns.
3. The bug can be identified by carefully examining the loop conditions.
4. In the outer loop, the condition `i > accounts.length` should be `i < accounts.length`. The loop should iterate as long as `i` is less than the length of the 2D array.
5. The current condition causes the outer loop to never execute, resulting in an incorrect output.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int temp = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                temp += accounts[i][j];
            }
            res = Math.max(res, temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
The bug has been fixed by changing the condition in line 4 from `i > accounts.length` to `i < accounts.length`.
