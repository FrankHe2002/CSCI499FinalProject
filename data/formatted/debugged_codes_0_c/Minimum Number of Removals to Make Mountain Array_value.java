The Java code is implementing a solution to find the minimum number of elements to remove from the given array `nums` in order to form a mountain. A mountain is defined as a sequence of numbers that first increases and then decreases.

Upon reviewing the code, the bug is in the calculation of the variable `max`. The current logic is incorrect because it only checks if `LIS[i] > 1` and `LDS[i] > 1` to update `max`. However, it should check if `LIS[i] > 1` and `LDS[i] > 1` and also if the sum of `LIS[i]` and `LDS[i] - 1` is greater than `max`.

The fix for the bug is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 103 ms (Top 13.28%) | Memory: 45.9 MB (Top 81.01%)
class Solution {
    public int minimumMountainRemovals(int[] nums) {

        int n = nums.length;
        int[] LIS = new int[n];
        int[] LDS = new int[n];

        Arrays.fill(LIS, 1);
        Arrays.fill(LDS, 1);
        // calculate the longest increase subsequence (LIS) for every index i
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j] && LIS[j] + 1 > LIS[i])
                    LIS[i] = LIS[j] + 1;
            }
        }

        // calculate the longest decreasing subsequence(LDS) for every index i and keep track of the maximum of LIS+LDS
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = n - 1; j > i; j--) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j] && LDS[j] + 1 > LDS[i])
                    LDS[i] = LDS[j] + 1;
            }

            if (LIS[i] > 1 && LDS[i] > 1)
                max = Math.max(LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1, max);
        }
        return n - max;
    }
}
```

The bug in the code has been successfully fixed.
