Bug type: Index out of bounds

Reasoning process:
1. The code calculates the average of an array of integers, `salary`.
2. The code initializes the variable `n` as the length of the array `salary` minus 2. This means that the calculation of the average will exclude the two smallest and two largest values in the array.
3. The code then initializes the variables `max` and `min` as the minimum and maximum values of the `Integer` class, respectively.
4. The code also initializes the variable `sum` as 0 to store the sum of the array elements.
5. The code then iterates over the array from index 0 to `n + 2`, which means it includes all elements in the array including the extra 2 elements beyond the length of the array (which should not be included in the sum or calculations).
6. Within each iteration, the code adds the element at the current index to the `sum`, updates the `max` value if necessary, and updates the `min` value if necessary.
7. Finally, the code calculates the average by subtracting the `max` and `min` values from the `sum` and dividing by `n`.
8. The result is cast to a `double` to ensure precision.

The bug in this code is that the iteration in the for loop goes beyond the length of the `salary` array. The loop should iterate from index 0 to `n`, excluding the extra 2 elements beyond the length of the array.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the condition in the for loop should be changed from `i < n + 2` to `i < n` to correctly iterate over the `salary` array.

```java
class Solution {
    public double average(int[] salary) {
        int n = salary.length - 2;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += salary[i];
            max = Math.max(max, salary[i]);
            min = Math.min(min, salary[i]);
        }
        return (double) (sum - max - min) / n;
    }
}
```
