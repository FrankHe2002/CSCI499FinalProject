The code appears to have a bug in the `helper()` method.

The bug:
1. The bug exists in the return statement: `return (left + right + root.val - 1)`. 
2. This line of code is adding the values from the left and right subtrees (which represent the number of coins that need to be distributed) and also subtracting 1 from the root value, without any apparent reason.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to change the return statement to simply return the total number of coins (left + right + root.val).
2. We also need to update the count variable by adding the absolute values of left and right.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 58.67+) | Memory: 43.1 MB (Top 15.04%)
class Solution {
    int count = 0;

    public int helper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        count += Math.abs(left) + Math.abs(right);
        return (left + right + root.val);
    }

    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return count;
    }
}
```

Now, the code should correctly count the number of coins required to be distributed, and the count variable should store the correct result.
