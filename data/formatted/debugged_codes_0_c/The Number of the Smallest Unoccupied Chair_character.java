Bug type: Syntax error 

Reasoning process:
1. Review the code and identify any compilation or runtime errors.
2. Locate any syntax errors, such as missing or extra brackets, parenthesis, or operators.
3. Determine if these syntax errors are causing the bug.

In this case, there is a syntax error in the following statement:
if (times[i][0 == targetStart) {
    break;
}

The bracket after "targetStart" is missing a closing parenthesis. This causes a syntax error.


Fix:
To fix the syntax error, add a closing parenthesis after "targetStart" in the if statement.

Updated code:
```java
    if (times[i][0] == targetStart) {
        break;
    }
```

The closing parenthesis is added after "targetStart" in the if statement to fix the syntax error.
