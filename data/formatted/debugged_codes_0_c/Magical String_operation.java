After reviewing the Java code, I have identified two potential bugs:

1. In the `next()` method of the `Magical` class, there is a division by zero error on line `int curr = 3 / nums.peekLast();`. This can cause an ArithmeticException to be thrown.
2. In the `next()` method of the `Magical` class, the condition `if (n-- < 0)` is incorrect. It should be `if (n <= 0)` since we want to check if `n` is less than or equal to zero, not less than zero.

To fix these issues, I will make the following changes:

1. Replace `int curr = 3 / nums.peekLast();` with `int curr = 3 / (nums.peekLast() == 1 ? 2 : 1);`. This will ensure there is no division by zero, and instead of using the value from `nums.peekLast()` directly, it will be used to determine if the division should be by 1 or 2.
2. Replace `if (n-- < 0)` with `if (n <= 0)`. This will correctly check if `n` is less than or equal to zero.

Here is the updated code with the bug fixes applied:

```java
// Runtime: 21 ms (Top 32.48%) | Memory: 43.8 MB (Top 21.66%)
class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n <= 3)
            return 1;
        Magical m = new Magical();
        int ans = 1;
        for (int i = 3; i < n; ++ i)
            if (m.next() == 1)
                ++ ans;
        return ans;
    }
}

class Magical {

    private Deque<Integer> nums;
    private int n;

    public Magical() {
        nums = new ArrayDeque<>();
        nums.offerLast(1);
        nums.offerLast(1);
        n = 1;
    }

    public int next() {
        if (n <= 0) {
            int c = nums.pollFirst();
            n = c - 2;
            int curr = 3 / (nums.peekLast() == 1 ? 2 : 1);
            for (; c > 0; -- c)
                nums.offerLast(curr);
            return curr;
        }
        return nums.peekLast();
    }
}
```
