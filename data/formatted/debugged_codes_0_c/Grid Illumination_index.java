Bug Type: Typo

Reasoning Process:
1. Read through the code to understand its purpose and logic.
2. Identify any potential syntax errors or logical mistakes.
3. Analyze the code to find any discrepancies or inconsistencies.

Bug Explanation:
In the nested for loop:
```java
for (int j = 0; j < dir.length; j++) {
    int rowdash = row1 + dir[d2val][0];
    int coldash = col1 + dir[j][1];
    int cellno1 = rowdash * n + coldash;
    ...
}
```
There is an incorrect variable usage. Instead of using `dir[d2val][0]` as the index to access the diagonal direction, it should be `dir[j][0]`.

Fix:
Replace `row1 + dir[d2val][0]` with `row1 + dir[j][0]` in line 8 of the nested for loop.

Revised Code:
```java
for (int j = 0; j < dir.length; j++) {
    int rowdash = row1 + dir[j][0];
    int coldash = col1 + dir[j][1];
    int cellno1 = rowdash * n + coldash;
    ...
}
```
