The bug in the provided Java code is in the first step, where it tries to find the index of the smallest element in the array through binary search.

Here is the fixed Java code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return false;

        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        int start = 0;

        // 1. Find index of the smallest element
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        start = left;

        // 2. Figure out in which side our target lies
        left = 0;
        right = nums.length - 1;
        if (target >= nums[start] && target <= nums[right]) {
            left = start;
        } else {
            right = start;
        }

        // 3. Run normal binary search in the sorted half
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return true;

            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

Reasoning process and thinking step-by-step for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The initial code looks for the index of the smallest element in the array, which is done through a binary search. However, there are unnecessary while loops that try to skip duplicate elements. These loops are not required for finding the index of the smallest element.
2. Another issue is that the `start` variable, which should store the index of the smallest element, is set to `left` at the wrong place. It should be set after finding the index of the smallest element.
3. Additionally, the if-else statements for checking if the target lies in the left or right side of the array are incorrect. The conditions should use `&&` instead of `||` to properly check if the target is within the range.
4. Finally, the while loop for the second step should still run when `left` is less than or equal to `right`, so the condition
