The bug in the provided code is in the for loop condition. The condition `i > repeat + 2` should be `i < repeat + 2`. The correct code should be:

```java
// Runtime: 305 ms (Top 62.11%) | Memory: 113.5 MB (Top 30.98%)
class Solution {
    public int repeatedStringMatch(String a, String b) {
        String copyA = a;
        int count = 1;
        int repeat = b.length() / a.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < repeat + 2; i++) {
            if (a.contains(b)) {
                return count;
            } else {
                a += copyA;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows:

1. We start by analyzing the for loop condition. The condition is `i > repeat + 2`.
2. We notice that in order for the loop to execute, `i` should be greater than `repeat + 2`.
3. However, if `repeat` is a positive number, which is likely the case, then `repeat + 2` will always be greater than `i`.
4. Therefore, the loop will never execute and the program will always return -1, which is incorrect.
5. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `i < repeat + 2` so that the loop executes the correct number of times.
6. We make this change in the provided code and the bug is fixed.
