The bug in the provided Java code is in the double nested loop that updates the shortest path distances between vertices (the Floyd-Warshall algorithm). 

In the outer loop, the value of `i` is incorrectly initialized as -1. It should start from 0 to `n-1` to represent the indices of the vertices correctly. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the initialization of the `i` loop from `-1` to `0`.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        // rest of the code
    }
}
```

This change will ensure that all vertices are considered correctly when updating the shortest path distances.
