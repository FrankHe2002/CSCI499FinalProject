The provided code calculates the sum of all left leaves in a binary tree. 

To identify the bug, we need to examine the logic of the code and understand the expected behavior.

1. The code first checks if the root node is null. If so, it returns 0.
2. Then, it checks if the left child of the root exists and if it is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right child).
3. If the above condition is true, it returns the value of the left child plus the sum of left leaves in its left and right subtrees.
4. If the above condition is false, it calculates the sum of left leaves in the left and right subtrees separately and returns their sum.

Based on this logic, the bug in the code is that it is not correctly counting all the left leaves. The condition `(root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null)` only checks if the left child is a leaf without considering if it is actually a left leaf. This means that it may count nodes in the left subtree that are not left leaves.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the left child is a leaf and if it is a left child as well. We can introduce an additional condition `root.left != null && root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null` to ensure that the left child is not null and it has no left or right child.

Also, since the condition is used in multiple places, we can assign it to a variable `isLeftLeaf` to improve code readability.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode root) {

        if (root == null)
            return 0;

        boolean isLeftLeaf = root.left != null && root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null;
        if (isLeftLeaf) {
            return root.left.val + sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left) + sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right);
        } else {
            return sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left) + sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right);
        }

    }
}
```
