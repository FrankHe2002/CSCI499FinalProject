Bug type:
The bug in the given code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
1. The code first splits the input paragraph into an array of words by removing punctuation and converting them to lowercase.
2. Then, it creates a HashMap to store the frequency of each word.
3. It iterates over each word in the array and checks if it already exists in the HashMap.
4. If it does, the code increments the count of that word by 1 using the `replace()` method.
5. If it doesn't, the code adds the word to the HashMap with a count of 1 using the `put()` method.
6. After counting the frequencies, the code iterates over the banned words array and removes them from the HashMap if they exist.
7. Finally, it returns the most common word by finding the entry with the maximum value in the HashMap using `Collections.max()`.

Bug Fix:
The bug in the code is in the counting part, specifically in how the `replace()` method is used. The `replace()` method in the HashMap does not need to take the current value of the key as the second argument, as it automatically replaces the value for the given key.

To fix this issue, we need to change the line `hm.replace(words[i], hm.get(words[i]), hm.get(words[i]) + 1);` to `hm.replace(words[i], hm.get(words[i]) + 1);`.

Here's the revised code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {

        HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        String[] words = paragraph.replaceAll("[!?',;.]", " ").toLowerCase().split("\\s+");
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (hm.containsKey(words[i]))
                hm.replace(words[i], hm.get(words[i]) + 1);
            else
                hm.put(words[i], 1);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < banned.length; i++)
            if (hm.containsKey(banned[i]))
                hm.remove(banned[i]);

        return Collections.max(hm.entrySet(), Map.Entry.comparingByValue()).getKey();
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that the frequency of words is correctly counted in the HashMap.
