The bug in the provided code is a missing closing parenthesis in the max() method.

To identify the bug:
1. I would start by reviewing the code and looking for any syntax errors or logical issues.
2. In the max() method, I notice that there is a missing closing parenthesis after the condition "if (a > b)".
3. This missing parenthesis causes a compilation error and prevents the code from compiling successfully.

To fix the bug, I would add the missing closing parenthesis in the max() method.

```java
class Solution {
    int max(int a, int b) {
        if (a > b)
            return a;
        else
            return b;
    }

    int min(int a, int b) {
        if (a > b)
            return b;
        else
            return a;
    }

    public int countDigitOne(int n) {
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i *= 10) {
            int divider = i * 10;
            c += (n / divider) * i + min(max((n % divider - i + 1), 0), i);
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```
