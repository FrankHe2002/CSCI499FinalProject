Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a `PriorityQueue` to store the elements of the `nums` array in descending order.
2. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
3. It then iterates over the elements of `nums`, dividing `sum` by the current element and adding it to the `PriorityQueue`.
4. It also calculates the variable `req` as the sum from step 3.
5. It enters a while loop as long as `sum` is greater than `req` divided by 2.
6. In each iteration of the while loop, it retrieves the largest element from the `PriorityQueue`, divides it by 2, adds it back to the `PriorityQueue`, increments `res`, and subtracts the divided value from `sum`.
7. The while loop continues until `sum` is no longer greater than `req` divided by 2.
8. The value of `res` is then returned.

Bug explanation:
1. The bug can be found in the line `sum /= (double) i;`.
2. The intention of this line seems to be to divide the current value of `sum` by the current element `i`, but it is wrongly placed inside the loop that iterates over the elements of `nums`.
3. As a result, `sum` is divided by `i` in every iteration, which is incorrect and leads to incorrect results.

Fix:
Move the line `sum /= (double) i;` outside the loop that iterates over the elements of `nums`. Update the variable `req` after the correction.

class Solution {
    public int halveArray(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Double> q = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            q.add((double) i);
        }
        int res = 0;
        double req = 0;  // Corrected initialization of req
        for (double num : q) {
            req += num;  // Corrected calculation of req
        }
        req /= 2;  // Corrected calculation of req
        
        while (sum > req) {
            double curr = q.poll();
            q.add(curr / 2);
            res++;
            sum -= curr
