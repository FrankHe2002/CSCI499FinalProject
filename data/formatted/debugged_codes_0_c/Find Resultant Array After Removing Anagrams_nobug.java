The code is trying to remove anagrams from an array of words. Anagrams are words that have the same characters but in a different order. 

The logic in the code seems correct. It converts each word to a char array, sorts the characters in ascending order, and then converts the sorted array back to a string. This way, if two words are anagrams, their sorted representations will be the same.

However, there is a bug in the code on line 5. It is missing the import statement for ArrayList and Arrays. To fix this, we need to add the following import statements at the top of the file:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
```

With these import statements added, the code should work correctly. The bug is a missing import statement.
