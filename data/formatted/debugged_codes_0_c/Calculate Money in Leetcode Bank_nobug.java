Bug Type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning:
1. The code aims to calculate the total amount of money that will be received for n number of weeks. 
2. It starts by calculating the number of full weeks (m) by dividing n by 7.
3. Then, it calculates the sum of money for each full week by using the formula 7 * (i + 3), where i ranges from 1 to m.
4. Next, it calculates the sum of money for the remaining days (less than a full week) by incrementing m and adding it to the result.
5. Finally, it returns the total amount of money (res).

There is an off-by-one error in the second for loop. The loop condition should be i <= n instead of i < n. This error causes the loop to run one iteration short, resulting in the incorrect calculation for the remaining days.

Fix:
Change the loop condition in the second for loop from "i < n" to "i <= n".

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int totalMoney(int n) {
        int m = n / 7; //(no.of full weeks)
        // first week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (sum is 28 i.e. 7*(i+3) if i=1)
        // second week 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (sum is 35 i.e. 7*(i+3) if i=2)
        //.... so on
        int res = 0; //for result
        //calculating full weeks
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            res += 7 * (i + 3);
        }
        //calculating left days
        for (int i = 7 * m; i <= n; i++) {
            res += ++ m;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
