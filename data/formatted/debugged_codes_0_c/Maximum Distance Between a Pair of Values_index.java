The bug in the provided Java code is the inconsistency in the comparison logic inside the while loop. 

1. Initially, we set `l` to `i` and `r` to `nums2.length - 1`. 
2. Then, we calculate `m` as the middle index between `l` and `r`.
3. If `nums1[i] > nums2[m + 1]`, we update `r` to `m - 1`. This implies that `nums1[i]` is greater than all elements to the right of `nums2[m]`.
4. If `nums1[i] == nums2[m]`, we update `l` to `m + 1`. This implies that `nums1[i]` is equal to `nums2[m]`.
5. If `nums1[i]` is neither greater nor equal to `nums2[m]`, we still update `l` to `m + 1`. This implies that `nums1[i]` is not less than `nums2[m]`, but it doesn't provide any information about the relationship between `nums1[i]` and `nums2[m]`.
6. The loop continues until `l` is no longer less than or equal to `r`.

To fix this bug, we should update the third condition in the while loop to handle the case when `nums1[i]` is less than `nums2[m]`. We can change the line `l = m + 1;` to `r = m - 1;`. This will update `r` to `m - 1` when `nums1[i]` is less than `nums2[m]`. 

Here's the fixed code:

class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            int r = nums2.length - 1;
            int l = i;
            int m = i;
            while (l <= r) {
                m = l + (r - l) / 2;
                if (nums1[i] > nums2[m + 1]) {
                    r = m - 1;
                } else if (nums1[i] ==
