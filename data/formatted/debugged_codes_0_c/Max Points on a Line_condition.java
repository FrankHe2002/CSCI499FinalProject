The bug in the provided Java code is in the outer for loop condition in the maxPoints() method. The condition should be `i < n` instead of `i >= n`. 

To identify the bug, we can carefully examine the code and look for any syntax errors or logical issues. In this case, the issue is a logical error as the condition is not properly defined.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the for loop to `i < n`. This will ensure that the loop iterates from 0 to n-1, inclusive.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        int n = points.length;
        if (n == 1) return n;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                result = Math.max(result, getPoints(i, j, points));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    private int getPoints(int pt1, int pt2, int[][] points) {
        int[] point1 = points[pt1], point2 = points[pt2];
        double slope = (point1[1] - point2[1]) / (double) (point1[0] - point2[0]);
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            if ((points[i][0] == point1[0] && points[i][1] == point1[1]) ||
                    (slope == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY && (point1[1] - points[i][1]) / (double) (point1[0] - points[i][0]) == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) ||
                    ((double) (point1[1] - points[i][1]) / (double) (point1[0] - points[i][0]) == slope))
                result++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

By fixing this bug, the code should now work as intended.
