There is a bug in the `addAtIndex` method. 

The bug occurs when `index` is greater than the current length of the linked list. In this case, the method should not add the new node because it would be out of bounds. However, the current implementation adds the node at the end of the list instead.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `index` is greater than `length` and return without making any changes if it is.

```java
public void addAtIndex(int index, int val) {
    if (index > length) {
        return;
    }
    // rest of the method...
}
```

This will ensure that the method only adds the new node if `index` is less than or equal to `length`, and avoids adding the node at an out-of-bounds index.
