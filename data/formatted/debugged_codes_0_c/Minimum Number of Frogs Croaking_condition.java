Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
- The code uses an array `count` to keep track of the count of each character in the given string `croakOfFrogs`.
- The array `count` has a size of 5, but the loop that updates the count does not check for the special case of the character 'k'.
- When the character 'k' is encountered, the code attempts to access `count[i]` where `i` is the index of 'k' (which is 4 in the given code).
- Since `count` has a size of 5, the valid indices are 0 to 4, so accessing index 4 will result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.


Fix:
- Add a condition to check if the character is 'k' before updating the count and sum, and skip the updating step if the character is 'k'.

class Solution {
    public int minNumberOfFrogs(String croakOfFrogs) {
        int[] index = new int[26];
        String corak = "croak";

        // Giving index to each characters
        for (int i = 0; i < corak.length(); ++ i)
            index[corak.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;

        int ans = 0, sum = 0;
        int[] count = new int[5];

        for (char c : croakOfFrogs.toCharArray()) {
            int i = index[c - 'a'];
            // If it is not 'c' it will decrease the sum
            if (c == 'c') {
                if (count[i - 1]-- <= 0) return - 1;
                sum--;
            }
            // If it is not 'k' it will increase the sum
            if (c != 'k') {
                if (i == 4) continue; // Skip updating count and sum if character is 'k'
                count[i]++;
                sum++;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, sum);
        }
        return sum == 0 ? ans : - 1;
    }
