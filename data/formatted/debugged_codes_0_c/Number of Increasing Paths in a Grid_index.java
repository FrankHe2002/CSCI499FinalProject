Bug type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes the 2D array `dp` with dimensions `grid.length` and `grid[0].length`.
2. The `dfs` method is recursively called from the `countPaths` method for each element in the `grid` array.
3. In the `dfs` method, the base case checks if the current indices `i` and `j` are out of bounds of the `grid` array.
4. However, there is a bug in the second base case where it checks `grid[i][1] <= pre` instead of `grid[i][j] <= pre`.
5. This bug causes the code to access elements outside the bounds of the `grid` array, leading to an Array Index Out of Bounds error.

To fix the bug, change `grid[i][1] <= pre` to `grid[i][j] <= pre` in the second base case of the `dfs` method.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    long[][] dp;
    int mod = 1_000_000_007;

    public int countPaths(int[][] grid) {
        dp = new long[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        long sum = 0L;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                sum = (sum + dfs(grid, i, j, 0)) % mod;
            }
        }
        return (int) sum;
    }

    long dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j, int pre) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length) return 0;
        if (grid[i][j] <= pre) return 0;
        if (dp[i][j] > 0) return dp[i][j];
        long a = dfs(grid, i + 1, j, grid[i][j]);
        long b = dfs(grid, i, j + 1, grid[i][j]);
        long c = dfs(grid, i - 1, j, grid[i][j]);
        long d = dfs(grid, i, j - 1, grid[i][j]);
        dp[i][j] = (1 + a + b + c + d) % mod;
        return
