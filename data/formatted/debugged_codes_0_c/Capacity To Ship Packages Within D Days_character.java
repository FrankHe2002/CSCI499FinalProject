The bug in the provided code is a missing semicolon on line 8. This causes a compilation error.

To identify the bug, we can start by carefully reviewing the code and looking for syntax errors, logic errors, and potential runtime issues.

In this case, we notice that there is a missing semicolon on line 8, where the `right` variable is updated by adding the `weight` to it. This missing semicolon causes a compilation error.

To fix the bug, we simply need to add a semicolon after the line:

```java
right += weight;
```

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        //  left is the biggest element in the array. It's set as the lower boundary.
        //  right is the sum of the array, which is the upper limit. 
        for (int weight : weights) {
            left = Math.max(weight, left);
            right += weight;
        }
        int res = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            // make sure mid is a possible value 
            if (isPossible(weights, days, mid)) {
                res = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    public boolean isPossible(int[] weights, int days, int mid) {
        int totalDays = 1;
        int totalWeight = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            totalWeight += weights[i];
            // increase totalDays if totalWeight is larger than mid
            if (totalWeight > mid) {
                totalDays++;
                totalWeight = weights[i];
            }
            // the problem states all the packages have to ship within `days` days 
            if (totalDays > days) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

By adding the missing semicolon, the code should now compile correctly.
