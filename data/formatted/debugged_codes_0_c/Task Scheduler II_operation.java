Based on the given code, the bug seems to be in the calculation of the day variable. 

Here's the reasoning process to identify and fix the bug:

1. Initialize a HashMap to keep track of the last occurrence day of each task.
2. Initialize the day variable as 0.
3. Loop through each task in the given tasks array.
4. Check if the task is already present in the HashMap. If it is, compare its last occurrence day with the current day value. If the last occurrence day is greater than the current day, update the current day with the last occurrence day.
    - The bug: The if condition is incorrect. It should check if the last occurrence day is greater than or equal to the current day, not just greater than.
    - Incorrect line: `if (map.containsKey(item) && map.get(item) > day)`
    - Corrected line: `if (map.containsKey(item) && map.get(item) >= day)`
5. Increment the current day by 1.
6. Update the HashMap with the current day minus the space value as the last occurrence day for the current task.
    - The bug: The calculation of the last occurrence day is incorrect. It should be `day + space`, not `day - space`.
    - Incorrect line: `map.put(item, day - space)`
    - Corrected line: `map.put(item, day + space)`
7. Finally, return the day variable.

Here's the corrected Java code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public long taskSchedulerII(int[] tasks, int space) {
        HashMap<Integer, Long> map = new HashMap<>();
        long day = 0;

        for (int item : tasks) {
            if (map.containsKey(item) && map.get(item) >= day)
                day = map.get(item);

            day++;
            map.put(item, day + space);
        }

        return day;
    }
}
```
