The code seems to have a bug in the for loop at line 50. The condition should be `i <= k` instead of `i > k`. This is because the loop should iterate while `i` is less than or equal to `k`, in order to consider all possible values of `i` within the given range.

To fix the bug, the condition in the for loop at line 50 should be changed to `i <= k`.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= k && i <= count; i++) {
    // rest of the code
}
```

This change ensures that all possible values of `i` within the given range are considered and the correct calculations are performed.
