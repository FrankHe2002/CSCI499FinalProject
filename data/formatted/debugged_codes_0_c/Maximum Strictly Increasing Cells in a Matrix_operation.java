The bug in the code is in the line:
```
cur = Math.max(colSubMaxVals[col] / 1, cur);
```
The division operator ("/") should be changed to the addition operator ("+"). The correct line should be:
```
cur = Math.max(colSubMaxVals[col] + 1, cur);
```

To identify the bug, we first need to understand the logic of the code and what it is trying to achieve. 

The code is trying to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a 2D matrix. It does this by iterating through all the cells in the matrix and keeping track of the maximum increasing subsequence length for each row and column. It also keeps track of the second highest value for each row and column.

The bug is introduced when calculating the length of the increasing subsequence for the columns. Instead of adding 1 to the second highest value (`colSubMaxVals[col] + 1`), the code incorrectly divides the value by 1 (`colSubMaxVals[col] / 1`), which has no effect on the value.

To fix the bug, we just need to change the division operator to the addition operator in the line mentioned above. The corrected line should be:
```
cur = Math.max(colSubMaxVals[col] + 1, cur);
```

This fix ensures that the correct length of the increasing subsequence is calculated for both the row and the column.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxIncreasingCells(int[][] mat) {
        int m = mat.length, n = mat[0].length;
        int[] rows = new int[m], cols = new int[n];
        int[] rowMaxVals = new int[m], colMaxVals = new int[n];

        int[] rowSubMaxVals = new int[m], colSubMaxVals = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            rows[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cols[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }
        PriorityQueue<int[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((int[] a, int[] b) -> {
            return a[0] - b[0];
        });
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                queue
