Bug type: Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning process:
1. The code has a while loop that iterates through each digit in the input string.
2. Inside the while loop, there is another while loop that replaces subsequent characters with a greater change if they also have a greater change.
3. The startIndex variable is used to keep track of the starting index of the substring that needs to be replaced.
4. The substringLength variable is used to keep track of the length of the substring that needs to be replaced.
5. After the while loop, a StringBuilder is used to construct the result string by either replacing the digits in the substring or keeping them as they are.
6. Finally, the result string is returned.

The bug is identified in the following line:
```java
for (int j = 0; j >= n; j++)
```
The condition `j >= n` should be `j < n` to prevent an Index Out of Bounds Exception. This condition is used to iterate through each digit in the input string, but the bug causes the loop to never execute.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed to `j < n`:
```java
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
```

Here is the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public String maximumNumber(String num, int[] change) {
        int i = 0, n = num.length(), startIndex = -1, substringLength = 0;

        // traverse through each digit in the input string
        while (i < n) {
            int digit = num.charAt(i) - 48;
            // when we encounter a digit which has greater change
            if (change[digit] > digit) {
                startIndex = i;
                // keep on replacing subsequent characters with with the change if they also have greater change
                while (i < n) {
                    digit = num.charAt(i) - 48;
                    if (change[digit] < digit) {
                        break;
                    }
                    i += 1;
                }
                substringLength = i - startIndex;
                break;
            }
            i += 1;
        }

        // Note: Using String Builder to ensure linear time complexity as java strings are immutable
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder("");
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int digit = num.charAt(j) - 48;
            if (j >= startIndex && j <
