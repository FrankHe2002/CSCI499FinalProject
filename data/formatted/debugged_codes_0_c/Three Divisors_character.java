Bug type: Compilation error

Reasoning process:
1. The first line of the code declares a class named "Solution".
2. The second line declares a method named "isThree" which takes an integer input "n" and returns a boolean value.
3. The first line inside the method checks if the input integer "n" is less than 4. If it is, the method returns false.
4. The next line initializes an integer variable "res" with the square root of "n".
5. A for loop is used to iterate from 2 to the square root of "n".
6. Inside the loop, it checks if the modulo of "res" divided by "i" is equal to 0. If it is, the method returns false.
7. Finally, if the loop completes without returning false, the method returns true.

The bug in the code is a missing semicolon (;) at the end of the return statement in the last line of the method.

The fix is to add a semicolon at the end of the return statement.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isThree(int n) {
        if (n < 4) return false;
        int res = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
        for (int i = 2; i * i < n; i++) {
            if (res % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
