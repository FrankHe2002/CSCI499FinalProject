Bug Type: Floating Point Division Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code is calculating the aspect ratio of each rectangle by dividing its width by its height.
2. The aspect ratio is stored as a `Double` in the `tmp` variable.
3. However, the division operation `(double) (rectangles[i][0] / (double) rectangles[i][1])` is performed using integer division first and then cast to a `double`.
4. This can lead to incorrect aspect ratios when the division operation results in a non-integer value.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the division operation is performed using floating-point division.

Modified Code:
```java
class Solution {

    public long interchangeableRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
        Map<Double, Long> hash = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < rectangles.length; i++) {
            Double tmp = (double) rectangles[i][0] / rectangles[i][1];

            hash.put(tmp, hash.getOrDefault(tmp, 0L) + 1);
        }

        long ans = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<Double, Long> entry : hash.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > 1) {
                Long n = entry.getValue();
                ans += (n * (n - 1)) / 2;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
