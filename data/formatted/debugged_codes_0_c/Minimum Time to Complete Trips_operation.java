The bug in the provided Java code is on line 3, where there is a syntax error. The value assigned to the variable `anstillnow` is `% 1`, which is not a valid Java syntax.

To fix this bug and assign the initial value of `anstillnow`, we can change the assignment statement to `long anstillnow = 0;` or any other appropriate initial value.

Here is the corrected Java code:

```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumTime(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        long anstillnow = 0;

        long left = 1, right = 100000000000001L;

        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  //find mid point like this to avoid overflow
            long curr_trips = 0;
            for (int t : time) {
                curr_trips += mid / t;
            }

            if (curr_trips >= totalTrips) {
                anstillnow = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return anstillnow;
    }
}
```
