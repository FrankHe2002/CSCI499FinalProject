The bug in the provided code is that it does not consider the case when the given string is already balanced. 

To identify this bug, we need to understand the logic of the code. The code uses a stack to remove the balanced part from the given string. It iterates through each character of the string. If the character is an opening bracket '[' it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket ']' and the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an opening bracket '[', then the opening bracket is popped from the stack. Otherwise, the closing bracket is pushed onto the stack.

After processing all the characters, the size of the stack divided by 2 gives the number of unbalanced opening or closing brackets. Then, (unb + 1) divided by 2 gives the minimum number of swaps required to balance the string.

However, the code does not handle the case when the given string is already balanced, i.e., there are no unbalanced opening or closing brackets. In this case, the code incorrectly returns a non-zero value.

To fix this bug, we can check if the stack is empty after processing all the characters. If the stack is empty, it means that there are no unbalanced opening or closing brackets, and we can return 0.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '[')
                stack.push(ch);
            else {
                if (! stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '[')
                    stack.pop();
                else
                    stack.push(ch);
            }
        }

        if (stack.isEmpty()) // check if the stack is empty
            return 0;

        int unb = stack.size() / 2;
        return (unb + 1) / 2;
    }
}
```
