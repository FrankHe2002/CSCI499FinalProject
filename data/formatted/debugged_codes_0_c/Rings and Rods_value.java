There are several bugs in the provided Java code.

1. Bug: Incorrect index calculation for the ring.
   - Reasoning: In the for loop, the index is calculated incorrectly by casting the character at `i + 2` to an integer, which results in an incorrect index value.
   - Fix: Change the index calculation to `int index = Character.getNumericValue(rings.charAt(i + 1));`.

2. Bug: Overwriting existing characters in the set for the same index.
   - Reasoning: The code incorrectly checks if the map already contains the index and overwrites the value with the new character, instead of adding the character to the existing set.
   - Fix: Update the block to add the character to the existing set only if it is not present.

3. Bug: Incorrect check for set size.
   - Reasoning: The code checks if a set's size is equal to 3, which implies that all characters within the set must be different. However, the prompt does not specify this requirement.
   - Fix: Update the check to see if the set's size is greater than or equal to 3.

Here's the corrected code considering the above fixes:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countPoints(String rings) {
        Map<Integer, Set<Character>> m = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < rings.length(); i = i + 2) {
            char c = rings.charAt(i);
            int index = Character.getNumericValue(rings.charAt(i + 1));
            if (m.containsKey(index)) {
                Set<Character> x = m.get(index);
                if (!x.contains(c)) {
                    x.add(c);
                }
            } else {
                Set<Character> x = new HashSet<>();
                x.add(c);
                m.put(index, x);
            }
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (Set<Character> k : m.values()) {
            if (k.size() >= 3) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
