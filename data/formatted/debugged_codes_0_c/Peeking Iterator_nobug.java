The bug in the provided code is that it does not implement the `Iterator` interface methods properly. The `PeekingIterator` class is supposed to extend the `Iterator` interface and override its methods, but it is missing the import statement and the declaration for the `Iterator` interface.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

// Java Iterator interface reference:
// https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html

class PeekingIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {
    Queue<Integer> q;

    public PeekingIterator(Iterator<Integer> iterator) {
        // initialize any member here.
        q = new LinkedList<>();
        while (iterator.hasNext())
            q.add(iterator.next());
    }

    // Returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator.
    public Integer peek() {
        return q.peek();
    }

    // hasNext() and next() should behave the same as in the Iterator interface.
    // Override them if needed.
    @Override
    public Integer next() {
        return q.remove();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return q.size() != 0;
    }

    @Override
    public void remove() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
}
```

The fix involves adding the missing import statement `import java.util.Iterator;` at the top of the code and extending the `Iterator` interface to properly implement its methods. Additionally, the code should throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` for the `remove()` method since it is not supported in this implementation.
