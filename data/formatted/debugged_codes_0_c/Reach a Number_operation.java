Bug type: 
- Logical bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code starts by initializing the variables `sum` and `steps` to 0.
2. It checks if the `target` is 0: `if (target == 0) return 0;`. If `target` is indeed 0, the code returns 0 and execution stops.
3. The code then takes the absolute value of `target`.
4. In the first `while` loop, the code increments `sum` by `steps` and increments `steps` by 1 in each iteration, until `sum` becomes greater than or equal to `target`.
5. In the second `while` loop, the code increments `sum` by `steps` and increments `steps` by 1 in each iteration, until the difference between `sum` and `target` is odd.
6. Finally, the code returns `steps` multiplied by 1.

The logic seems correct and there are no syntax errors. However, there is a bug in the second `while` loop. The condition `((sum - target) % 2 != 0)` should be `((sum - target) % 2 == 0)`. The reason is that we want the difference between `sum` and `target` to be even, not odd, in order to reach the target.

Fix:
Change the condition in the second `while` loop from `((sum - target) % 2 != 0)` to `((sum - target) % 2 == 0)`.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        int sum = 0, steps = 0;
        if (target == 0) return 0;
        target = Math.abs(target);
        while (sum < target) {
            sum += steps;
            steps++;
        }

        while (((sum - target) % 2 == 0)) {
            sum += steps;
            steps++;
        }
        return steps * 1;

    }
}
```
