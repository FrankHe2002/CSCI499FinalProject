Bug type: Off-by-one Error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to generate all possible binary search trees given a range of values from 1 to n.
2. The recursive `helper` method is supposed to take a range (lo to hi) and generate all possible binary search trees within that range.
3. The bug occurs in the `generateTrees` method, where it calls the `helper` method with the range (2 to n) instead of (1 to n).
4. This bug causes the code to skip generating binary search trees with a root value of 1.

Fix:
Change the `generateTrees` method to call the `helper` method with the range (1 to n) instead of (2 to n).

```java
public List<TreeNode> generateTrees(int n) {
    return helper(1, n);
}
```
