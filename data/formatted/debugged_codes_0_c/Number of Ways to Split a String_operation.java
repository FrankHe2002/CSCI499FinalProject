The bug in the provided Java code is the calculation of the number of ways to split the string. 

To determine the number of ways to split the string, the code counts the number of '1' characters in the string and checks if it is divisible by 3. If it is not divisible by 3, the code returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of ones that should be present in each part, and then iterates through the characters in the string to count the number of ways to split the string into two parts.

The bug in the code lies in the calculation of the number of ways to split the string. The calculation uses the variables `part1` and `part2` to count the number of ways to split the string, but it mistakenly increments `part1` and `part2` each time `one` reaches a certain value, instead of incrementing them when `one` reaches multiples of `ones`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions in the second for loop to check if `one` is a multiple of `ones`, instead of checking for specific values. Additionally, we need to initialize `part1` and `part2` to 1 instead of 0 since there is at least one way to split the string when it is divisible by 3.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWays(String s) {
        long n = s.length();
        long one = 0;//to count number of ones
        long mod = 1_000_000_007;
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < c.length; i++) {
            if (c[i] == '1')
                one++;
        }

        //there will be 3 cases
        // 1.no ones present in the string
        // 2.number of ones present in the string isnt divisible by 3(since we need to cut 3 parts)
        // 3.number of ones divisible by 3

        if (one == 0)//case 1
        {
            return (int) ((((n - 1) * (n - 2)) / 2) % mod);
        }
        if (one % 3 != 0)//case 2,which means we cant split ones equally
            return 0;
        //case 3
        long ones = one / 3;//number of ones that should be
