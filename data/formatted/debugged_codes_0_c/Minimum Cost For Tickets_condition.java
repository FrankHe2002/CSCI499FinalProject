Bug type: Index out of bounds

Reasoning process:
1. The code initializes the variable `n` with the last element of the `days` array.
2. The `dp` array is initialized with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is the maximum value in the `days` array. However, there is a bug as the last index of the `dp` array should be `n`, not `n+1`.
3. The `for` loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. This means that the loop does not consider the last index of the `dp` array, resulting in an index out of bounds issue when trying to access `dp[n]` in the last line of the code.
4. To fix the bug, the `for` loop should iterate from `1` to `n` instead of `1` to `n-1`. Additionally, the last line of the code should return `dp[n-1]` instead of `dp[n]` to match the size of the `dp` array.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int mincostTickets(int[] days, int[] costs) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int day : days) set.add(day);
        int n = days[days.length - 1];
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // Iterate up to n (included)
            if (!set.contains(i)) {
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
                continue;
            }
            int a = dp[Math.max(0, i - 1)] + costs[0];
            int b = dp[Math.max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1];
            int c = dp[Math.max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2];
            dp[i] = Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c));
        }
        return dp[n - 1]; // Return dp[n-1] instead of dp[n]
    }
}
```
