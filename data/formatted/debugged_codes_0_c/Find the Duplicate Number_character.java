Bug Type: Off-by-one Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code is trying to find a duplicate number in an array by using the swapping technique.
2. The array is expected to contain a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array.
3. The code compares each element of the array with its expected value (i + 1).
4. If the element is not at its correct position, the code tries to swap it with the element at its correct position.
5. If the element at its correct position is the same as the current element, it means that a duplicate has been found.
6. The code continues this process until it reaches the end of the array or finds a duplicate.

Bug:
The bug in the code is with the following line:
```java
int correct = nums[i] - 1;
```
Since the array is expected to contain a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, the correct index should be `nums[i] - 1` instead of `nums[i]`.

Fix:
```java
int correct = nums[i] - 1;
```

Corrected Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < nums.length) {

            if (nums[i] != i + 1) {
                int correct = nums[i] - 1;
                if (nums[i] != nums[correct]) {
                    swap(nums, i, correct);
                } else {
                    return nums[i];
                }
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    static void swap(int[] arr, int first, int second) {
        int temp = arr[first];
        arr[first] = arr[second];
        arr[second] = temp;
    }
}
```
