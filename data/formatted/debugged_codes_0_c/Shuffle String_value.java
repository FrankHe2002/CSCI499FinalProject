The provided Java code appears to be correct and does not contain any bugs. 

The code represents a solution to a problem where a string `s` and an array `indices` are given. The task is to restore the original string by rearranging the characters in `s` according to the given indices. 

The code initializes a character array `ch` with the same length as `s`. It then iterates over each character in `s`, and assigns the character to the `indices[i]` position in the `ch` array. Finally, it converts the character array `ch` to a string and returns the result.

No bugs have been identified in the code. The code handles all possible inputs correctly and produces the expected result.
