Bug Type: None

Explanation:
Upon reviewing the code, there doesn't seem to be any apparent bugs or errors. 
The code uses a HashSet to keep track of characters in the given string 's'. It iterates through each character of the string using a enhanced-for loop.
If a character is already present in the HashSet, it means it is a repeated character and the method returns the character.
If no character is found to be repeated, the method returns a space character (' ').

The code seems to be logically correct, and there are no compilation errors.

So, no bug exists in the given code.
