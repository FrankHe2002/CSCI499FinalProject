The provided Java code is using two functions `nsl` and `nsr` to calculate two arrays `ans1` and `ans2` respectively. These arrays are then used in a loop to calculate the sum. 

To identify the bug, we need to carefully analyze the code and its logic. 

1. The code is using a stack in both `nsl` and `nsr` functions to keep track of indices.
2. In the `nsl` function, the stack is used to keep track of the indices of the previous smaller elements.
3. In the `nsr` function, the stack is used to keep track of the indices of the next smaller elements.
4. The calculated values from `nsl` and `nsr` are then used in a loop to calculate the sum.

There doesn't seem to be any syntax errors or obvious logical errors in the code. However, there is a potential bug in the loop where the sum is calculated. 

In the loop, the indexing is starting from -1. This is incorrect because array indices start from 0 in Java. So, the loop should start from 0 instead of -1.

To fix this bug, we need to change the loop initialization from `for (int i = -1; i < n; i++)` to `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`.

Here is the revised code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumSubarrayMins(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int ans1[] = nsl(arr);
        int ans2[] = nsr(arr);
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum = (sum + (long) (arr[i] * (long) (ans1[i] * ans2[i]) % 1000000007) % 1000000007) % 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) sum;
    }

    public static int[] nsl(int arr[]) {
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
        int ans[] = new int[arr.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            while (! s.isEmpty() && arr[i] < arr[s.peek()]) {
                s.pop();
            }
            if (s.isEmpty()) {
                ans[i] = i - (- 1);
