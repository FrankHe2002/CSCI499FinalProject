The bug in the code is on line 22, where the condition in the for loop should be `i < 10` instead of `i <= 10`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int nextBeautifulNumber(int n) {

        while (true) {
            n++;
            int num = n; //test this number
            int[] freq = new int[10]; // 0 to 9

            while (num > 0) { //calculate freq of each digit in the num
                int rem = num % 10; //this is remainder
                num = num / 10; //this is quotient
                freq[rem] = freq[rem] + 1; //increase its frequency
                if (freq[rem] > rem) break;
            }

            boolean ans = true;

            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { //check frequency of each digit
                if (freq[i] != i && freq[i] != 0) {
                    ans = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (ans == true) {
                return n;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the code, I identified the bug by carefully reading the code and noticing that the index in the for loop should only go up to 9. The code mistakenly checks the frequency of the digit 10, which is outside the range of the frequency array. To fix the bug, I simply changed the condition in the for loop to `i < 10` to correctly iterate over the frequencies of digits 0 to 9.
