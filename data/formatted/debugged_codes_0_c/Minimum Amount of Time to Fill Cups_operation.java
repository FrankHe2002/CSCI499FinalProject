Bug type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The code first sorts the `amount` array in ascending order.
2. Then it assigns the values of the first three elements of the sorted array to variables `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively.
3. The code calculates the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` and assigns it to the variable `sum`.
4. If `x + y` is greater than `z`, it returns `sum / 2 + sum % 2`. This means that if the sum of the two smallest numbers is greater than the largest number, it returns the average of the sum (rounded up if necessary).
5. If `x` and `y` are both 0, it returns `z`. Otherwise, it also returns `z`.

The bug:
The bug lies in the logic that checks if `x + y` is greater than `z`. If `x` and `y` are both 0, the code incorrectly returns `z` regardless of the value of `z`. This means that if `z` is 0, the code should return 0, but it returns the incorrect value of `z` instead.

**Fix:**
To fix the bug, we should first check if `x` and `y` are both 0. If they are, we should directly return 0. Otherwise, we should check if the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than `z` and return the correct value based on that condition.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int fillCups(int[] amount) {
        Arrays.sort(amount);
        int x = amount[0];
        int y = amount[1];
        int z = amount[2];
        int sum = x + y + z;
        
        if (x == 0 && y == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (x + y > z) {
            return sum / 2 + sum % 2;
        } else {
            return z;
        }
    }
}
