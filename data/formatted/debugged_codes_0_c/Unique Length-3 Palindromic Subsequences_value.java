Bug type: Off-by-one error.

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to count the number of palindromic subsequences in the given string.
2. It first initializes two arrays, `firstOcc` and `lastOcc`, to keep track of the first and last occurrence of each character in the string.
3. Then, it loops through each character in the string and updates the first and last occurrences in the arrays.
4. Next, it loops through 52 characters (26 lowercase letters and 26 uppercase letters) and checks for each character if it can be the start or end of a palindrome.
5. Inside this loop, it initializes a boolean array, `visited`, to keep track of the unique characters in the middle of the palindrome.
6. Then, it loops through the indices `si + 1` to `ei` (the range of indices within which the current character can be the start or end of a palindrome) and counts the unique characters in the middle.
7. Finally, it adds the count to the answer.
8. The code returns the final answer.

Bug fix:
The bug in the code is the loop condition in line 32: `i < 52`. This condition allows the loop to run for 52 iterations instead of the intended 26 iterations.
To fix this bug, we should change the loop condition to `i < 26` to loop through the 26 characters (lowercase letters) only.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            char ch = chArr[i];
