In Solution 1, the bug is in the following line:
```java
int row = indices[i + 2][0];
```
The index `i + 2` is used to access the `indices` array, which will cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because `i + 2` can go beyond the bounds of the `indices` array. The correct index should be `i` to access the current row index.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line to:
```java
int row = indices[i][0];
```

In Solution 2, there is no bug. The code correctly initializes the `row` and `col` arrays with zeros and updates the counts based on the indices. The counter is then calculated by iterating over the `row` and `col` arrays.

Here is the corrected and unchanged Solution 1 code:

```java
// --------------------- Solution 1 ---------------------
class Solution {
    public int oddCells(int m, int n, int[][] indices) {
        int[][] matrix = new int[m][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
            int row = indices[i][0];
            int col = indices[i][1];

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                matrix[row][j]++;
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                matrix[j][col]++;
            }
        }

        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] % 2 != 0) {
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }

        return counter;
    }
}
```
