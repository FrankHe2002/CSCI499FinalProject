After reviewing the given Java code, I have identified the bug. The bug is that the code calculates the lengths of the two linked lists, `headA` and `headB`, but after that, it adjusts the starting points of both linked lists based on their lengths. This adjustment is incorrect because it skips nodes in the longer linked list, resulting in incorrect intersection detection.

To fix the bug, I would make the following changes to the code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode tempA = headA, tempB = headB;
        int lenA = 0, lenB = 0;
        while (tempA != null) {
            lenA++;
            tempA = tempA.next;
        }
        while (tempB != null) {
            lenB++;
            tempB = tempB.next;
        }
        tempA = headA;
        tempB = headB;
        int diff = Math.abs(lenA - lenB); // calculate the absolute difference
        if (lenB > lenA) {
            for (int i = 0; i < diff; i++) {
                tempB = tempB.next;
            }
        } else if (lenA > lenB) {
            for (int i = 0; i < diff; i++) {
                tempA = tempA.next;
            }
        }
        while (tempA != null && tempA != tempB) {
            tempA = tempA.next;
            tempB = tempB.next;
        }
        return tempA;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, I introduced a new variable `diff` to keep track of the absolute difference between `lenA` and `lenB`. This difference is then used to adjust the starting points of the two linked lists. By doing so, the code will correctly handle cases where the two linked lists have different lengths.
