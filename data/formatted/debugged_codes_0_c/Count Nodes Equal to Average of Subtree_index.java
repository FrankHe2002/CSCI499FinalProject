The bug in the provided code is in the `dfs` method, specifically in the calculation of `currSum`. 

```java
int currSum = left[node] + right[0] + node.val;
```

The bug occurs because `left` and `right` are arrays, but the code is using `node` as an index instead of using the correct indices, which are `0` and `1`. 

To fix this bug, we need to change `left[node]` to `left[0]` and `right[0]` to `right[1]` to get the correct values from the arrays. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    int res = 0;

    public int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return res;
    }

    private int[] dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return new int[] {0, 0};
        }

        int[] left = dfs(node.left);
        int[] right = dfs(node.right);

        int currSum = left[0] + right[1] + node.val;
        int currCount = left[1] + right[1] + 1;

        if (currSum / currCount == node.val) {
            res++;
        }

        return new int[] {currSum, currCount};
    }
}
```

With these changes, the bug is fixed and the code should work as intended.
