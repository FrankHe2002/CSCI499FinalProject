The provided code determines the number of ways to split a string "s" into two non-empty substrings such that the number of distinct characters in each substring is equal. Let's review the code for any potential bugs:

1. The code initializes two arrays `a` and `b` of size 26 each, which will store the count of each character in string `s`. The indices of these arrays correspond to the lowercase alphabet characters (i.e. 'a' is represented by index 0, 'b' by index 1, and so on).
2. The variables `ds1` and `ds2` are initialized to 0. These variables will store the count of distinct characters in substrings on the left and right sides of the split, respectively.
3. The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of valid splits.

Next, the code updates the counts of characters in `b` and increments `ds2` for each character encountered in `s`. This loop helps us determine the initial count of distinct characters on the right side of each split.

After that, another loop is used to iterate through `s` and update the counts of characters in `a` and `b`. It also tracks the changes in the distinct character counts `ds1` and `ds2` as each character is encountered. Whenever `ds1` becomes equal to `ds2`, `count` is incremented to represent a valid split.

There is no bug in the code. It correctly calculates the number of valid splits satisfying the given condition. However, we can make a few minor improvements:

1. Instead of subtracting 97 from each character's ASCII value (`s.charAt(i) - 97`), we can optimize it by using `(s.charAt(i) - 'a')`. This will give us the equivalent index in the arrays `a` and `b`.
2. We can combine the two loops into one, eliminating the need for two separate loops through `s`.

Here is the modified code with the suggested improvements:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSplits(String s) {
        int a[] = new int[26];
        int b[] = new int[26];
        int ds1 = 0, ds2 = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            int index = ch -
