Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the variable `count` is initialized to 1. Then, for each character `c` in the `text`, if `c` is equal to a space, `isBad` is set to false and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `isBad` is false and `c` is in `brokenLetters`, `isBad` is set to true and `count` is decremented by 1. 

One possible bug in this code is that if the last word in the `text` does not contain any broken letters, the count will be incorrect. This is because the count is incremented by 1 for each space, even if the word before the space does not contain any broken letters.

To fix this bug, we can add a check after the for loop ends to see if the last word in the `text` contains any broken letters. If it doesn't, decrement the count by 1.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 8 ms (Top 25.13%) | Memory: 42.1 MB (Top 88.13%)
class Solution {
    public int canBeTypedWords(String text, String brokenLetters) {
        int count = 1;
        boolean isBad = false;
        for (char c : text.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == ' ') {
                isBad = false;
                count++;
            } else {
                if (!isBad && brokenLetters.indexOf(c) != - 1) {
                    isBad = true;
                    count--;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (!isBad && brokenLetters.indexOf(text.charAt(text.length()-1)) != -1) {
            count--;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
