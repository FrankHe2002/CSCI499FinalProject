The code provided calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of `nums` equal. However, there is a bug in the code. 

The bug occurs in the line `odd *= res >> 5;`. This line is attempting to update the `odd` variable, but it is using the multiplication operator `*=` instead of the addition operator `+=`. This means that the `odd` variable will always be `0` because it is multiplied by `res >> 5`, which is always `0`.

To fix this bug, we should change `odd *= res >> 5;` to `odd += res >> 5;`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int odd = 0, even = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int n : nums) {
            int res = dfs(n, map);
            odd += res >> 5;
            even = Math.max(res & 0b11111, even);
        }

        return odd + even;
    }

    private int dfs(int n, Map<Integer, Integer> map) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (map.containsKey(n)) return map.get(n);

        int res = n % 2 << 5;
        res += dfs(n / 2, map) + (n > 1 ? 1 : 0);

        map.put(n, res);
        return res;
    }
}
```
