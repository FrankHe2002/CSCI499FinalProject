The provided Java code implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using a doubly linked list and a hashmap. 

To identify and fix the bug, we need to review the code and understand its functionality. Let's go through the code step-by-step:

1. The `LRUCache` class is declared, which contains the implementation of the LRU Cache.

2. Within the `LRUCache` class, there is a nested class `Node`, which represents a node in the doubly linked list. Each `Node` contains a `key` and a `value`, as well as `next` and `prev` pointers.

3. The `LRUCache` class has the following member variables:
   - `head` and `tail` nodes to represent the start and end of the doubly linked list.
   - `mp`, a hashmap to store the key-value pairs and the corresponding node in the doubly linked list.
   - `cap`, an integer representing the capacity of the LRU Cache.

4. The `LRUCache` class has a constructor that initializes the capacity, sets up the head and tail nodes, and creates the hashmap.

5. The `get` method takes a key as input, checks if the key exists in the hashmap, and if it does, retrieves the corresponding node from the hashmap. It then calls the `del` method to remove the node from its current position in the doubly linked list, and calls the `ins` method to reinsert the node after the head node. Finally, it returns the value of the retrieved node.

6. The `put` method takes a key-value pair as input and adds it to the cache. If the key already exists in the hashmap, it removes the corresponding node from the hashmap and the doubly linked list. If the size of the hashmap is equal to the capacity, it removes the node before the tail node from the hashmap and the doubly linked list. It then creates a new node with the given key-value pair, inserts it after the head node in the doubly linked list, and adds it to the hashmap.

7. The `ins` method is used to insert a node after the head node in the doubly linked list. It updates the pointers of the existing nodes accordingly.

8. The `del` method is used to remove a specified node from the doubly linked list. It updates the pointers of the nodes before and after the specified node to bypass it.

Upon observing the code, there doesn't appear to be any obvious bugs. However,
