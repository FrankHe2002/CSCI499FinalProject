The bug in the provided Java code is in this line:

```
if (arr[i - 1] <= k) {
```

The issue is that in the first iteration of the loop (`i = 0`), it is trying to access `arr[-1]`, which is outside the bounds of the array. This will result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

To fix this bug, we need to start the loop from `i = 1` instead of `i = 0`, so that we don't try to access `arr[-1]`. Additionally, we need to update the condition to `arr[i] - arr[i-1] - 1 <= k` to compare the difference between the current element and the previous element.

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr[0] > k) {
            return k;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] - arr[i-1] - 1 <= k) {
                k -= arr[i] - arr[i-1] - 1;
            } else {
                return arr[i-1] + k;
            }
        }
        return arr[arr.length - 1] + k;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we subtract `arr[i] - arr[i-1] - 1` from `k` to account for any missing numbers between `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`. If the difference is still greater than `k`, we return `arr[i-1] + k`. Otherwise, we continue the loop. If the loop finishes without returning from the `if` statement, it means `k` is still greater than the missing numbers between the last element in `arr` and the expected next number, so we return `arr[arr.length - 1] + k` as the result.
