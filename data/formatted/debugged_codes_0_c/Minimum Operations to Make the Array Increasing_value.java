Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is trying to minimize the number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal.
2. The variable `num` is used to track the current number to be matched.
3. The variable `count` is used to count the number of operations.
4. The loop starts from the second element of the array and compares it with `num` to determine the number of operations required.
5. However, there seems to be an issue with the logic, as the current implementation may not handle all scenarios correctly.

Identification of Bug:
1. Let's consider an example: nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
2. According to the current implementation, the output should be 9 as we need to increment every number by 1 to make them all equal.
3. However, the actual output is 13, which indicates a bug.
4. Let's debug the code step-by-step to identify the bug.
5. On the first iteration of the loop, `num` is currently 1 and nums[i] is 3.
6. Since num < nums[i], we assign num = nums[i] (num = 3).
7. On the second iteration, num = 3 and nums[i] = 5.
8. Since num < nums[i], we assign num = nums[i] (num = 5).
9. On the third iteration, num = 5 and nums[i] = 7.
10. Since num < nums[i], we assign num = nums[i] (num = 7).
11. On the fourth iteration, num = 7 and nums[i] = 9.
12. Since num < nums[i], we assign num = nums[i] (num = 9).
13. Now, on the fifth iteration, num = 9 and nums[i] = 9.
14. According to the current implementation, we should increment num by 1 and assign num = 10. However, the code directly increments count by 1 (count = 0 + 1 = 1).
15. The issue is that we need to increment num, as it should be the next number to match (num = 10), not count.

Bug Fix:
1. To fix the bug, we need to change the line `count++` to `num++`. This will increment the current number being matched.
2. Update the code accordingly.
