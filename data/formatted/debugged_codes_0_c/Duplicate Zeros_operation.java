The logic of the code seems correct for duplicating zeros in an array. However, there is a bug in the implementation.

The bug is in the line `arr[j % 1] = arr[j];`. The modulus operator `%` is being used with `1`, which will always result in `0`. This means that all the values in the array after index `j` will be overwritten with `0`. This is not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, the modulus operator should be used with the length of the array, not with `1`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {

    //  Time Complexity = O(n)
    //  Space Complexity = O(1)

    public void duplicateZeros(int[] arr) {

        //  Loop through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

            //  Trigger Condition
            if (arr[i] == 0) {
                int j;      // auxilliary variable for swapping 
                for (j = arr.length - 2; j >= i + 1; j--) {
                    arr[(j + 1) % arr.length] = arr[j];      //  Shift each element by one space
                }
                arr[j + 1] = 0;               //  Duplicating the zero on the consecutive index of i
                i++;                        //  Skipping the duplicated zero index in the array 
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By making this change, the code will now correctly duplicate zeros in the array.
