The code appears to have a bug in the while loop. It is supposed to reduce the value of the largest element in the PriorityQueue by half (a - a / 2) and update the 'res' variable. However, the code is subtracting a/2 from 'res' instead of subtracting a - a/2.

To fix this bug, we need to change the line 'res -= a / 2;' to 'res -= a - a / 2;'.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minStoneSum(int[] A, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        int res = 0;
        for (int a : A) {
            pq.add(a);
            res += a;
        }
        while (k-- > 0) {
            int a = pq.poll();
            pq.add(a - a / 2);
            res -= a - a / 2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
