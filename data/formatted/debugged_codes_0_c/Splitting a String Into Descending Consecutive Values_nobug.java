The bug in the provided code is an infinite recursion when `previous` is null.

Here's the reasoning process to identify the bug:

1. The code represents a recursive approach to checking if a string can be split into substrings where each substring is in a strictly decreasing order of integers.

2. The main method `splitString()` simply calls the helper method `isRemainingValid()` with the initial `previous` value set as null.

3. In the `isRemainingValid()` method, the current integer is calculated by converting a substring of the input string `s` into a long value.

4. If the current value exceeds a certain limit (10000000000L), the method returns false to avoid overflow.

5. The if-else block handles the recursive calls. If `previous` is null, it means that no previous value has been set yet, so we try to recursively check if the remaining substring starting from index `i+1` can form a valid split.

6. The bug arises when `previous` is null. The method does not handle the case where the recursion does not reach the base case and keeps calling itself with the same null `previous` value. This will result in infinite recursion and eventually a stack overflow error.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `previous` is null and introduce a base case to stop the recursion. Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean splitString(String s) {
        return isRemainingValid(s, null);
    }

    private boolean isRemainingValid(String s, Long previous) {
        long current = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            current = current * 10 + s.charAt(i) - '0';
            if (current >= 10000000000L) return false;   // Avoid overflow
            if (previous == null) {
                if (isRemainingValid(s.substring(i + 1), current))
                    return true;
            } else if (current == previous - 1 && (i == s.length() - 1 || isRemainingValid(s.substring(i + 1), current)))
                return true;
        }
        // Base case: If previous is null and we have reached the end of the string, return false
        return previous == null;
    }
}
```

The fix involves adding a return statement at the end of the method `isRemainingValid()`. If `previous` is null and we
