The bug in the provided code is a syntax error. There is an incorrect closing parenthesis in the line where the array `arr` is being populated. 

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[][] grid, int x) {
        int[] arr = new int[grid.length * grid[0].length];
        int index = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                arr[index++] = grid[i][j]; // Fixed syntax error here
            }
        }

        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int median = arr[(arr.length - 1) / 2];
        int steps = 0;

        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num == median) {
                continue;
            }

            if (Math.abs(num - median) % x != 0) {
                return -1;
            }

            steps += (Math.abs(num - median) / x);
        }

        return steps;
    }
}
```

The bug was identified by reviewing the code and noticing an incorrect closing parenthesis on the line where the array `arr` is being populated. Without the closing parenthesis, the syntax is incorrect and the code won't compile.

The bug was fixed by simply adding the correct closing parenthesis in that line.
