The bug in the provided code is in the `findNextMax` method. 

The `findNextMax` method is used to find the next maximum index in the `counter` array. It starts searching from the `from` index and goes downwards, checking if the `counter[curr]` value is greater than `0`. If it is, then `curr` is returned as the next maximum index.

The problem is that if the `from` index itself has a count greater than `0`, it is not being considered as the next maximum index. Instead, the loop continues and returns `curr = -1`, indicating that there are no more indices with a count greater than 0.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the while loop of the `findNextMax` method. Instead of checking `curr >= 0`, we should check `curr >= from`. This change ensures that if the `from` index has a count greater than 0, it is considered as the next maximum index.

Here is the modified code:

    public String repeatLimitedString(String s, int repeatLimit) {
        int[] counter = new int[26];
        int max = 0;
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            int curr = ch - 'a';
            max = Math.max(max, curr);
            counter[curr]++;
        }
        int repeated = 0;
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        while (max >= 0) {
            builder.append((char) ('a' + max));
            counter[max]--;
            repeated++;
            if (counter[max] == 0) {
                max = findNextMax(counter, max - 1);
                repeated = 0;
                continue;
            }
            if (repeated == repeatLimit) {
                // Greedy, use the next possible char once and get back to curr.
                // if no other char available, the curr word is the largest subsequence.
                int lower = findNextMax(counter, max - 1);
                if (lower < 0) {
                    return builder.toString();
                }
                builder.append((char) ('a' + lower));
                counter[lower]--;
                repeated = 0;
            }
        }
        return builder.toString();
    }
