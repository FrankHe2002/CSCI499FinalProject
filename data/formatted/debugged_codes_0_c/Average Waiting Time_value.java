The bug in the provided code is that it is not correctly calculating the waiting time for each customer.

The code first initializes the `time` variable to 0, which represents the current time. Then, for each customer, it calculates the arrival time by taking the maximum of the current time and the customer's arrival time. Then, it calculates the completion time by adding the customer's service time to the arrival time. Finally, it increments the `waitingTime` variable by the difference between the completion time and the arrival time.

However, the bug lies in the calculation of the waiting time. The correct waiting time for each customer should be the difference between the completion time and the arrival time, not the difference between the completion time and the initial arrival time.

To fix the bug, we need to store the completion time in a separate variable, calculate the waiting time correctly, and then update the current time to the completion time.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double averageWaitingTime(int[][] customers) {
        double time = 0;
        double waitingTime = 0;

        for (int[] cust : customers) {
            time = Math.max(cust[0], time);
            double completionTime = time + cust[1]; // Store the completion time in a separate variable
            waitingTime += (completionTime - cust[0]); // Calculate waiting time correctly
            time = completionTime; // Update the current time to the completion time
        }

        return waitingTime / customers.length;
    }
}
```
