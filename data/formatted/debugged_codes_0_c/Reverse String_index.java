The bug in the provided code is in the line `char temp = s[end + 2];`. 

To identify the bug, we need to understand the purpose of this line in the context of the code. The code aims to reverse the characters in the `s` array. To do so, it uses a two-pointer approach, where `start` points to the first character, and `end` points to the last character. The while loop iterates until `start` is less than `end`. 

Inside the loop, the code swaps the characters at `start` and `end` positions using a temporary variable `temp`. However, the bug occurs when defining the value of `temp`. The line `char temp = s[end + 2];` tries to access the character at the position `end + 2` in the `s` array. This is incorrect because `end + 2` is out of bounds and will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `char temp = s[end + 2];` to `char temp = s[end];`. This will correctly store the character at the `end` position in the temporary variable `temp`.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int start = 0, end = s.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            char temp = s[end];
            s[end] = s[start];
            s[start] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
