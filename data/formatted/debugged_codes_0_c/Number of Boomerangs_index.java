The bug in the provided Java code is in the calculation of the distance between two points. 

In the line `double distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(j[0] - i[0], 2) + Math.pow(j[0] - i[1], 2));`, the second part of the equation should be `(j[1] - i[1])` instead of `(j[0] - i[1])`. This is because we want to calculate the difference between the y-coordinates of the two points, not the x-coordinate and y-coordinate.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the incorrect calculation with the correct calculation.

```java
double distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(j[0] - i[0], 2) + Math.pow(j[1] - i[1], 2));
```

This will correctly calculate the distance between the two points.

Overall, the bug was identified by analyzing the code and finding the specific line where the incorrect calculation was happening. By comparing the code with the problem requirements and considering the purpose of the calculation, the correct calculation was determined and applied as the fix.
