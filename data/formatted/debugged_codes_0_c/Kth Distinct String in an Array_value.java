Bug Type: Logical Bug

Bug Explanation: The code is intended to find the k-th distinct element in the given array. However, the code has a logical bug in the second for loop. 

In the second for loop, the code iterates over the array 'arr' and checks if the count of the current element in the map is equal to 1. If the count is 1, it increments the variable 'i' and checks if 'i' is equal to 'k'. If 'i' is equal to 'k', it returns the current element 's'. However, this logic is incorrect because the map 'map' contains the count of all elements in the array, not just the distinct elements. So, the count of an element can be greater than 1 even if it is a distinct element.

For example, consider the input arr = ["a", "b", "a", "c"], k = 2. The map 'map' will have the keys "a", "b", "c" with corresponding counts 2, 1, 1. Here, the second distinct element is "b" according to the intended logic. However, the code will return "a" as the second distinct element because the count of "a" is 2.

To fix this logical bug and correctly find the k-th distinct element, we need to maintain a separate variable to keep track of the number of distinct elements found so far and compare it with 'k'.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String kthDistinct(String[] arr, int k) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String s : arr) {
            map.put(s, map.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int distinct = 0;
        for (String s : arr) {
            if (map.get(s) == 1) {
                distinct++;
            }
            if (distinct == k) {
                return s;
            }
        }
        
        return "";
    }
}
```
In the fixed code, I added a new variable 'distinct' to keep track of the number of distinct elements found so far. I incremented 'distinct' only when the count of the current element is 1. Then, I checked if 'distinct' is equal to 'k' and returned the current element if true.
