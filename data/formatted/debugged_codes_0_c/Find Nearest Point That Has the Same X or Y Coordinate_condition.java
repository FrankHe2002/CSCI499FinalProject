Based on the given code, it seems that the expected functionality is to find the index of the nearest point to the given coordinates (x, y) in the given 2D array "points". The code initializes 'min' with the maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer (Integer.MAX_VALUE) and 'index' with -1. It then iterates through each point in the array, calculating the Manhattan distance from the given coordinates (x, y) and updates 'min' and 'index' if a nearer point is found.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to be correct and no bug is found.

However, there is one unnecessary line in the code. The line "if ( min== Integer.MAX_VALUE) return -1;" is not needed because 'index' is already initialized with -1, which serves the same purpose. So, we can remove this line to simplify the code.

Here is the simplified code with the unnecessary line removed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int nearestValidPoint(int x, int y, int[][] points) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, index = - 1, i;

        for (i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (x == points[i][0] || y == points[i][1]) {
                int d = Math.abs(x - points[i][0]) + Math.abs(y - points[i][1]);
                if (d <= min) {
                    min = d;
                    index = i;
                }
            }

        }
      
        return index;

    }
}
```

The bug type is not specified as there is no bug identified in the original code.
