There is a bug in the `insertBinary` method. The condition `if (mid < k)` should be updated to `if (mid <= k)` in order to correctly traverse the tree and insert the new node in the correct position.

To fix the bug, update the condition in the `insertBinary` method as follows:

```java
if (mid <= k) {
    left = mid + 1;
    ptr = ptr.right;
}
```

By making this change, the code will correctly traverse the tree and insert the new node in the correct position.
