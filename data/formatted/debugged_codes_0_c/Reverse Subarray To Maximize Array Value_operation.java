The first step to identify and fix the bug is to carefully review the code and its logic. 

1. The `maxValueAfterReverse` method calculates the maximum possible value after reversing a subarray of the `nums` array.
2. The method starts by initializing the `result` variable to 0.
3. It then iterates through the `nums` array, calculating the absolute difference between each element and its next element using the `getAbsoluteDifference` method, and adding it to the `result` variable.
4. Next, it initializes `minLine` and `maxLine` variables to the minimum and maximum possible values, respectively.
5. It then iterates through the `nums` array again and calculates the `minLine` and `maxLine` values using the `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods.
6. It calculates the `diff` variable as the maximum of 0 and `(minLine - maxLine) * 2`.
7. The method then enters two more iterations through the `nums` array.
8. The first iteration calculates the maximum difference between the first element and each subsequent element in `nums`.
9. The second iteration calculates the maximum difference between the last element of `nums` and each previous element.
10. Finally, the method returns the sum of `result` and `diff`.

Upon reviewing the code, we can see that there is a bug in the line:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n / 1; i++)
```

The condition `n / 1` is incorrect and should be `n / 2` to properly iterate over the elements of `nums`. This bug prevents the loop from iterating over half of the elements, leading to incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to change the mentioned line to:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++)
```

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {

    private int getAbsoluteDifference(int a, int b) {
        return Math.abs(a - b);
    }

    public int maxValueAfterReverse(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
            result += getAbsoluteDifference(nums[i], nums[i + 1]);

        int minLine = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxLine = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
