The code appears to have a bug in the condition for checking if the current position (currPos) is equal to the target. The condition is written as `if (currPos != target)`, which is incorrect because it should be checking for equality (`if (currPos == target)`). This bug causes the code to return the distance when the current position is not equal to the target, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug:

1. Replace `if (currPos != target)` with `if (currPos == target)` on line 13.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 8 ms (Top 86.11%) | Memory: 41.5 MB (Top 82.95%)
class Solution {
    public int racecar(int target) {
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(new int[] {0, 1, 0});
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] item = queue.poll();
            int currPos = item[0];
            int currSpeed = item[1];
            int distance = item[2];

            if (currPos == target)
                return distance;

            // Choosing A
            int nextPos = currPos + currSpeed;
            int nextSpeed = currSpeed * 2;
            String posSpeed = new StringBuilder().append(nextPos).append(",").append(nextSpeed).toString();

            // If the particular state (position & speed) is not encountered earlier then we explore that state
            // And we also check if the nextPos is not beyond twice the size of target, then there is no point in exploring that route
            if (!visited.contains(posSpeed) && Math.abs(nextPos) < 2 * target) {
                visited.add(posSpeed);
                queue.add(new int[]{nextPos, nextSpeed, distance + 1});
            }

            // Choosing R
            // We go in reverse only when we are moving away from the target in the positive or in the negative direction
            if ((currPos + currSpeed > target && currSpeed > 0) || (currPos + currSpeed < target && currSpeed < 0)) {
                nextSpeed = currSpeed > 0 ? -1 : 1;
                posSpeed = new StringBuilder().append(currPos).append(",").append(nextSpeed).toString();

                if (!visited.contains(posSpeed) && Math.abs(currPos) < 2 * target
