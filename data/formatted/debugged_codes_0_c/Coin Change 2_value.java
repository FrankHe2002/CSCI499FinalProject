Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is attempting to implement a dynamic programming solution to the "coin change" problem, where we need to find the number of combinations of coins that can sum up to a given amount.
2. The bug in this code lies in the initialization of the `dp` array. Specifically, `dp[0] = 2;`.
3. The purpose of `dp[0]` is to represent the base case where the target amount is 0. In this case, there is only one valid solution - not using any coins. Therefore, `dp[0]` should be initialized to 1, not 2.
4. This bug will cause the code to incorrectly calculate the number of coin combinations for other amounts, as the base case is incorrect.

Fix:
Change the initialization of `dp[0]` from `dp[0] = 2;` to `dp[0] = 1;`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        // for each coin iteration : dp[i] = number of coins required to make i with coins [0...coin]
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
}
```
