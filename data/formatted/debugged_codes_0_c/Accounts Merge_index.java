Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds
Reasoning: It appears that the bug may occur when initializing the "parent" array in the UnionFind class. Currently, the size of the "parent" array is set to 1, which may lead to an IndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing indices greater than 0.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the "parent" array with the correct size (i.e. "size") in the UnionFind constructor.
```java
UnionFind(int size) {
    parent = new int[size];
    rank = new int[size];
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        parent[i] = i;
        rank[i] = 1;
    }
}
```
By replacing "parent = new int[1]" with "parent = new int[size]", we ensure that the "parent" array has the correct size and prevent the IndexOutOfBoundsException bug from occurring.
