The bug in the code is in the line `count[requests[2][0]]++;` in the `helper` method. It should be `count[requests[index][0]]++;` instead.

To identify the bug, let's understand the logic step-by-step:

1. We have an `int` variable named `max` that is initialized to 0. This variable will store the maximum number of requests.
2. In the `maximumRequests` method, we call the `helper` method with the `requests` array, a new `int` array called `count` (which will keep track of the number of requests for each building), and `num` as 0 (which will keep track of the current number of requests).
3. In the `helper` method, we have a base case when `index` becomes equal to the length of the `requests` array. This means that we have processed all the requests.
4. In the base case, we iterate over each element in the `count` array and check if any of the buildings have a count different than 0. If any building has a count different than 0, it means the buildings are not balanced, so we return without updating the `max` variable.
5. If all the buildings have a count of 0, it means the buildings are balanced. In this case, we update the `max` variable with the maximum of `max` and `num`.
6. Then, in the `helper` method, we choose a request by incrementing the count for the source building and decrementing the count for the target building.
7. After choosing the request, we make a recursive call to the `helper` method with `index + 1`, updated `count`, and `num + 1`.
8. Then, we undo the choosing of the request by decrementing the count for the source building and incrementing the count for the target building.
9. Finally, we make a recursive call to the `helper` method with `index + 1`, the same `count`, and `num` (not choosing the request).

The bug is in step 6. Instead of using `requests[2][0]` to access the source building of the request, it should be `requests[index][0]`. 

To fix the bug, we just need to replace `requests[2][0]` with `requests[index][0]`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
