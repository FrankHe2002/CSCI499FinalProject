The provided Java code appears to have a bug:

```java
curr_alt += gaini];
```

The bug is a syntax error in the code. The index `i` is missing the square brackets. It should be `gain[i]` instead of `gaini]`.

To fix the bug, we need to add the missing square brackets to access the element at index `i` in the `gain` array.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        int max_alt = 0;
        int curr_alt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gain.length; i++) {
            curr_alt += gain[i];
            max_alt = Math.max(curr_alt, max_alt);
        }
        return max_alt;
    }
}
```

The bug fix involves only a minimal change of adding square brackets to access the correct element in the `gain` array at index `i`.
