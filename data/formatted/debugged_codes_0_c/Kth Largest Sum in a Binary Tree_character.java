The provided code has a bug in the while loop. 

1. To identify the bug, let's analyze the code step by step:
2. The code initializes an empty ArrayList called "list" to store the level sums.
3. It also initializes a Queue called "qu" and adds the root node to it.
4. The while loop continues as long as the queue is not empty.
5. Inside the loop, it first calculates the size of the queue using the "qu.size()" method and stores it in variable "p".
6. It then initializes a long variable "s" to store the sum.
7. Inside the for loop, it iterates from 0 to "p" and performs the following operations:
   - If the left child of the node at the front of the queue is not null, it adds the left child to the queue.
   - If the right child of the node at the front of the queue is not null, it adds the right child to the queue.
   - It adds the value of the node at the front of the queue to the sum variable "s".
   - It removes the node from the front of the queue using the "qu.poll()" method.
8. After the for loop, it adds the sum "s" to the list.
9. Finally, it sorts the list in ascending order using the "Collections.sort()" method and returns the k-th largest element from the list.

Now, let's identify the bug:
1. The bug lies in the while loop. The code is missing the opening and closing braces for the while loop, causing a compilation error.
2. The line `int p = qu.size();` is outside the while loop, which means it will only execute once, and the value of "p" will not update inside the loop. This will cause an infinite loop because the queue will never become empty.

To fix the bug, we need to add braces to the while loop and move the line `int p = qu.size();` inside the loop to update the value of "p" in each iteration.

Here's the corrected code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public long kthLargestLevelSum(TreeNode root, int k) {
        List<Long> list = new ArrayList<>();
        Queue<TreeNode> qu = new LinkedList<>();
        qu.offer(root);
        while (!qu.isEmpty()) {
            int p = qu.size();
            long s = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < p
