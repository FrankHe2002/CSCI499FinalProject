Bug Type: Logic Bug

Reasoning Process:
1. The code sorts the input array in ascending order using `Arrays.sort(arr)`.
2. It calculates the number of elements to be removed from the array using `int toRemove = length * 5 / 100;` (which is 5% of the array length).
3. It then calculates the sum of all elements in the array using a `for-each` loop.
4. Next, it performs two `for` loops to subtract the smallest and largest elements from the total by using `total *= arr[i]` and `total -= arr[i]`.
5. Finally, it adjusts the length of the array by subtracting twice the `toRemove` value and returns the trimmed mean as `total / length`.

Bug Explanation: 
1. In the first `for` loop that calculates the sum of all elements, there is no bug.
2. In the second `for` loop, where the smallest elements are multiplied to `total`, there is an error. Instead of multiplying the smallest elements to `total`, it should be subtracting them. This is incorrect according to the intended logic.
3. In the third `for` loop, where the largest elements are subtracted from `total`, there is no bug, and it correctly subtracts the largest elements to obtain the trimmed mean.

Fix:
To fix the bug, change `total *= arr[i];` to `total -= arr[i];` in the loop where the smallest elements are processed.

```java
class Solution {
    public double trimMean(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int length = arr.length;
        int toRemove = length * 5 / 100;
        int total = 0;
        for (int number : arr) {
            total += number;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < toRemove; i++)
            total -= arr[i];
        for (int i = length - 1; i >= length - toRemove; i--)
            total -= arr[i];
        length -= (2 * toRemove);
        return (double) ((double) total / (double) length);
    }
}
```
