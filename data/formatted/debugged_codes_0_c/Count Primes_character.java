The bug in the provided code is a missing closing parenthesis in the for loop on line 6. 

To identify the bug, we can start by analyzing the code line by line:

1. The `countPrimes` method takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of prime numbers less than `n`.
2. An array `check` of booleans is initialized with size `n` to keep track of whether a number is a prime or not. By default, all elements of the array are set to `false`.
3. The variable `count` is initialized to keep count of prime numbers.
4. The for loop starts from 2 and iterates till `n-1`.
5. Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of `check[i]` is `false`.
6. If `check[i]` is `false`, it means `i` is a prime number. So, `count` is incremented.
7. Then, another for loop is started from `i` and iterates to `n` in steps of `i`.
8. Inside this nested for loop, it marks all multiples of `i` as `true` in the `check` array, indicating that they are not prime numbers.
9. Finally, the value of `count` is returned.

To fix the bug, we need to add a closing parenthesis in the for loop on line 6. The corrected code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPrimes(int n) {
        boolean check[] = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (check[i] == false) {
                count++;
                for (int j = i; j < n; j += i) {
                    check[j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

Note: This fix involves adding a closing parenthesis in line 6 after `n` in the for loop. No other changes are made to the code.
