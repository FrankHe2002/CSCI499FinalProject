Bug type: Variable Name Error

Reasoning process:
1. The first step is to analyze the code and try to identify any syntax or logic errors. 
2. Looking at the code, the variable "search" is being used before it is declared. This will result in a compilation error. 
3. The error occurs in two places: 
    - Line 9: `arr[search] == str[i]`
    - Line 14: `while(arr[search] != str[j])`
4. Based on the usage of the variable, it seems that the intention is to assign the value of `j` to `search` after line 9.
5. To fix the bug, we need to move the declaration of `search` above line 9, before it is being used.

Fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 90.26%) | Memory: 41.4 MB (Top 23.64%)
class Solution {
    public int maximumSwap(int num) {
        char str[] = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();
        char arr[] = str.clone();
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        
        int i = 0;
        int j = str.length - 1;
        int search = j; // Fix: move the declaration of search here
        
        while (i < str.length && j >= 0 && arr[search] == str[i]) {
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        
        if (i == str.length) return num;
        j = str.length - 1;
        
        while (arr[search] != str[j]) {
            j--;
        }
        
        char c = str[i];
        str[i] = str[j];
        str[j] = c;
        
        return Integer.parseInt(new String(str));
    }
}
```
