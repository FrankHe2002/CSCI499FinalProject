The provided Java code is calculating the minimum number of swaps needed to make two arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, under the condition that we can only swap corresponding elements in the two arrays. 

Upon reviewing the code, the following bug is identified:

1. The variables `p1` and `p2` are initialized with the values of the first elements of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. However, this assumes that `nums1` and `nums2` are non-empty arrays. If either array is empty, an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown when trying to access the first element.

To fix this bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the code to ensure that both arrays have at least one element. If either array is empty, we can return 0 as there are no elements to swap. Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwap(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        if (nums1.length == 0 || nums2.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int p1 = nums1[0], p2 = nums2[0], ans = 0;
        int len = nums1.length, s = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            int n1 = nums1[i], n2 = nums2[i];
            if (n1 > p1 && n2 > p2) {
                if (n1 > p2 && n2 > p2) {
                    ans += Math.min(count, i - s - count);
                    s = i;
                    count = 0;
                }
                p1 = n1;
                p2 = n2;
            } else {
                count++;
                p1 = n2;
                p2 = n1;
            }
        }
        return ans + Math.min(count, len - s - count);
    }
}
```

The bug is fixed by checking if either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty at the beginning of the code and returning 0 if either array is empty.
