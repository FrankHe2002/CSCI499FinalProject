Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
- The code is supposed to find two non-negative integers A and B such that A + B is equal to n and neither A nor B contains the digit 0.
- The code iterates through all integers from 1 to n (inclusive) and checks if A and B do not contain the digit 0.
- If such integers A and B are found, they are returned as an array with two elements (A and B).
- If no such integers are found, an empty array is returned.
- The bug occurs in the condition for determining if A and B do not contain the digit 0.
- The condition `!(A * "").contains("0") && ! (B + "").contains("0")` is used for this check.

Fix:
- The fix for this bug is to change the condition for determining if A and B do not contain the digit 0.
- The current condition `!(A * "").contains("0") && ! (B + "").contains("0")` does not correctly check if a number contains the digit 0. Multiplying a number by an empty string ("") does not result in the string representation of the number.
- To fix this, we can convert A and B to strings using the `String.valueOf()` method and then check if the strings contain the digit 0 using the `contains()` method.
- The updated condition should be `!(String.valueOf(A).contains("0")) && ! (String.valueOf(B).contains("0"))`.
- This condition will correctly check if A and B don't contain the digit 0.

Updated code with bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
        int B;
        for (int A = 1; A < n; ++ A) {
            B = n - A;
            if (! (String.valueOf(A).contains("0")) && ! (String.valueOf(B).contains("0")))
                return new int[] {A, B};
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```
