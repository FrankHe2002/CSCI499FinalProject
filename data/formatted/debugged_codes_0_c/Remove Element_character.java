This is a code snippet for the "removeElement" method to remove all instances of a given value from an array. 

Upon reviewing the code, there is a Syntax error at the for loop declaration. 

The bug type in this code is a Syntax error.

To fix this issue, the "for" loop declaration should have an opening parenthesis immediately after the "for" keyword.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int ind = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[ind++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return ind;
    }
}
```
