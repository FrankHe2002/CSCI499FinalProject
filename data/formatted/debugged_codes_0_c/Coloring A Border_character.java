The provided Java code seems to have a bug. 

Upon reviewing the code, the bug seems to be in the line `if (grid[i][j < 0) {`. The closing square bracket is missing, resulting in a syntax error. This error can be identified by a careful inspection of the code and noticing the missing closing bracket. 

To fix this bug, we need to add the closing square bracket "]" after "j", like `if (grid[i][j] < 0) {`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] colorBorder(int[][] grid, int row, int col, int color) {
        dfs(grid, row, col, grid[row][col]);
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] < 0) {
                    grid[i][j] = color;
                }
            }
        }

        return grid;
    }

    int[][] dirs = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, - 1}, {- 1, 0}};

    public void dfs(int[][] grid, int row, int col, int color) {
        grid[row][col] = - color;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int rowdash = row + dirs[i][0];
            int coldash = col + dirs[i][1];

            if (rowdash < 0 || coldash < 0 || rowdash >= grid.length || coldash >= grid[0].length ||
                    Math.abs(grid[rowdash][coldash]) != color) {
                continue;
            }
            count++;

            if (grid[rowdash][coldash] == color) {
                dfs(grid, rowdash, coldash, color);
            }

        }
        if (count == 4) {
            grid[row][col] = color;
        }

    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by adding the missing closing square bracket "]" in the line `if (grid[i][j] < 0) {`.
