Bug Type: Logic error

Reasoning Process:
To identify the bug type, I will carefully review the code and analyze its logic. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The code initializes the variable `n` as the length of the given array `nums`.
2. It initializes `currmax` as 0, and `gmax` as the first element of `nums`.
3. It then starts a loop from `i=0` to `i<n`.
4. Inside the loop, it adds the current element of `nums` to `currmax`. So, `currmax` represents the sum of elements from index 0 to the current index `i`.
5. It updates the `gmax` by taking the maximum of `gmax` and `currmax`. So, `gmax` represents the maximum sum of subarrays seen so far.
6. It updates `currmax` by taking the maximum of `currmax` and 0. This means if `currmax` becomes negative, it is set to 0.
7. Finally, it returns the value of `gmax`, which represents the maximum sum of subarrays.

After analyzing the code, I don't see any syntax errors or compilation errors. However, I suspect a logic error in the code. The bug seems to be related to handling negative numbers.

The code only updates `currmax` to 0 if it becomes negative. However, this approach fails to handle cases where all elements in the array `nums` are negative. In such cases, the code incorrectly returns 0 as the maximum sum.

Additionally, the code initializes `currmax` as 0, but it doesn't handle the scenario where all elements in `nums` are negative. In such cases, the initial value of `currmax` should be set to the first element of `nums` instead of 0.

Fix:
To fix the bug and handle negative inputs correctly, I will make the following changes:

- Initialize `currmax` as the first element of `nums` instead of 0.
- Update the loop to start from `i=1` instead of `i=0`, as the first element is already considered in the initialization of `currmax`.

Here is the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int currmax = nums[0];
        int gmax = nums[0];
