The bug in the provided code is in the condition for checking if a cell is infected or visited in the `dfs` method. 

The condition is currently written as `isInfected[i][j] != 1 || visited[i][j]`. However, this condition checks if the cell is not infected or if it is visited, which is incorrect. It should check if the cell is infected and not visited.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `isInfected[i][j] != 1 && !visited[i][j]`.

Here is the updated code:

```java
private void dfs(int i, int j, Region reg, int[][] grid, boolean[][] visited, boolean[][] uninfectedVis, int m, int n) {
    visited[i][j] = true;
    reg.addInfected(i, j);

    for (int[] dir : DIR) {
        int di = i + dir[0];
        int dj = j + dir[1];

        // continue, if out of bounds OR contained OR already visited
        if (di < 0 || dj < 0 || di == m || dj == n || grid[di][dj] == 2 || visited[di][dj])
            continue;

        // if neighbour node is not infected
        if (grid[di][dj] == 0) {
            // a wall will require to stop the spread from cell (i,j) to (di, dj)
            reg.wallsRequired++;

            // if this uninfected node is not already visited for current region
            if (! uninfectedVis[di][dj]) {
                uninfectedVis[di][dj] = true;
                reg.addUninfected(di, dj);
            }
        } else
            dfs(di, dj, reg, grid, visited, uninfectedVis, m, n);
    }
}
```
