Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning Process:
- The code is trying to calculate the minimum perimeter required to obtain the given number of apples.
- It uses a loop to increment the value of 'n' until the count of apples exceeds the given number.
- The count is incremented by the formula (12 * n * n) in each iteration.
- Finally, the minimum perimeter is calculated by multiplying 'n' by 8.
- The bug in this code is that it calculates the perimeter incorrectly, which may lead to an incorrect result.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the formula used to calculate the count of apples in each iteration of the loop.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumPerimeter(long neededApples) {
        long n = -1;
        long count = 0;
        while (count < neededApples) {
            n++;
            count += (2 * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1));
        }
        return n * 8;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The updated code uses the formula (2 * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) to calculate the count of apples in each iteration.
- The new formula accounts for the count of apples in the corners of each square as well.
- This fix ensures that the count is calculated correctly and provides the minimum perimeter required to obtain the given number of apples.
