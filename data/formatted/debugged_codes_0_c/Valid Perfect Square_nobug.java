The code appears to implement binary search to check if a given number is a perfect square. The bug in the code is that it does not correctly handle cases where the given number is a large perfect square. 

To fix the bug, we can change the condition in the while loop to `start <= end` instead of `start < end`. This will allow the algorithm to correctly handle cases where the perfect square is the largest possible integer.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long start = 1;
        long end = num;

        while (start <= end) {
            long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (mid * mid == num) {
                return true;
            } else if (mid * mid < num) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

By changing the condition in the while loop, we ensure that the algorithm checks all possible values between `start` and `end`, including the case where `start` and `end` are equal (i.e., the perfect square is the largest possible integer).
