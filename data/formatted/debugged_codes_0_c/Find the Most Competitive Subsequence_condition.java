The bug in the provided code is the condition in the while loop, which should be `j >= 1` instead of `j <= 0`.

To identify this bug, we can analyze the logic of the code step by step:

1. Create a stack array to store the most competitive elements.
2. Iterate over the `nums` array from index 0 to the end.
3. Inside the loop, compare the current element of `nums` with the previous element in the stack (`stack[j - 1]`) and the remaining number of elements from `nums` that can be added to the stack (`j + nums.length - i > k`).
4. While the conditions in the while loop are satisfied, decrement `j`, moving back in the stack.
5. After exiting the while loop, if `j` is less than `k`, it means there is space in the stack to add the current element from `nums`, so increment `j` and add the element to the stack.

The bug occurs in the while loop condition: `j <= 0` should be `j >= 1`. 

The corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] mostCompetitive(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] stack = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            while (j >= 1 && stack[j - 1] > nums[i] && j + nums.length - i > k) {
                j--;
            }
            if (j < k) {
                stack[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return stack;
    }
}
```
