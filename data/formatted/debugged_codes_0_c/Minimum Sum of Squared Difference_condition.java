The code calculates the minimum sum of squared differences between two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. It compares each element in the arrays and calculates the absolute difference. It stores the differences in an array `diffs` and counts the number of occurrences of each difference. 

The bug in the code is in the final for loop that calculates the `minSumSquare`. The condition `i > maxDiff` is incorrect. It should be `i <= maxDiff` to loop through all the differences in the `diffs` array. 

To fix the bug, change the condition in the final for loop from `i > maxDiff` to `i <= maxDiff`:
```java
for (int i = 0; i <= maxDiff; i++) {
    if (diffs[i] > 0) {
        minSumSquare += (long) (Math.pow((long) i, 2)) * diffs[i];
    }
}
```

This will correctly calculate the `minSumSquare` by looping through all the differences and multiplying each difference by its square.
