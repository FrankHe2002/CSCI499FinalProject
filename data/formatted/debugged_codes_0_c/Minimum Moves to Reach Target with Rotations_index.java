The bug in the provided code is related to the condition check for positions where `r1` is equal to `r2` and `grid[r1 + 1][c1]` and `grid[r2 + 1][c2]` are both equal to 0. The code mistakenly checks `grid[r1 + 1][c1]` twice instead of checking `grid[r1 + 1][c2]` for `r2`. This can result in incorrect results or an infinite loop.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checks in the following lines:
```java
if (r1 == r2 && r1 + 1 < n && r2 + 1 < n && grid[r1 + 1][c1] == 0 && grid[r2 + 1][c2] == 0 && grid[r1 + 1][c1] == 0)
    nextq.offer(new Position(r1, c1, r1 + 1, c1));
if (c1 == c2 && c1 + 1 < n && c2 + 1 < n && grid[r1][c1 + 1] == 0 && grid[r2][c1 + 1] == 0 && grid[r1][c1 + 1] == 0)
    nextq.offer(new Position(r1, c1, r1, c1 + 1));
```

We should update them as follows:
```java
if (r1 == r2 && r1 + 1 < n && r2 + 1 < n && grid[r1 + 1][c1] == 0 && grid[r1 + 1][c2] == 0)
    nextq.offer(new Position(r1, c1, r1 + 1, c1));
if (c1 == c2 && c1 + 1 < n && c2 + 1 < n && grid[r1][c1 + 1] == 0 && grid[r1][c1 + 1] == 0)
    nextq.offer(new Position(r1, c1, r1, c1 + 1));
```
