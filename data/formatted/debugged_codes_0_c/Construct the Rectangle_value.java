There is a bug in the given Java code. In the inner if statement, instead of assigning the value of `w` to `result[0]`, it is assigned to `result[1]`. This results in incorrect values being stored in the `result` array, causing incorrect output.

To fix this bug, the assignment statement should be changed to `result[0] = w;` instead of `result[1] = w;`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] result = new int[2];

        for (int w = 1; w * w <= area; w++) {
            if (area % w == 0) {
                int l = area / w;
                int diff = l - w;
                if (diff < minDiff) {
                    result[0] = w;
                    result[1] = l;
                    minDiff = diff;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

By changing the assignment statement, the bug is fixed and the correct values for the width and length are stored in the `result` array.
