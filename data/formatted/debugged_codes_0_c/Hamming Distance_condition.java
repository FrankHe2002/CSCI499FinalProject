Bug type: Infinite loop

Reasoning process:

1. The code starts by calculating the XOR of `x` and `y` and storing it in the variable `ans`.
2. Then, it initializes the variable `count` to 0. This variable will be used to store the number of set bits (1s) in `ans`.
3. The code enters a while loop with the condition `ans <= 0`. The intention of this loop is to count the number of set bits in `ans` by performing a bitwise AND operation (`ans & 1`) with the least significant bit and incrementing `count` if the result is 1. Then, `ans` is right-shifted by 1 bit.
4. However, there is a bug in the while loop condition. It should be `ans > 0` instead of `ans <= 0`. The current condition will cause an infinite loop if `ans` is negative or zero because it will always satisfy the condition.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int ans = x ^ y;
        int count = 0;
        while (ans > 0) { // Fix: Change condition to ans > 0
            count += ans & 1;
            ans >>= 1;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
