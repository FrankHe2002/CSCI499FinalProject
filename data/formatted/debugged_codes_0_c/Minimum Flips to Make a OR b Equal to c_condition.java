There is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the while loop condition:

```java
while (c == 0 || x != 0)
```

The intention of this condition is to continue the loop as long as either c is not equal to 0 or x is not equal to 0. However, due to the incorrect logical operator used (`||` instead of `&&`), the loop will continue if either c is 0 or x is not 0. This means that the loop will prematurely exit if c is 0 and x still has remaining bits to be checked.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `||` with `&&` in the while loop condition:

```java
while (c != 0 && x != 0)
```

This will ensure that the loop continues as long as both c is not 0 and x is not 0.

Updated code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 39.2 MB (Top 89.45%)
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
        int j = - 1;
        int x = a | b;
        int count = 0;
        while (c != 0 && x != 0) {
            j++;
            int aa = x % 2;
            int bb = c % 2;
            if (aa == 0 && bb == 1) count++;
            else if (aa == 1 && bb == 0) count += funcount(j, a, b);
            x = x >> 1;
            c = c >> 1;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static int funcount(int shift, int a, int b) {
        int cc = 0;
        int mask = 1 << shift;
        int b1 = a & mask;
        int b2 = b & mask;
        if (b1 != 0) cc++;
        if (b2 != 0) cc++;
        return cc;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by changing the conditional operator in the while loop to `&&` instead of `||`.
