Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
- The code calculates the maximum sum of the subarrays, but the current implementation has a logical error in step 2.
- In step 2, the code uses a monotonic decreasing stack to find the left and right boundaries of each subarray.
- However, the implementation of getting the left boundary is incorrect.
- The code sets the left boundary (l) to 0 if the stack is not empty, which means it assumes there is always an element in the stack.
- However, this is not correct since there might not be any elements in the stack.

Fix:
To fix the bug and correctly calculate the left boundary (l), we need to check if the stack is empty before setting l. If the stack is empty, it means there are no elements to the left, so the left boundary should be 0. Otherwise, we should use s[top] + 1 to get the left boundary.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSumMinProduct(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length, M = 1_000_000_007;
        long res = 0L;

        //step 1: get prefix sum
        long[] psum = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) psum[i + 1] = psum[i] + a[i];

        //step 2: get the left and right bound of each sub-array using monotonic decreasing & increasing stack
        int[] s = new int[n];
        int top = -1; // monotonic-decreasing stack for right bound
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; s[++top] = i++) {
            while (top >= 0 && (i == n || a[i] < a[s[top]])) {
                int min = a[s[top--]]; // get curMin value and poll current index out of stack, its left and right boundary is not determined
                int l = top != -1 ? s[top] + 1 : 0; // use the prev idx to get left bound, inclusive
                int r = i - 1; // right bound, inclusive
                res = Math.max(res, min * (psum[r + 1] - psum[l]));
            }
        }

        return (int) (res % M);
    }
}
```
