Upon reviewing the code, it seems that there may not be any major bugs. However, we can observe that the method `isConsistent` is currently defined as a package-private method, meaning it can only be accessed within the same package. Since the method is used inside the `Solution` class, it would be more appropriate to declare it as a private method. This will encapsulate the functionality and ensure that it is only accessible within the `Solution` class.

To fix this, we can modify the `isConsistent` method to be private as follows:

```java
private boolean isConsistent(Set<Character> allowedSet, String word) {
    for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
        if (! allowedSet.contains(word.charAt(i))) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

Note that we only made a single change, updating the access modifier from `boolean` to `private`.

With this fix, the code will still perform the same logic but the `isConsistent` method will no longer be accessible outside the `Solution` class.
