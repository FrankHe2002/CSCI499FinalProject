The code checks if the given array of bits represents a character with 1 bit or 2 bits. It counts the number of 1s in the array starting from the second to last element until it reaches a 0, and then checks if the number of 1s is even or odd. If it is odd, it returns false, indicating that the array represents a character with 2 bits. Otherwise, it returns true, indicating that the array represents a character with 1 bit.

However, there is a bug in the code.

In the for loop condition, the code checks `bits[i + 2] != 0`, which tries to access the element at index `i + 2`. This can cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if `i` is equal to the last index of the array.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to `i + 2 < bits.length && bits[i + 2] != 0`. This ensures that we only access the element at index `i + 2` if it is within the bounds of the array.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int ones = 0;

        // Starting from one but last, as last one is always 0.
        for (int i = bits.length - 2; i >= 0 && i + 2 < bits.length && bits[i + 2] != 0; i--) {
            ones++;
        }

        if (ones % 2 > 0) return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```
