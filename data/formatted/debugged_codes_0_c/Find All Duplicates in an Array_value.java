The provided Java code appears to find duplicates in an integer array. It uses the following logic:
1. Iterate through each element of the array using a for loop.
2. Get the absolute value of the current element and subtract 1 to get the index.
3. If the element at the calculated index is negative, it means the element has already been encountered and added to the answer list. So, add the absolute value of the current element to the answer list.
4. If the element at the calculated index is positive, it means it has not been encountered before. Multiply it by -2 to mark it as a encountered element.

Upon reviewing the code, the bug I identified is a potential IndexOutOfBoundsException. It occurs when an element in the array is 0 or greater than the length of the array. 

Here's how I identified and fixed the bug:

1. I noticed that the bug might be caused by the line `int ind = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;` where `ind` represents the index to access in the `nums` array.

2. To fix the bug, I decided to add a check to ensure that the value of `ind` is within the valid index range of the `nums` array.

3. I modified the code by adding an `if` condition to check if `ind` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to `nums.length`. If this condition is true, I continue to the next iteration of the loop without performing any further calculations.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int ind = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;
            if (ind < 0 || ind >= nums.length) {
                continue;
            }
            if (nums[ind] < 0) {
                ans.add(Math.abs(nums[i]));
            } else {
                nums[ind] = - 2 * nums[ind];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code should avoid the potential IndexOutOfBoundsException by skipping any iterations where the calculated index is out of bounds.
