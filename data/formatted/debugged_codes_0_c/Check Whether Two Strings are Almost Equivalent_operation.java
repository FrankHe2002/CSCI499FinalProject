There is a type error in the code. The condition in the second for loop is incorrect. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition `i < * 3` to `i < -3` in the second for loop. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public boolean checkAlmostEquivalent(String word1, String word2) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        for (int i = 0; i < word1.length(); i++) {
            map.put(word1.charAt(i), map.getOrDefault(word1.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
            map.put(word2.charAt(i), map.getOrDefault(word2.charAt(i), 0) - 1);
        }
        for (int i : map.values()) { //get value set
            if (i > 3 || i < -3) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

The bug was identified by recognizing the incorrect condition `i < * 3` in the second for loop. By reading the code and understanding its purpose, it is clear that the intent is to check if any value in the map is greater than 3 or less than -3, therefore the correct condition should be `i < -3`.
