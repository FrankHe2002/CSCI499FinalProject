Bug type: Syntax error

Explanation:

1. In the line `public int maximumGood(int[][ statements) {`, there is a syntax error. The opening square bracket "[" is not placed properly.
2. To fix the error, the opening square bracket should be placed after the data type `int[][]`.

Fix:

```java
public int maximumGood(int[][] statements) {
```
