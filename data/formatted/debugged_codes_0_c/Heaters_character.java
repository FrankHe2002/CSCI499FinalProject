Bug type: Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning process:
1. The code tries to find the minimum radius such that all houses are covered by heaters. It does this by performing a binary search on the possible radius values.
2. The `can()` method is called to check if a given radius is valid. It iterates through each heater and checks if there exists a house within the range of the current heater.
3. The bug is in the line `int to = heatersi] + r;`. It should be `int to = heaters[i] + r;`, as `heaters[i]` is the correct syntax for accessing an element in the array, not `heatersi]`.
4. This bug causes an Index Out of Bounds Exception because `heatersi]` is not a valid index in the array `heaters`.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean can(int r, int[] houses, int[] heaters) {
        int prevHouseIdx = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < heaters.length; i++) {
            int from = heaters[i] - r;
            int to = heaters[i] + r;
            for (int j = prevHouseIdx + 1; j < houses.length; j++) {
                if (houses[j] <= to && houses[j] >= from) {
                    prevHouseIdx++;
                } else break;
            }
            if (prevHouseIdx >= houses.length - 1) return true;
        }
        return prevHouseIdx >= houses.length - 1;
    }

    public int findRadius(int[] houses, int[] heaters) {
        Arrays.sort(houses);
        Arrays.sort(heaters);
        int lo = 0, hi = 1000000004;
        int mid, ans = hi;
        while (lo <= hi) {
            mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if (can(mid, houses, heaters)) {
                ans = mid;
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else lo = mid + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
