Bug: The bug in the provided Java code is in the line where the count is calculated. 

The bug type is an integer division bug. 

Reasoning process:
1. The code calculates the value of `count` by dividing the length of the input array `arr` by 8.
2. The division is done using the `/` operator.
3. The division operator `/` performs integer division when both operands are integers, resulting in the quotient being truncated to an integer.
4. The length of `arr` is an integer and 8 is also an integer.
5. Therefore, when the length of `arr` is less than 8, the division will result in 0, which is not the desired behavior.

Fix: To fix the bug, we need to change the division operator from `/` to `/`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findSpecialInteger(int[] arr) {
        if (arr.length == 1) {
            return arr[0];
        }
        int count = (int) Math.ceil(arr.length / 8.0); // fixed the bug by changing 8 to 8.0

        System.out.println(count);

        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (Integer i : arr) {
            map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
            if (map.get(i) > count) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return - 1;
    }
}
```

Explanation: By changing `8` to `8.0`, we ensure that the division is performed as floating-point division instead of integer division. This ensures that the result is not truncated and provides the desired value for `count` even when the length of `arr` is less than 8.
