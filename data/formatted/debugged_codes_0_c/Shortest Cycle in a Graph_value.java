The code appears to implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the shortest cycle in an undirected graph. The bug in the code appears to be in the condition for checking whether to visit an adjacent node.

In the following line of code:

```java
if (it != par && (!hmap.containsKey(it) || hmap.get(it)[0] > dist + 1 || hmap.get(it)[1] == 1))
```

The condition checks whether the adjacent node `it` is not the parent node `par`, and whether one of the following conditions is satisfied:
1. The adjacent node does not exist in `hmap`.
2. The distance to the adjacent node is greater than `dist + 1`.
3. The adjacent node is part of the current DFS call, as indicated by the status value of 1 in `hmap.get(it)[1]`.

However, there is a bug in this condition. The third condition should actually check whether the adjacent node is part of a previous DFS call, indicated by the status value of 0 in `hmap.get(it)[1]`. This is because if the adjacent node is part of the current DFS call, visiting it would create a cycle.

To fix the bug, the third condition should be changed as follows:

```java
if (it != par && (!hmap.containsKey(it) || hmap.get(it)[0] > dist + 1 || hmap.get(it)[1] == 0))
```

By making this change, the code will correctly check whether the adjacent node is part of a previous DFS call and avoid visiting it if it would lead to a cycle.
