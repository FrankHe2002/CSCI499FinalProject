Bug type: IndexOutofBoundsException

Reasoning:
1. The code is supposed to generate Pascal's Triangle and return the rowIndex-th row.
2. The code initializes a List of Lists, `out`, to store the triangle.
3. It then iterates `rowIndex` number of times to generate each row and adds it to `out`.
4. In each iteration, a new `in` List is created to store the values of the current row.
5. The inner loop iterates `i + 1` times to calculate each value of the row.
6. In the inner loop, if `j` is either 0 or `i`, 1 is added to `in`.
7. Otherwise, the value is calculated by adding the corresponding values from the previous row (`out.get(i - 1).get(j - 1) + out.get(i - 1).get(j)`) and added to `in`.
8. Finally, the `in` List is added to `out`.
9. At the end of the loop, the method returns the `rowIndex`-th row of `out`.

The bug in the code is related to the initialization of the `out` List. It is initialized as an empty ArrayList, and in each iteration, a new row is added to it. However, the code tries to access the `rowIndex`-th row using `out.get(rowIndex)`, which will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException because the index of the last row is `rowIndex - 1`, not `rowIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the outer loop from `i < rowIndex` to `i <= rowIndex`. This will ensure that `rowIndex` number of rows are generated and stored in `out`. Lastly, we need to return the last row of `out` using `out.get(rowIndex - 1)`.

Here is the fixed code:

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        List<List<Integer>> out = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
            List<Integer> in = new ArrayList<>(i + 1);
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (j == 0 || j == i) {
                    in.add(
