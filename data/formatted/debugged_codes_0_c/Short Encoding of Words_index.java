Bugs in the code:

1. The line `return children[ms];` in the `getChild()` method should access the `index` instead of `ms`. This is a typographical error.

To fix the bug, update the `getChild()` method to correctly access the `index`:

```java
public Node getChild(int index) {
    return children[index];
}
```

That's the only bug in the provided code.
