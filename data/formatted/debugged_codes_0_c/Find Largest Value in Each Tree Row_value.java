Bug type: None

Reasoning:
1. The code defines a class `Solution` with a method `largestValues` that takes a `TreeNode` object as input and returns a list of integers.
2. The code checks if the root node is null. If it is, it returns an empty list, indicating that there are no values in the tree.
3. It then initializes a queue `q` and adds the root node to it.
4. The code enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty.
5. Inside the while loop, it initializes a variable `size` with the size of the queue.
6. It also initializes a variable `res` with the minimum integer value.
7. Then, it enters another while loop that runs `size` number of times.
8. Inside the inner while loop, it removes the first node from the queue using `q.poll()` and stores it in the variable `temp`.
9. If the `temp` node has a left child, it adds the left child to the queue.
10. If the `temp` node has a right child, it adds the right child to the queue.
11. It compares the value of `temp` with the current maximum value `res` and updates `res` with the larger value.
12. After the inner while loop finishes, it adds the maximum value `res` to the list `li`.
13. The outer while loop repeats until all nodes in the tree have been processed.
14. Finally, it returns the list `li` containing the maximum values at each level of the tree.

There doesn't seem to be any bug in the code. The code correctly finds the maximum value at each level of the binary tree using a level-order traversal.

Fix:

There is no bug in the provided code, so no fix is needed.
