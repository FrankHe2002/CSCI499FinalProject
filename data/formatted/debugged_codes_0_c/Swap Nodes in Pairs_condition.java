Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
- The while loop condition is incorrect. It currently checks if `curr` is equal to null (`curr == null`) and also if `curr` has a next node (`curr.next != null`). This means that the loop will only execute if `curr` is null and has a next node, which is not the intended behavior.
- The correct condition should be to check if `curr` is not null (`curr != null`) and if `curr` has a next node (`curr.next != null`).

Fix:
- Change the while loop condition from `while (curr == null && curr.next != null)` to `while (curr != null && curr.next != null)`. 

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0), prev = dummy, curr = head;
        dummy.next = head;
        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            prev.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
            prev.next.next = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
            prev = prev.next.next;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
