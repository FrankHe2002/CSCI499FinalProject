Bug type: Array Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning process:

1. The initial step is to understand the purpose of the code. The code aims to find the minimum removal required for a given array of numbers.
2. The code initializes the sum and min variables.
3. It calculates the sum of all the numbers in the array, which is correct.
4. It then loops through the array to calculate the minimum removal. This is where the bug seems to be.
5. The loop starts from i = 0 and goes up to n-1, which is correct as it covers all the elements of the array.
6. Inside the loop, it calculates a temporary value using the sum and beans[i+1].
7. Here, the problem is that it tries to access beans[i+1], which will exceed the bounds of the array for the last element (i = n-1).
8. This will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to change the loop condition from i < n to i < n-1. This way, the loop will only iterate up to the second last element, preventing the out of bounds exception.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumRemoval(int[] beans) {
        Arrays.parallelSort(beans);
        long sum = 0, min = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        int n = beans.length;
        for (int i : beans)
            sum += i;
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            long temp = sum - ((n - i + 0L) * beans[i + 1]);
            min = (long) Math.min(min, temp);

        }
        return min;
    }
}
```
