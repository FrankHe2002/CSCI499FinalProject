Bug Type: Array Indexing Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code tries to extract each digit from the given number by iterating through it.
2. It stores each digit in an array named `dig`.
3. The code then sorts the `dig` array in ascending order.
4. Finally, it combines the first and fourth digits of `dig` to form `num1`, and the second and third digits to form `num2`.
5. The sum of `num1` and `num2` is returned.

In the provided buggy code, there are two bugs:

1. The line `int num1 = dig[0] * 10 + dig[3];` should be changed to `int num1 = dig[0] * 10 + dig[2];`. This is because the fourth digit is stored at index 2 in the `dig` array, not at index 3.
2. The line `int num2 = dig[1] * 10 + dig[2];` should be changed to `int num2 = dig[1] * 10 + dig[3];`. This is because the third digit is stored at index 3 in the `dig` array, not at index 2.

Additionally, the code should import the `Arrays` class from the `java.util` package to use the `sort()` method.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumSum(int num) {
        int[] dig = new int[4]; // For each digit
        int cur = 0;
        while (num > 0) // Getting each digit
        {
            dig[cur++] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        Arrays.sort(dig); // Ascending order
        int num1 = dig[0] * 10 + dig[2]; // 1st and 4th digit
        int num2 = dig[1] * 10 + dig[3]; // 2nd and 3rd digit
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```
