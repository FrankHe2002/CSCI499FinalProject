Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
1. The code calculates the maximum sum of two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` using two pointers `i` and `j`.
2. The code compares elements at indices `i` and `j` in both arrays.
3. If the elements are equal, it adds the maximum sum of `sum1` and `sum2` to `currSum` and resets `sum1` and `sum2` to 0.
4. If the element at `nums1[i]` is less than the element at `nums2[j]`, it adds `nums1[i]` to `sum1` and increments `i`.
5. If the element at `nums1[i]` is greater than the element at `nums2[j]`, it adds `nums2[j]` to `sum2` and increments `j`.
6. After the while loop, the code adds the remaining elements from `nums1[i]` to `sum1` and from `nums2[j]` to `sum2`.
7. Finally, it returns the sum of `currSum` and the maximum value between `sum1` and `sum2`.

The bug in the code is that when comparing elements at `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`, it only includes the case for `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` in the if statement. It fails to consider the case when `nums1[i]` is greater than `nums2[j]`. This means that the code is not correctly calculating the maximum sum.

To fix the bug, we need to add an additional else statement to handle the case when `nums1[i]` is greater than `nums2[j]`. In this case, we should add `nums1[i]` to `sum1` and increment `i`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSum(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        long currSum = 0, sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length) {
            if (nums1[i] == nums2[j]) {
                currSum += Math.max(sum1, sum2) + nums2[j];
                sum1 = 0;
                sum2 = 0;
                i++;
                j
