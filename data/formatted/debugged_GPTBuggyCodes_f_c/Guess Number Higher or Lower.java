Bug Type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning: 

In the given code, the binary search algorithm is used to guess the number. The algorithm sets the `left` and `right` bounds for the search range. However, there is a subtle bug in the code where `left` is set to `mid` instead of `mid + 1` when the guessed number is larger than the target.

This bug causes an off-by-one error, resulting in an infinite loop if the target number is not found within the search range. It happens because the search range is not correctly adjusted, and the same `mid` value is repeatedly guessed.

To fix this bug, the assignment statement `left = mid;` should be changed to `left = mid + 1;` to ensure the correct adjustment of the search range.

Fixed Code:

```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = ((right - left) / 2) + left;
            if (guess(mid) == 0)
                return mid;
            else if (guess(mid) < 0)
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                left = mid + 1; // Fix: Adjust the left bound correctly
        }

        return left;
    }
}
```
