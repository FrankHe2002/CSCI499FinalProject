The bug in the provided code is that it uses the `remove()` method of the `Stack` class instead of the `pop()` method when removing elements from the stack. The `remove()` method is used for removing an object from a collection, while the `pop()` method is used to remove the top element from a stack.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to use the `pop()` method instead of the `remove()` method. This will correctly remove the top element from the stack.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 95 ms (Top 46.58%) | Memory: 54.8 MB (Top 52.34%)
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s) {
        Stack<Character> st = new Stack<>();
        int i = s.length() - 1;
        while (i >= 0) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (!st.isEmpty() && ch == st.peek()) { // Fixed bug: Changed st.size() > 0 to !st.isEmpty()
                st.pop(); // Fixed bug: Changed remove() to pop()
            } else {
                st.push(ch);
            }
            i--;
        }
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder("");
        while (!st.isEmpty()) {
            ans.append(st.pop());
        }
        return ans.toString();
    }
}
```

Note: The code could be further optimized by directly appending characters to the StringBuilder during the loop instead of using a stack and then reversing the StringBuilder at the end. However, since the question specifically mentioned not to optimize the code, the minimal change fix has been applied without reorganizing or optimizing the code.
