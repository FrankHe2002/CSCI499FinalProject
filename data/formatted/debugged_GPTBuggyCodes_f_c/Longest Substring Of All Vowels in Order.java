Bug Type: Iteration Variable Error

Reasoning: The provided code has a bug in the loop condition `i < word.length()`. This condition causes the loop to terminate prematurely, resulting in the code not correctly counting the length of beautiful substrings in the word. The bug occurs because the loop variable `i` is incremented twice within the loop (once in the `while` loop and once in the `for` loop).

Fix: To fix the bug, we need to change the loop variable in the `while` loop from `i` to a new variable (e.g., `j`). This way, we can ensure that the outer `for` loop's iteration is not affected by the inner `while` loop. Additionally, we need to adjust the loop condition in the `for` loop to `i <= word.length()` so that the last character of the word is also considered. Finally, we need to change the update statement in the `for` loop to `i = j` so that we resume iteration from the correct position.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestBeautifulSubstring(String word) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= word.length(); i++) {
            int temp = 1;
            Set<Character> verify = new HashSet<>();
            verify.add(word.charAt(i - 1));
            int j = i;
            while (j < word.length() && word.charAt(j) >= word.charAt(j - 1)) {
                temp++;
                verify.add(word.charAt(j));
                j++;
            }
            max = verify.size() == 5 ? Math.max(max, temp) : max;
            i = j;
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
