Bug Type: Logic Error

Bug Explanation: The logic used to calculate the current number of passengers is incorrect. The code updates `currPassengers` by adding the value of `passengers`, which represents the change in the number of passengers at each destination. However, the code needs to calculate the cumulative number of passengers by adding the change in passengers to the previous total at each step.

Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, the code should update `currPassengers` by adding the change in passengers to the previous total at each step. This can be done by changing the line `currPassengers += passengers;` to `currPassengers = currPassengers + passengers;`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 10 ms (Top 30.51%) | Memory: 45.4 MB (Top 20.46%)
class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> destinationToPassengers = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int[] trip : trips) {
            int currPassengersAtPickup = destinationToPassengers.getOrDefault(trip[1], 0);
            int currPassengersAtDrop = destinationToPassengers.getOrDefault(trip[2], 0);
            destinationToPassengers.put(trip[1], currPassengersAtPickup + trip[0]);
            destinationToPassengers.put(trip[2], currPassengersAtDrop - trip[0]);
        }

        int currPassengers = 0;
        for (int passengers : destinationToPassengers.values()) {
            currPassengers = currPassengers + passengers;

            if (currPassengers >= capacity) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
