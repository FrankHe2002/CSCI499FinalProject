Bug type: IndexOutOfBoundsError

Reasoning:
1. The code is using a 2D `dp` array to store the maximum moves at each position.
2. In the `maxMoves` method, the condition `if (y == n - 1)` is used to check if we have reached the last column. If true, it returns 0 because there are no more moves possible.
3. However, the `dp` array is declared as `dp = new int[m][n]`, where `m` and `n` represent the dimensions of the grid.
4. Since `dp` is indexed using the variables `x` and `y`, the indices can range from 0 to `m-1` and 0 to `n-1` respectively.
5. In the line `if (dp[x][y] != - 1)`, it checks if the `dp` array has been initialized at position `(x, y)`.
6. But since `dp` is initialized as `dp = new int[m][n]`, the range of valid indices for `dp` will be from 0 to `m-1` and 0 to `n-1`.
7. Therefore, when `y == n-1`, the code tries to access `dp[x][y]`, where `y` is equal to `n-1`. But since the valid index range for `dp` is up to `n-1`, accessing `dp[x][y]` will result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

To fix the bug:
Update the `dp` array initialization to `dp = new int[m][n+1]` to ensure that the `dp` array has enough size to store the values up to the last column (`n`). This way, `dp[x][n]` will be the base case for the recursion in the `maxMoves` method.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 6 ms (Top 75.1%) | Memory: 54.31 MB (Top 70.0%)

class Solution {
    int[][] dp;
    int[] dirs = new int[] {- 1, 0, 1};
    int m, n, max = 0;

    private int maxMoves(int[][] grid, int x, int y) {
        if (y == n - 1) return 0;

        if (dp[x][y] != - 1) return dp[x][y
