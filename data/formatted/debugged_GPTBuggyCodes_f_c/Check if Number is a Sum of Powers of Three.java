The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition `i <= maxPower` in the second for loop. Since array indices start from 0 in Java, the loop should iterate until `i < maxPower` to avoid accessing an index out of bounds. 

Additionally, the loop should start from `i = maxPower - 1` instead of `i = maxPower` to ensure that `n` is subtracted with the highest power of 3 first.

Lastly, the variable `maxPower` should be calculated as `int maxPower = (int) (Math.log(n) / Math.log(3)) + 1` instead of `int maxPower = (int) (Math.log(n) / Math.log(3))` to account for the power of 3 equal to 1.

To fix the code, the following changes should be made:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        //max power of 3
        int maxPower = (int) (Math.log(n) / Math.log(3)) + 1;

        //save all the power of 3 from 0 to maxPower
        // 3^0, 3^1, 3^2 .... 3^maxPower
        int[] threePower = new int[maxPower];
        threePower[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < maxPower; i++) {
            threePower[i] = threePower[i - 1] * 3;
        }

        // Intuition
        // if we subtract n with every power of 3
        // at the end if n is zero, then it is sum of power 3

        // subtract n with power of 3,
        // if n is greater than power
        for (int i = maxPower - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // n is greater/equal to power of 3
            if (n >= threePower[i]) {
                n -= threePower[i];
            }
        }

        return n == 0;
    }
}
```
