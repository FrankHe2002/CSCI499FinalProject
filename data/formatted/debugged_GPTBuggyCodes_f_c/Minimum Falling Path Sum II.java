Bug Type: Infinite Recursion

Reasoning: In the provided code, there is a recursive helper method that is called within the `minFallingPathSum` method. The recursive helper method is called with arguments `i+1` and `k`, incrementing the `i` value, which is used as the index for accessing `grid` array. However, the terminating condition for the recursion is checking if `i == n-1`, meaning that when `i` reaches `n-1`, the recursion is supposed to stop. But in the provided code, there is no check to prevent `i` from going beyond `n-1`. As a result, the recursive function never terminates, leading to infinite recursion and eventually causing a `StackOverflowError`.

Fix: The fix involves modifying the terminating condition in the `helper` method. Instead of checking if `i == n-1`, we need to check if `i == n`. This will prevent the recursion from going beyond the bounds of the `grid` array and ensure proper termination.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minFallingPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (n == 1) return grid[0][0];
        int ans = 10000000;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans = Math.min(ans, grid[0][i] + helper(grid, n, 1, i));
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    private int helper(int[][] grid, int n, int i, int last) {
        if (i == n) {
            int min = 100;
            for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                if(k != last) {
                    min = Math.min(grid[n - 1][k], min);
                }
            }
            return min;
        }
        
        int min = 100000000;
        for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            if(k != last) {
                min = Math.min(min, grid[i][k] + helper(grid, n, i + 1, k));
            }
        }
        
        return min;
    }
}
```
