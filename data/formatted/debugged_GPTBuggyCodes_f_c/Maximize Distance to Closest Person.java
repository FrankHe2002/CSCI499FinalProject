Bug Type: Syntax error, Logic error, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning:

1. The code initializes the variable `start` to -1 and uses it to keep track of the index of the last occupied seat. `end` is initialized to -1 and updated to the current index whenever an occupied seat is encountered. `max` is used to store the maximum distance between occupied seats.

2. The loop iterates through the `seats` array and updates the values of `start`, `end`, and `max` based on the conditions.

3. At the end of the loop, the code checks if the last seat is empty. If it is, the distance from the last occupied seat to the end is calculated and compared to the current `max` value. The larger value is returned.

4. The code has a logic error in the line `else max = Math.max((end - start) / 2, max);`. It incorrectly calculates the distance between the last and next occupied seats. It should calculate `(end - start) / 2 + 1` to include the seat itself.

5. Additionally, the loop condition `i < size` should be `i < size - 1` to avoid accessing an index out of bounds.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
        int size = seats.length;
        int max = 0;
        int start = -1;
        int end = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {
            if (seats[i] != 0) {
                start = end;
                end = i;
                if (start == -1) max = i;
                else max = Math.max((end - start) / 2 + 1, max);
            }
            if (i == size - 2 && end == size - 1 && seats[i + 1] != 1) {
                end++;
            }
        }

        if (seats[size - 1] == 0 || start == -1) return Math.max(max, (size - 1 - end));
        return max;
    }
}
```
