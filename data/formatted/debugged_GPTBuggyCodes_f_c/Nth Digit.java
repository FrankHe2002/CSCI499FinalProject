Bug Type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning:

1. The code implements a solution to find the Nth digit in a sequence of numbers.
2. The bug occurs when determining the value of "nthDigit" in the condition `if (currDigitIndex == n)`.
3. In this condition, the code is mistakenly looping through the numbers again to find the correct "nthDigit" value.
4. However, it is already known that "currDigitIndex" has reached "n" in the previous loop.
5. The code should update the value of "nthDigit" without re-looping through the numbers.
6. The incorrect looping logic is also present in the condition `else if (currDigitIndex > n)`.
7. It unnecessarily decrements "currNumber" and re-loops to find the correct "nthDigit".
8. The fix is to update the value of "nthDigit" within the current loop and remove the unnecessary re-looping.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 98.74%) | Memory: 35.8 MB (Top 97.06%)
class Solution {
    public int findNthDigit(int n) {

        if (n < 10)
            return n;

        long currDigitIndex = 10;
        int tillNextIncrease = 90;
        int currNumberSize = 2;
        int currNumber = 10;
        int next = tillNextIncrease;

        while (currDigitIndex < n) {

            currNumber++;
            currDigitIndex += currNumberSize;
            next--;

            if (next == 0) {
                currNumberSize++;
                tillNextIncrease *= 10;
                next = tillNextIncrease;
            }
        }

        int nthDigit = currNumber % 10;
        if (currDigitIndex == n) {
            nthDigit = currNumber % 10;
        } else if (currDigitIndex > n) {
            currDigitIndex--;
            nthDigit = currNumber % 10;
            currNumber /= 10;
            while (currDigitIndex > n) {
                currDigitIndex--;
                nthDigit = currNumber % 10;
                currNumber /= 10;
            }
        }

        return nthDigit;
    }
}
