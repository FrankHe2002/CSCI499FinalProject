Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The bug introduced in the modified code is the use of the `break` statement when `prevSum` becomes negative. This breaks the inner loop prematurely and leads to incorrect calculation of the sum. The condition `(j - i + 1) % 2 == 1` correctly identifies odd-length subarrays, so the bug is with the premature loop termination.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the `break` statement and allow the loop to iterate until the end of the array.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOddLengthSubarrays(int[] arr) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int prevSum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {
                prevSum += arr[j];
                if ((j - i + 1) % 2 == 1) {
                    sum += prevSum;
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
