The bug in the provided code is that it returns the lowercase letter instead of the uppercase letter. The code uses the `Character.toLowerCase()` method to convert the character to lowercase before returning it. To fix this bug, we should remove the call to `Character.toLowerCase()` and return the character `c` as it is.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for (char cs : s.toCharArray()) c ^= cs;
        for (char ct : t.toCharArray()) c ^= ct;
        
        return c;
    }
}
```
