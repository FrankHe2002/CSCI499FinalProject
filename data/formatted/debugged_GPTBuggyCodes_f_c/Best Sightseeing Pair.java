Bug Type: Mathematical Error

Reasoning:
The bug appears to be a subtle mathematical error in the line `ans = Math.max(ans, dp[i] + values[i] - i);`. 

According to the problem statement, the goal is to find the maximum score by summing two values in the array `values` and subtracting the absolute difference between their indices. However, in the given code, `values[i] - i` is being added to `dp[i]` instead of subtracted. This will result in an incorrect score calculation.

To fix the bug, we need to subtract `values[i] - i` instead of adding it.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScoreSightseeingPair(int[] values) {
        int n = values.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = values[0];
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], values[i] + i);
            ans = Math.max(ans, dp[i] - values[i] + i); // Fixed bug by subtracting values[i] - i
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
