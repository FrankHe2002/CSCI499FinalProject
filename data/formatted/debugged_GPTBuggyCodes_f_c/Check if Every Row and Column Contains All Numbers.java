Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic error lies in the condition `if (m != 0 || k != 0 || hs.size() != n || hs1.size() != n)`. This condition checks if the sum of the elements in each row and column is equal to the expected sum `num`, and also checks if there are any duplicate elements in the rows and columns. However, the condition is incorrect because it checks if `m` and `k` are not equal to 0, when they should be equal to 0 for the matrix to be valid. Additionally, it checks if the sizes of `hs` and `hs1` are not equal to `n`, when they should be equal to `n` for the matrix to be valid. Therefore, the condition needs to be modified to fix the bug.

Fix: In order to fix the bug, the condition needs to be changed to `(m != 0 || k != 0 || hs.size() > n || hs1.size() > n || hs.size() < n || hs1.size() < n)`. This new condition checks if `m` and `k` are not equal to 0, or if the sizes of `hs` and `hs1` are not equal to `n`. If any of these conditions are true, it means that the matrix is not valid. By adding the extra checks for `hs.size() < n` and `hs1.size() < n`, the condition also accounts for the case where there are duplicate elements in the rows and columns. 

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 56 ms (Top 50.77%) | Memory: 92.4 MB (Top 46.57%)
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValid(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int num = (n * (n + 1)) / 2; // SUM of n number 1 to n;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<Integer>();
            HashSet<Integer> hs1 = new HashSet<Integer>();

            int m = num;
            int k = num;

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                hs.add(matrix[i][j]);
                hs1.add(matrix[j][i]);
                m -= matrix[i][j];
                k -= matrix[j][i];
