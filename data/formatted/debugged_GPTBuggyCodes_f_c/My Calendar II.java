Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The provided code has a logical error in the condition of the first `if` statement inside the `book` method. The condition checks if the new booking overlaps with any double bookings, but the inequality operators (`<=` and `>=`) are incorrect. The correct condition should be `start < b[1] && end > b[0]` to check for overlapping intervals.

Fix:
```java
class MyCalendarTwo {
    private List<int[]> bookings;
    private List<int[]> doubleBookings;

    public MyCalendarTwo() {
        bookings = new ArrayList<>();
        doubleBookings = new ArrayList<>();
    }


    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] b : doubleBookings) {
            // condition to check for overlapping intervals
            if (start < b[1] && end > b[0]) // fix: corrected the condition
                return false;
        }

        for (int[] b : bookings) {
            if (start < b[1] && end > b[0]) {
                doubleBookings.add(new int[] {Math.max(start, b[0]), Math.min(end, b[1])});
            }
        }
        bookings.add(new int[] {start, end});
        return true;
    }
}
```
