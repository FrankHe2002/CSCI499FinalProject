The buggy code is attempting to find the minimum number of moves required to make a given string a palindrome. 

Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The original code includes an incorrect implementation of the algorithm to make the string a palindrome.
2. The code uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to iterate from the edges of the string towards the center.
3. When encountering characters that are not equal, the code attempts to find the first matching character from the right (`k`) that can be swapped with the character at index `l`.
4. However, the algorithm fails to handle the cases where `k` is equal to `l`, causing incorrect results and potentially infinite loops.
5. Additionally, there are missing increments and decrements of `l` and `r` inside the while loop, preventing progress towards the center of the string.
6. The code also contains unnecessary print statements.

Fix:
1. Replace the while loop condition `while (l < r)` with `while (l <= r)` to include the case when `l` and `r` are equal.
2. Inside the else block, remove the condition `if (k == l)` and always perform the swap operation. This is because `k` will only be equal to `l` if there is a mismatch at the end of the string, which requires a swap.
3. Remove the while loop that iterates from `k` to `r` and only perform the swap operation once in the else block. The original implementation incorrectly swaps multiple characters instead of just one.
4. Finally, remove the unnecessary print statement.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int minMovesToMakePalindrome(String s) {
        int len = s.length();
        char[] strArr = s.toCharArray();
        int steps = 0;
        int l = 0, r = len - 1;                                           // use two pointers l for left and r for right.

        while (l <= r) {
            if (strArr[l] != strArr[r]) {                                 // Both characters are not equal.
                int k = r;
                k = findKthIndexMatchingwithLthIndex(strArr, l, k);     // loop through k, until char at index k = char at index l

                swap(strArr, k);
                steps++;

                l++;
                r--;
            } else {                                                      // Both characters are equal. so keep going further.
                l++;
                r--;
