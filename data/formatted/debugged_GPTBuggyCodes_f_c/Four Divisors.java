Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the given code, we can identify a logical error. In the original code, after checking if the count is equal to 4, the loop should not be broken, as this would prematurely terminate the loop after the first iteration. This causes the code to only sum the divisors of the first number in the array. To fix this bug, we need to remove the `break;` statement, ensuring that the loop continues to iterate over all the elements in the array and accumulate the sum of divisors for all numbers.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumFourDivisors(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i * i <= val; i++) {
                if (val % i == 0) {
                    sum += i;
                    count++;
                    if (i != val / i) {
                        sum += val / i;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (count == 4) {
                res += sum;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
