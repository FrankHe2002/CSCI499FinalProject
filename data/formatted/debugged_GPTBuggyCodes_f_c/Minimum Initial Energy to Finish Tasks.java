Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is an off-by-one error.

Reasoning:
The code has a subtle bug in the line `sum += tasks[i][0] + 1;`. By adding 1 to `tasks[i][0]`, the code is incorrectly assuming that the additional effort required for a task is always 1 more than the current task. This results in an incorrect sum calculation and affects the final result.

Fix:
To fix the bug, remove the addition of 1 to `tasks[i][0]`. The correct line should be `sum += tasks[i][0];`.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

class Solution {
    public int minimumEffort(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                return (b[1] - b[0]) - (a[1] - a[0]);
            }
        });
        int sum = 0, max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, sum + tasks[i][1]);
            sum += tasks[i][0];
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
