Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code is a solution to a problem related to video stitching. There is a bug in the code that causes an incorrect result. 

The bug is present in the line `if (can_reach > time) return cuts;`. The code checks if `can_reach` is greater than `time` and returns the number of cuts. However, the condition should be `if (can_reach >= time)` instead of `if (can_reach > time)`.

Since the condition should allow `can_reach` to be equal to `time`, the code is incorrect as it doesn't account for the case when `can_reach` is equal to `time`.

To fix the bug, the code needs to change the condition `if (can_reach > time)` to `if (can_reach >= time)`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int videoStitching(int[][] clips, int time) {
        Arrays.sort(clips, (x, y) -> x[0] == y[0] ? y[1] - x[1] : x[0] - y[0]);
        int n = clips.length;
        int interval[] = new int[2];
        int cuts = 0;
        while (true) {
            cuts++;
            int can_reach = 0;
            for (int i = interval[0]; i <= interval[1]; i++) {
                int j = 0;
                while (j < n) {
                    if (clips[j][0] < i) {
                        j++;
                    } else if (clips[j][0] == i) {
                        can_reach = Math.max(can_reach, clips[j][1]);
                        j++;
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (can_reach >= time) return cuts; // Fixed the bug: changed ">" to ">="
            }
            interval[0] = interval[1] + 1;
            interval[1] = can_reach;
            if (interval[0] > interval[1]) return - 1;
        }
    }
}
