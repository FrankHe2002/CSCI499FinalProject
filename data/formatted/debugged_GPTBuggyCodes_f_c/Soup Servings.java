Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
Looking at the `soupServings` method, it calculates the number of servings `n` and creates a 2D array `dp` to store the results of subproblems. Then, it calls the `helper` method passing in the values of `n` and `dp`. 

The `helper` method recursively calculates the probability of reaching a depleted serving by taking 4 different paths: consuming 4 servings of soup, 3 servings of soup and 1 serving of another soup, 2 servings of each soup, and 1 serving of soup and 3 servings of another soup. Finally, the probability is returned.

The bug in this code is in the `helper` method. When calculating the probability, it multiplies each recursive call by 0.25, representing the probability of choosing each path. However, the code should not return 0.5 when `a` and `b` are both 0. Instead, it should return 0 because there are no more servings to consume.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the `return 0.5` statement to `return 0` in the base case where both `a` and `b` are 0.

```java
class Solution {
    public double soupServings(int n) {
        if (n > 4800) return 1;
        n = (int) Math.ceil(n * 1.0 / 25);
        double dp[][] = new double[n + 1][n + 1];
        return helper(n, n, dp);
    }

    double helper(int a, int b, double dp[][]) {
        if (a <= 0 && b <= 0) return 0;  // Fix: Changed from 0.5 to 0
        if (b <= 0) return 0;
        if (a <= 0) return 1;
        if (dp[a][b] > 0) return dp[a][b];
        return dp[a][b] = 0.25 * (helper(a - 4, b, dp) + helper(a - 3, b - 1, dp) + helper(a - 2, b - 2, dp) + helper(a - 1, b - 3, dp));
    }
    // Subtle bug introduced below
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution
