Buggy Code Explanation: 
The provided code is attempting to perform fraction addition. However, there are multiple issues with the code:
1. The `gcd` method incorrectly calculates the greatest common divisor. It uses the modulo operator incorrectly, which can result in incorrect results. The bug type in this case is a logical error.
2. The `add` method incorrectly adds the fractions. The code assumes that if the numerator or denominator of one fraction is 0, the result should be the other fraction. This is incorrect as it ignores the actual addition operation. Additionally, there is an issue with handling the sign of the resulting fraction. The bug types in this method are logical errors and missing code.
3. The `fractionAddition` method has incorrect logic for splitting the expression into fractions. It uses the `replaceAll` method to replace `-` with `+-`, which can lead to incorrect splitting. The bug type in this method is a logical error.
4. The `fractionAddition` method lacks proper error handling for cases where the input expression is empty or invalid. The bug type in this method is a missing code.

Based on the above analysis, the fix would involve:
1. Updating the `gcd` method to correctly calculate the greatest common divisor.
2. Updating the `add` method to correctly perform fraction addition.
3. Updating the `fractionAddition` method to correctly split the expression into fractions and handle error cases.
4. Applying the fixes mentioned above with minimal changes to the code.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.stream.Stream;

class Solution {
    // Greatest Common Divisor
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (a == 0) return b;
        return gcd(b % a, a);
    }

    private int[] add(int[] a, int[] b) {
        int[] ret = new int[] {a[0] * b[1] + b[0] * a[1], a[1] * b[1]};
        int sign = ret[0] >= 0 ? 1 : -1;
        ret[0] *= sign;
        int g = gcd(Math.abs(ret[0]), Math.abs(ret[1]));
        if (g > 1) {
            ret[0] /= g;
            ret[1] /= g;
        }
        ret[0] *= sign;
        return ret;
    }
