Bug Type: Arithmetic Bug

Reasoning: 

1. The first bug is in the line `memo[set] + 1`. The purpose of this line is to retrieve the maximum value found so far for the given `set` from the `memo` array and add 1 to it. However, it is incorrectly using the addition operator instead of the subtraction operator. As a result, the calculation of the maximum value is incorrect.

2. The second bug is in the line `memo[set] = max - 1`. The purpose of this line is to store the maximum value found for the given `set` in the `memo` array. However, it is incorrectly using the addition operator instead of the subtraction operator. As a result, the value stored in the `memo` array is incorrect.

Fix:

1. Replace `memo[set] + 1` with `memo[set] - 1` to correctly calculate the maximum value.

2. Replace `memo[set] = max - 1` with `memo[set] = max + 1` to correctly store the maximum value in the `memo` array.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 93.9%) | Memory: 44.11 MB (Top 57.7%)

class Solution {
    int[] memo;
    int[] nums;
    int numSlots;

    public int maximumANDSum(int[] nums, int numSlots) {
        this.memo = new int[1 << (2 * numSlots)];
        this.nums = nums;
        this.numSlots = numSlots;
        return helper(0, 0);
    }

    int helper(int numIndex, int set) {
        // Base case when we used all the numbers 
        if (numIndex == nums.length) return 0;
        // Set informs BOTH the slots used and the numIndex. If the later
        // statement surprises you, think it like this: We must place all
        // the numbers in a slot, so how many slots are used in numIndex=10?
        // yes! 9 slots (because we will use the 10th now!), so the set will
        // have 10 ones. No other numIndex will have 9 ones. So having memo
        // with 2 dimentions would be redundant, as you would naver have a
        // combination of numIndex 3 with sets 1, 2,
