Buggy Code Explanation:

There is a subtle bug in the provided code that causes incorrect results for some inputs. The bug is present in the `pow` method, where the variable `exp` is left-shifted (`exp <<= 1`) instead of being right-shifted to perform integer division by 2.

The reasoning behind identifying this bug is as follows:
- The `pow` method is used to calculate a power of `base` by repeatedly multiplying `base` by itself.
- The loop condition `exp != 0` indicates that the loop should continue until `exp` becomes zero.
- Inside the loop, the `exp` variable should be divided by 2 to approach zero with each iteration. This division is usually performed using a right-shift operation (`exp >>= 1`) to achieve integer division by 2.
- However, the code mistakenly left-shifts `exp` (`exp <<= 1`) which effectively doubles its value with each iteration.
- This incorrect operation causes incorrect results for powers of `base` that are greater than 2.

To fix this bug, the left-shift operation needs to be replaced with a right-shift operation. The fixed code also includes minimal changes such as adjusting the indentation and adding a missing semicolon at the end of the statement inside the loop.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    static long pow(long base, long exp) {
        long ans = 1;
        for (; exp != 0; ) {
            if ((exp & 1) == 1) {
                ans *= base;
            }
            base *= base;
            exp >>= 1; // fix: use right-shift instead of left-shift
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public String nearestPalindromic(String n) {
        long num = Long.parseLong(n);
        if (num <= 10) {
            return String.valueOf(num - 1);
        }
        long comp[] = new long[5];
        comp[0] = pow(10, n.length() - 1) - 1;
        comp[1] = pow(10, n.length()) + 1;
        int mid = (n.length() + 1) / 2;
        long half = Long.parseLong(n.substring(0, mid));
        long pref[] = {half, half + 1, half - 1};
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            StringBuilder st = new StringBuilder(String.valueOf(pref[i]));
