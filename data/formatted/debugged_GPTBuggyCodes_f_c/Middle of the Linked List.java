The bug in the provided code is that it does not handle the case of an even-sized linked list properly. If the linked list has an even number of nodes, the code will return the node at index `size / 2`, which is incorrect. It should return the node at index `size / 2 + 1` to correctly identify the middle node in an even-sized list.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the middle index (`mid`) and the loop condition of the second loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode temp = head;
        int size = 0;
        while (temp != null) {
            size++;
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        int mid = size / 2 + 1; // Adjusted calculation for middle index
        temp = head;
        for (int i = 1; i < mid; i++) { // Adjusted loop condition
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        return temp;
    }
}
```
