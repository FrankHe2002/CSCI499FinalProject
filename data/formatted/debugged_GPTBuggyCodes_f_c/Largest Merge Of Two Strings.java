Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code tries to merge two words (`word1` and `word2`) into a single word by greedily choosing the largest characters in each position. However, there is a bug in the `check` method. The bug is that when `w1[i] > w2[j]`, the code incorrectly returns `false` instead of `true`, indicating that we need to extract from `word1` instead of `word2`. This bug causes the incorrect selection of characters and the resulting merged word is not the largest possible merge.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `return false;` inside the `check` method to `return true;` when `w1[i] > w2[j]`. This change will correctly indicate that we need to extract a character from `word1` instead of `word2` when they are equal.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String largestMerge(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        char[] w1 = word1.toCharArray();
        char[] w2 = word2.toCharArray();

        int n1 = w1.length;
        int n2 = w2.length;

        // we loop until we exhaust any one of the 2 words completely
        while (i < n1 && j < n2) {

            // if both the characters are equal we choose the one where the next largest occurs earlier
            if (w1[i] == w2[j]) {
                if (!check(w1, i, w2, j)) {
                    sb.append(w1[i++]);
                } else {
                    sb.append(w2[j++]);
                }
            }

            // else we greedily choose the largest of the two characters
            else if (w1[i] > w2[j]) {
                sb.append(w1[i++]);
            } else {
                sb.append(w2[j++]);
            }
        }

        // at the end of the loop we append any remaining word
        sb.append(word1.substring(i));
        sb.append(word2.substring(j));

        return sb.toString();
    }

    private boolean check(char[] w1, int i, char[] w2, int j) {
        // will return true if we need to extract from word1 and false if we need to extract from word2

        while (i < w1.length && j < w
