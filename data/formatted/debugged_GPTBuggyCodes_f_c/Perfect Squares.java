Bug Type: Index Out Of Bounds

Reasoning: The bug occurs in the line `dp[n][i] = Math.min(nottake, take);`. The variable `i` is the index used to access elements in the `coins` ArrayList, which has a size of `perfect_squares.size()`. However, in the last recursive call `i = 0`, which is an invalid index. This results in an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. 

Fix: Change the condition in the second base case from `if (i <= 0)` to `if (i <= 0 || i > coins.size())`. This condition ensures that `i` remains within the valid index range.
