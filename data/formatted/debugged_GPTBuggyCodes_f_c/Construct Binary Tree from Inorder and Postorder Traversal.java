Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code is attempting to build a binary tree using an inorder traversal array (`io`) and a postorder traversal array (`po`). However, there are several issues with the code:
1. The `n` variable is not initialized correctly. It should be set to `postorder.length - 1` instead of `inorder.length - 1`.
2. The condition `if (n < 0 || low > high)` is incorrect. It should be `if (low > high)` since `n` can be non-zero even if there are still more nodes to process.
3. The variable `currNode` incorrectly assigns `po[n--]`. It should be `po[this.n--]` to refer to the class member variable `n`.
4. The recursive calls to `buildTree` should be passed `this.n` instead of `n` since `n` is shared among the recursive calls.
5. The `main` method is placed inside the class `Solution` instead of being a separate class or a `static` method.
6. The `inorder` and `postorder` methods should be static since they are called from the `main` method, which is also static.

To fix the issues, the following changes need to be made to the code:

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    int[] io;
    int[] po;
    int n;   // nth post order node 

    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] inorder, int[] postorder) {
        this.n = postorder.length - 1;
        this.io = inorder;
        this.po = postorder;
        return buildTree(0, n);
    }

    public TreeNode buildTree(int low, int high) {
        if (low > high) return null;
        int currNode = po[this.n--];
        int idxInInorder = low;
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(currNode);
        if (low == high) return root;   // no more nodes

        while (io[idxInInorder] != currNode) idxInInorder++; // find index of currNode in inorder
        root.right = buildTree(idxInInorder + 1, high);
        root.left = buildTree(low, idxInInorder - 1);
        return root;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        int[] inorder = {1, 2, 3
