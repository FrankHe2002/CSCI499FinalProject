The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition `i < 4`, which attempts to iterate through four elements in the `order` array. However, the `order` array only has three elements (`{60, 15, 5, 1}`). As a result, the code will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when it tries to access `order[3]`.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the loop condition to `i < 3` to ensure that the loop iterates only through the three valid elements in the `order` array.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 77.73%) | Memory: 42.8 MB (Top 23.55%)
class Solution {
    public int HHMMToMinutes(String s) {
        return Integer.parseInt(s.substring(0, 2)) * 60 + Integer.parseInt(s.substring(3, 5));
    }

    public int convertTime(String current, String correct) {
        int diff = HHMMToMinutes(correct) - HHMMToMinutes(current);
        int[] order = {60, 15, 5, 1};
        int i = 0;
        int ops = 0;
        while (i < 3) {
            ops += (diff / order[i]);
            diff %= order[i];
            i++;
        }
        return ops;
    }
}
```
