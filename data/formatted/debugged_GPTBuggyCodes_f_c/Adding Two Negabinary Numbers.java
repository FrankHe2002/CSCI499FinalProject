Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation: The bug in the provided code lies in the calculation of the `current` and `carry` variables based on the `sum` variable. The logic used to determine these values is incorrect. 

The intention of the code is to perform negabinary addition of two arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`). Negabinary addition involves adding two binary digits and considering the carry. The possible values for the sum are 0, 1, 2, 3, and -1. Since negabinary digits can only be 0 or 1, the correct calculation involves reducing the sum by multiples of 2 until it falls within the valid range.

The bugs in the code are as follows:
1. The conditions `if (sum == 3)` and `if (sum == -1)` are incorrect because they do not handle the correct values of `current` and `carry`. Instead, these conditions should handle values outside the valid range of negabinary digits.
2. The conditions `if (sum == 2)` and `if (sum == 1)` are also incorrect. These conditions should handle values within the valid range of negabinary digits and calculate the correct `current` and `carry` values based on the sum.

To fix these bugs, the following changes need to be made:
1. Change `if (sum == 3)` to `if (sum > 1)`.
2. Change `if (sum == 2)` to `if (sum == 1)`.
3. Change `if (sum == 1)` to `if (sum == 0)`.
4. Change `if (sum == 0)` to `if (sum == -1)`.
5. Update the logic of calculating `carry` to consider the negative values instead of -1.

        int pointer_1 = arr1.length - 1;
        int pointer_2 = arr2.length - 1;

        int carry = 0;
        int current = 0;
        int sum = 0;

        while (pointer_1 >= 0 || pointer_2 >= 0) {
