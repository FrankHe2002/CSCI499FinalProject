Bug Type: Mathematical error

Reasoning: 
The buggy code attempts to calculate a concatenated binary number. However, there is a mathematical error in the expression `(int) Math.pow(2, Integer.toBinaryString(i + 1).length())`. The intention is to calculate the power of 2 based on the length of the binary string representation of `(i + 1)`. However, the current expression wrongly calculates the length of `(i + 1)` instead of `i`. This results in an incorrect power of 2, leading to incorrect calculations and an incorrect final result.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the expression `(int) Math.pow(2, Integer.toBinaryString(i + 1).length())` should be changed to `(int) Math.pow(2, Integer.toBinaryString(i).length())`. This ensures that the length of `i` is used in the calculation, aligning the expression with the intended logic.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 19 ms (Top 85.15%) | Memory: 39.4 MB (Top 90.15%)
class Solution {
    public int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            res = (res * (int) Math.pow(2, Integer.toBinaryString(i).length()) + i) % 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```
