The bug in the provided code is that the `count` and `maxOR` variables are declared outside the recursive `subsets` method but are not reset to their initial values before each test case. This can lead to incorrect counting and storing of the maximum OR value.

To fix this bug, we need to reset the `count` and `maxOR` variables before each test case.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countMaxOrSubsets(int[] nums) {
        count = 0;
        maxOR = 0;
        subsets(nums, 0, 0);
        return count;
    }

    int count;
    int maxOR;

    private void subsets(int[] arr, int vidx, int OR) {
        if (vidx == arr.length) {
            if (OR == maxOR) {
                count++;
            } else if (OR > maxOR) {
                count = 1;
                maxOR = OR;
            }
            return;
        }

        // include
        subsets(arr, vidx + 1, OR | arr[vidx]);

        // exclude
        subsets(arr, vidx + 1, OR);
    }
}
```
Note that I also fixed the recursion by incrementing `vidx` in the `exclude` branch of the `subsets` method to prevent an infinite recursion.
