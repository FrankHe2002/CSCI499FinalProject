Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 
The provided code aims to determine whether an array is a "good" array based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) operation. However, there is a logic error in the code. The condition `gcd == 2` is used to determine if the array is "good", which is incorrect. The GCD operation is performed using the `GCD` method, which itself implements the correct GCD logic.

Fix: 
To fix the bug, the condition should be changed from `gcd == 2` to `gcd == 1` to correctly determine if the array is "good". This aligns with the logic implemented by the `GCD` method.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isGoodArray(int[] nums) {
        int gcd = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            gcd = GCD(gcd, nums[i]);
            if (gcd == 1)
                return true;
        }
        return gcd == 1;
    }

    int GCD(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return GCD(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
```
