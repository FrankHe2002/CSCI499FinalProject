The bug in the given code is in the second for loop condition `i <= s.length()`. The condition should be `i < s.length()` because the loop control variable `i` should not go beyond the length of the string `s`. 

Additionally, there is another issue with the code where the `String[] strs` is initialized with an incorrect size. It should be `String[] strs = new String[(s.length() + k - 1) / k];` to ensure the array has enough space for all the divisions.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String[] divideString(String s, int k, char fill) {
        int rem = 0;
        if (s.length() % k != 0) {
            rem = k - s.length() % k; //counting the total positions where we have to fill the char "fill".
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < rem; i++) {
            s = s + fill; //appending the char to the String
        }

        String[] strs = new String[(s.length() + k - 1) / k];  //the length will be (String length + K - 1) / K because we are making pairs of k length Strings.
        int index = 0;  //index for array.
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += k) { // fixed the loop condition
            strs[index] = s.substring(i, i + k); //substring of current element to Kth element.
            index++;
        }
        return strs;
    }
}
```
