Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
The bug is a logical error in the calculation of the XOR sum. The current implementation XORs each element of array `x` with the XOR sum of all elements in array `y`. This is incorrect because the XOR sum needs to be calculated between the corresponding elements of arrays `x` and `y`. 

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over both arrays simultaneously and XOR the corresponding elements.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 7 ms (Top 20.86%) | Memory: 82 MB (Top 80.58%)
class Solution {

    public int getXORSum(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int[] x = (arr1.length < arr2.length ? arr2 : arr1);
        int[] y = (arr1.length < arr2.length ? arr1 : arr2);
        int answer = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
            answer ^= (x[i] & y[i]);
        }
        return answer;
    }

}
```
