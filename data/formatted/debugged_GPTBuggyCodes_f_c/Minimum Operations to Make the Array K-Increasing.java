Buggy Code Explanation:

The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition of the outer for loop (`for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++)`). The loop condition should be `i < k` instead of `i <= k` to ensure the loop iterates only `k` times. 

In the `tails` array, the code keeps track of the highest element that can be added to each subsequence. If a higher element is found, it replaces the previously stored element, thereby maintaining the increasing order of the subsequence. The code mistakenly includes an extra iteration of the outer loop, which leads to an array index out of bounds exception.

The fix is to change the loop condition to `i < k`.

Furthermore, the code correctly checks if `size == 0` to handle the first element of the subsequence, but it mistakenly uses the condition `arr[j] >= tails[size - 1]` instead of `arr[j] > tails[size - 1]` to handle subsequent elements. If the subsequent element is equal to the last element of the subsequence, it should not be added to the subsequence because the problem states that the subsequence must be strictly increasing.

To fix this, change `arr[j] >= tails[size - 1]` to `arr[j] > tails[size - 1]` in the if condition.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int kIncreasing(int[] arr, int k) {
        int ans = arr.length;
        int[] tails = new int[arr.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) { // Changed i <= k to i < k
            int size = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < arr.length; j += k) {
                if (size == 0 || arr[j] > tails[size - 1]) { // Changed arr[j] >= tails[size - 1] to arr[j] > tails[size - 1]
                    tails[size++] = arr[j];
                } else {
                    int low = 0, high = size - 1;
                    while (low <= high) {
                        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
                        if (tails[mid] <= arr[j] && tails[mid + 1] > arr[j]) {
                            tails[mid + 1] = arr[j];
                            break;
                        } else if (tails[mid + 1] <= arr
