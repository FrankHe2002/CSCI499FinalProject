The bug in the provided buggy code is in the `cut` method. 

Explanation:
1. The `cut` method defines the base case as `if (i > j)`, which checks if `i` is greater than `j`. However, the problem statement suggests that the base case should be `if (i >= j)`, meaning if `i` is greater than or equal to `j`. This is because we want to handle the case where there is only one cut left (i.e., `i == j`). In this case, we should return 0, indicating that no more cuts can be made.
2. The line `int cost = cuts[j + 1] - cuts[i - 1] - cut(cuts, i, k - 1, dp) + cut(cuts, k + 1, j, dp);` should be adjusted. The subtraction `cuts[j + 1] - cuts[i - 1]` calculates the length of the current segment, but it should be `cuts[j] - cuts[i]`. This is because the cuts array is 1-based, and the index `j` already points to the last element in the segment, so we need to subtract `cuts[i]`.
3. The recursive calls `cut(cuts, i, k - 1, dp)` and `cut(cuts, k + 1, j, dp)` have incorrect parameters. The correct range for the recursive calls is `i` to `k - 1` and `k + 1` to `j`, respectively. Currently, the code passes `cuts` instead of `cuts`, causing incorrect calculations. 

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minCost(int n, int[] cuts) {

        int len = cuts.length;

        Arrays.sort(cuts);

        int[] arr = new int[len + 2];
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++)
            arr[i] = cuts[i - 1];

        arr[0] = 0;
        arr[len + 1] = n;
        int[][] dp = new int[len + 1][len + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j <= len; j++)
                dp[i][j] = -1;
        return cut(arr, 1, len, dp);
    }
