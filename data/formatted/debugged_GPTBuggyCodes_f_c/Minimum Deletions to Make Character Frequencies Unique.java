Bug Type: Missing Value Assignment

Reasoning: In the provided code, `array` is defined as an array of `int` with a length of `N` (26). The goal of the code is to count the frequency of each character in the input string `s` and calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make all frequencies unique. The issue is with the indexing of the `array` while counting the frequencies. In Java, characters are represented as Unicode values, and lowercase 'a' has a Unicode value of 97. However, the code subtracts 97 from the character value, assuming that 'a' has an index of 0 in `array`. This assumption is incorrect since 'a' should have an index of 0 in the array. Therefore, to fix the bug, we need to change the subtraction value from 97 to 97 - 'a' to ensure that the character 'a' has an index of 0 in `array`. 

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    private int N = 26;

    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        int[] array = new int[N];
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            array[ch - 'a']++;  // Change 'a' to 'a'
        }
        int ans = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : array) {
            if (i == 0) continue;
            while (set.contains(i)) {
                i--;
                ans++;
            }
            if (i != 0) {
                set.add(i);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
