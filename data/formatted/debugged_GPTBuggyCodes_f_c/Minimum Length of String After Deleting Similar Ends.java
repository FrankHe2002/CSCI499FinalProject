Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code aims to find the minimum length of a string `s` by iteratively removing characters from both ends of the string if they are the same.
2. The bug in this code is the line `left--;` inside the `else` block.
3. This line incorrectly decrements the value of `left`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

Fix:

To fix this bug, we need to remove the line `left--;` and adjust the loop condition accordingly. We also need to remove the `break` statement, as it is unnecessary.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        int length = s.length();
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        for (int left = 0, right = chars.length - 1; left < right; ) {
            if (chars[left] == chars[right]) {
                char c = chars[left];
                while (left < right && chars[left] == c) {
                    left++;
                    length--;
                }

                while (right >= left && chars[right] == c) {
                    right--;
                    length--;
                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
}
```
