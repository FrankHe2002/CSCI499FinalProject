Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning: Upon analyzing the code, it can be observed that the bug occurs in the line `int idx = (nums.length) / 2;` where the `idx` variable is calculated. The goal is to find the median index of the sorted array. However, array indices in Java start from 0, so subtracting 1 from the denominator is necessary to get the correct median index. 

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int idx = (nums.length - 1) / 2; // Subtracting 1 from denominator to get correct median index
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[idx]);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
