Bug Type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning: The provided buggy code calculates the maximum distance between two different colors in an array. It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, at the start and end of the array, respectively. It then loops while the color at `l` is the same as the color at the end of the array, incrementing `l`. Similarly, it loops while the color at `r` is the same as the color at the start of the array, decrementing `r`. Finally, it calculates the maximum distance using the formula `Math.max(r, colors.length - l - 1)`. However, there is an off-by-one error in this calculation. 

Fix: Change the formula from `Math.max(r, colors.length - 1 - l)` to `Math.max(r, colors.length - l - 1)`. By removing the unnecessary `- 1` operation, the formula will correctly calculate the maximum distance between the two different colors in the array.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 42.7 MB (Top 13.21%)
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] colors) {
        int l = 0, r = colors.length - 1;
        while (colors[colors.length - 1] == colors[l]) l++;
        while (colors[0] == colors[r]) r--;
        return Math.max(r, colors.length - l - 1);
    }
}
