Bug Type: Recursive logic error.

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `insertIntoBST` method is intended to insert a new node with the given value into a binary search tree. However, there is an issue with the recursive logic in the code. 

In the code, when inserting a new value, if the value is less than or equal to the root's value, it should be inserted in the left subtree. Otherwise, it should be inserted in the right subtree. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where the root's value is equal to the new value correctly. 

If the new value is equal to the root's value, it should ideally be inserted in the left subtree to maintain the order of the binary search tree. However, the code currently inserts it in the right subtree, leading to an incorrect tree structure.

Bug Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic to check for equality with the root's value and insert accordingly. We can update the code as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode insertIntoBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        if (root == null) return new TreeNode(val);

        if (root.val > val) root.left = insertIntoBST(root.left, val);

        else if (root.val < val) root.right = insertIntoBST(root.right, val);

        return root;
    }
}
```
Note: The original code checks `root.val >= val`, but it should ideally be `root.val > val` to insert equal values in the left subtree. However, since the prompt asks for minimal changes, we can keep the original comparison and change it to `root.val > val` when addressing the bug.
