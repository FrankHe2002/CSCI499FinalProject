The bug in the provided code is in the `lengthOfLastWord` method. The variable `flag` is used to track if we have encountered a space character yet. The intention is to count the length of the last word in the string `s`. However, there is a bug in the code where, instead of setting `flag` to `false` when a non-space character is encountered, it is set to `true`. This causes the loop to continue counting the length of the last word beyond the first non-space character encountered after any spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to set `flag` to `false` when a non-space character is encountered, indicating that we have already counted the length of the last word. The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.9 MB (Top 78.55%)
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int j = s.length() - 1, len = 0;
        boolean flag = true;
        while (j >= 0 && (flag || (!flag && s.charAt(j) != ' ')))
            if (s.charAt(j--) != ' ') {
                flag = false; // Fix the bug by setting flag to false instead of true
                len++;
            }
        return len;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we change `flag = true` to `flag = false` in order to correctly track the length of the last word in the string.
