Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code is checking if it is possible to modify at most one element in the array `nums` to make it non-decreasing. However, there is a logical error in the code. 

The condition `if (index - 2 >= 0 && nums[index - 2] > nums[index])` is checking if the current number violates the non-decreasing order by comparing it with the number two indices before it. However, this comparison is incorrect. It should be comparing `nums[index - 1]` with `nums[index]` in order to check if modifying the current number would make the array non-decreasing. Additionally, the condition inside the if statement should check if `nums[index - 2]` is greater than `nums[index - 1]`, not `nums[index]`.

Bug Type:
Logical error

Fix and Reasoning:
To fix this error, we need to change the condition inside the if statement to `if (nums[index - 2] > nums[index - 1])`. This would correctly check if modifying the current number would result in a non-decreasing array. Additionally, we should also update the condition in the for loop to `index = 1` instead of `index = 0` to start the loop from the second element.

Fixed Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkPossibility(int[] nums) {
        int modified = 0, prev = nums[0], index = 1;
        for (; index < nums.length; ++index) {
            if (nums[index] < prev) {
                if (++modified > 1) return false;
                if (index - 2 >= 0 && nums[index - 2] > nums[index - 1]) break;
            }
            prev = nums[index];
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
