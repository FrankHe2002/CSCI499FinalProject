Bug Type: Logical error (missing condition handling)

Reasoning: The buggy code has a logical error where it fails to handle the condition when `x == 0` and `y == 0`. This condition is incorrectly handled in the else block that returns `z`. However, the else block is unnecessary because it duplicates the return statement in the subsequent block. Thus, removing the else block will introduce the bug and fail to handle the `x == 0 && y == 0` case.

Fix: Remove the unnecessary else block and its contents.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 59.66%) | Memory: 41.5 MB (Top 48.39%)
class Solution {
    public int fillCups(int[] amount) {
        Arrays.sort(amount);
        int x = amount[0];
        int y = amount[1];
        int z = amount[2];
        int sum = x + y + z;
        if (x + y > z) {
            return sum / 2 + sum % 2;
        }
        return z;
    }
}
```
