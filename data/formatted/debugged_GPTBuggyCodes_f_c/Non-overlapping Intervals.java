Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code sorts the intervals array in descending order based on the start time of each interval (`Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);`).
2. The code then initializes the variables `start` and `end` with the start and end times of the first interval in the sorted array (`int start = intervals[0][0];` and `int end = intervals[0][1];`).
3. The code iterates through the remaining intervals starting from the second interval (`for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++)`).
4. For each interval, the code checks if the start time of the interval is greater than or equal to the current `start` and less than the current `end` (`if (interval[0] >= start && interval[0] < end)`).
5. If the condition is true, it means there is an overlap between the current interval and the previous interval, so the code increments the `res` variable and continues to the next iteration if the end time of the current interval is greater than or equal to the current `end` (`if (interval[1] >= end) continue;`).
6. If the condition is false, it means there is no overlap, so the code updates the `start` and `end` variables with the start and end times of the current interval (`start = interval[0];` and `end = interval[1];`).

Bug: The bug in the code is that it sorts the intervals array in descending order instead of ascending order. Sorting the array in descending order based on the start time will lead to incorrect results because the subsequent logic assumes the intervals are sorted in ascending order.

Fix: To fix the bug, the code should change the sorting order to ascending by modifying the comparison in the lambda expression used for sorting to `a[0] - b[0]` instead of `b[0] - a[0]`.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]); // fix: sort in ascending order

        int start = intervals[0][0];
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1;
