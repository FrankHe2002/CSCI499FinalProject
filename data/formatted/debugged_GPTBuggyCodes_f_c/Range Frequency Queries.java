The bug type in the provided code is a syntax error.

Reasoning Process:
1. The line `tree.put(i, tree.size());` causes a syntax error because it is missing a closing parenthesis.
2. The semicolon at the end of the line suggests that the statement is complete, but it is missing an opening parenthesis before `i`.
3. Since `tree.put()` is a method call, it should have an opening parenthesis before the arguments.
4. Adding an opening parenthesis before `i` will fix the syntax error.

Fixed Code:
```java
tree.put(i, (tree.size() + 1));
```
