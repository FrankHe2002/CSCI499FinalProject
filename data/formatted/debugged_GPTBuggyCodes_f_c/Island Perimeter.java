The bug in the provided code is caused by the condition `i < row` in the last if statement inside the nested loop. This condition should check if `i + 1` is within the valid range of indices (`0` to `row - 1`), but it fails to handle the case when `i + 1` is equal to `row`. This causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `i` is at the last row of the grid.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition inside the if statement to `i < row - 1`. This ensures that `i + 1` is a valid index within the grid.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 10 ms (Top 73.55%) | Memory: 62.3 MB (Top 52.61%)
class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;

        int row = grid.length, col = grid[0].length;
        int perimeter = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {

                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    perimeter += 4;

                    if (i > 0 && grid[i - 1][j] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }

                    if (j > 0 && grid[i][j - 1] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }
                    
                    // Fixed the bug by changing the condition to i < row - 1
                    if (i < row - 1 && grid[i + 1][j] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }
                }

            }
        }
        return perimeter;
    }
}
```
