The bug in the provided code is a logical error in the inner for loop. The loop should iterate from index 0 to `n - 1` (inclusive), but it mistakenly iterates from index 0 to `n` (inclusive) due to the loop condition `j < n + 1`. This causes an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` as the loop tries to access an index outside the valid range of `boxes` string.

To fix the bug, the loop condition should be changed to `j < n` to ensure that the loop iterates only within the valid range of the string.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 135 ms (Top 50.7%) | Memory: 44.02 MB (Top 24.4%)

class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length();
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int t = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { // fix: change n + 1 to n
                char c = boxes.charAt(j);
                if (c == '1') t += Math.abs(i - j);
            }
            ans[i] = t;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
