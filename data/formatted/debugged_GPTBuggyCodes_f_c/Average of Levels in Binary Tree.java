Bug Type: Arithmetic Error

Reasoning: In the original code, there is an arithmetic error in the line `ans.add(row / (qlen-1))`. The intention seems to be to calculate the average of the values in each level. However, instead of subtracting 1 from `qlen` to exclude the root node from the calculation, it should be divided by `qlen` itself to obtain the average. Dividing by `(qlen-1)` results in an incorrect average calculation.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 97.1%) | Memory: 45.45 MB (Top 6.9%)

class Solution {
    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>(List.of(root));
        List<Double> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (q.size() > 0) {
            double qlen = q.size(), row = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < qlen; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = q.poll();
                row += curr.val;
                if (curr.left != null) q.offer(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) q.offer(curr.right);
            }
            ans.add(row / qlen);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
