Bug Type: Logical Bug

Reasoning: By changing the condition from `total < buckets` to `total <= buckets` in the `while` loop, the code introduces a logical bug. With the new condition, the loop will continue until `total` is greater than or equal to `buckets`. This means that when `total` becomes greater than `buckets`, the loop will still execute one more time and increment `cnt`. This results in an incorrect value for `cnt` because it includes an extra increment.

Fix:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 40.5 MB (Top 75.55%)
class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        int total = 1;
        while (total < buckets) { // Fixed the condition to "<" to accurately count the number of pigs needed
            total *= T;
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 40.5 MB (Top 75.55%)
class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        int total = 1;
        while (total < buckets) { // Fixed the condition to "<" to accurately count the number of pigs needed
            total *= T;
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
