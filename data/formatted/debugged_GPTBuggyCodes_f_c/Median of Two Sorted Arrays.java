Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning: 
1. In the given code, the variable `k` is used to track the index of the merged array `nums`.
2. There is a condition `nums1.length != 0 && nums2.length != 0` which ensures that both `nums1` and `nums2` are non-empty arrays.
3. Inside this condition, there is a while loop that merges the two arrays based on the values of `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`.
4. However, after this while loop, there is an additional while loop that is checking for any remaining elements in `nums1`, but there is no equivalent loop for checking remaining elements in `nums2`.
5. This leads to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when the loop `while (j < nums2.length)` is commented out, as the array `nums` does not have enough elements to accommodate all the remaining elements of `nums2`.
6. To fix this bug, we need to uncomment the line `k++` inside the while loop for `j < nums2.length` so that the index `k` is incremented for each element of `nums2`.

class Solution {
    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        if (nums1.length == 1 && nums2.length == 1) return (double) (nums1[0] + nums2[0]) / 2.0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int k = 0;
        int nums[] = new int[nums1.length + nums2.length];
        if (nums1.length != 0 && nums2.length != 0) {
            while (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length) {
                if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                    nums[k] = nums1[i];
                    i++;
                    k++;
                } else {
                    nums[k] = nums2[j];
                    j++;
                    k++;
                }
            }
            while (i < nums1.length) {
                nums[k] = nums1[i];
                i++;
                k++;
            }
            while (j < nums2.length) {
                nums[k] = nums2[j];
                j++;
