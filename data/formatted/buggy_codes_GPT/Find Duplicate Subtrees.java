```java
hash += root.val + "ROOT,";
```

This line concatenates the value of the root node with the string "ROOT," and appends it to the `hash` string. However, the problem is that this line is inside the `dfs` method, which is called recursively. As a result, every time the `dfs` method is called, this line will be executed again, adding the value of the root node to the `hash` string multiple times. This will result in incorrect hash values and incorrect duplicate subtree detection.
