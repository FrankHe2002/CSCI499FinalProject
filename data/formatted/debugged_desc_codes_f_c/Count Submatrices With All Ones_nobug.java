The bug in this code is in the calculation of the `dp` array, which does not correctly count the number of submatrices with i, j as the lower right corner. The calculation of the `dp` array is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

The fixed calculation should be:
- Calculate the height of the rectangle formed with i, j as the lower-right corner and expanding towards the left using the left array.
- Find the minimum height of the rectangle when encountering a 1 and sum up all such minHeights to the dp.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubmat(int[][] mat) {
        int n = mat.length;
        int m = mat[0].length;
        //left[i][j] indicates how many consecutive 1s are on the left of i, j
        //up[i][j] indicates how many consecutive 1s are above i, j
        //dp[i][j] represents the number of submatrices with i, j as the lower right corner
        int[][] left = new int[n][m];
        int[][] up = new int[n][m];
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1) {
                    up[i][j] = (i == 0) ? 1 : up[i - 1][j] + 1;
                    left[i][j] = (j == 0) ? 1 : left[i][j - 1] + 1;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 0) {
                    continue;
                }
               
                int minHeight = left[i][j];
                
                for (int k = 0; k < up[i][j]; k++) {
                    minHeight = Math.min(minHeight, left[i][j - k]);
                    res += minHeight;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
