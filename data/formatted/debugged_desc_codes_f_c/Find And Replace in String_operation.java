The bug type in the provided code is a logical error.

The following reasoning process was used to identify and fix the bug:


For the code provided to run the algorithm to perform the replacement operations and return the resulting string after performing all replacement operations, fixing the following is required:

1. Initialize a sorting array of indices, to know the actual positions of the characters inside the string. 
2. Use a for loop for iterating through the input string.
3. Use a conditional statement to check if a specific index matches the indices array.
4. Inside the conditional statement, the result needs to be updated with the value in the targets array that corresponds to the same index in the indices array.
5. Check whether the replacement operations have been performed simultaneously, ensuring that one replacement operation doesn't affect the indexing of another.
6. Return the updated string after the replacement operations.

The fixed version of the code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public String findReplaceString(String s, int[] indices, String[] sources, String[] targets) {

        HashMap<Integer, String> subst = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Integer, String> tgt = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
            subst.put(indices[i], sources[i]);
            tgt.put(indices[i], targets[i]);
        }

        Arrays.sort(indices);

        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (count < indices.length && i == indices[count] && s.substring(i).startsWith(subst.get(indices[count]))) {
                res.append(tgt.get(indices[count]));
                i = i + subst.get(indices[count]).length();
                count++;
            } else {
                if (count < indices.length && i == indices[count])
                    count++;
                res.append(s.charAt(i++));
            }
        }

        return res.toString();
    }
}
```
