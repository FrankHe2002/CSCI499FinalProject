The bug in the provided code is located in the `go` method of the `FindElements` class. Specifically, the `go` method has an incorrect recursive implementation to recover the contaminated binary tree.

The fix for this would involve correcting the recursive implementation within the `go` method to properly recover the binary tree. This should be done by adding a check for `null` before assigning a value to the `node.left` and `node.right` to avoid a `NullPointerException`.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class FindElements {
    TreeNode tree, nodept;

    public FindElements(TreeNode root) {
        tree = root;
        if (tree != null) {
            tree.val = 0;
            recoverTree(tree);
        }
    }

    void recoverTree(TreeNode node) {
        if (node.left != null) {
            node.left.val = node.val * 2 + 1;
            recoverTree(node.left);
        }
        if (node.right != null) {
            node.right.val = node.val * 2 + 2;
            recoverTree(node.right);
        }
    }

    public boolean find(int target) {
        return findTarget(target);
    }

    boolean findTarget(int target) {
        if (target == 0) {
            nodept = tree;
            return true;
        }
        if (nodept == null) {
            return false;
        } else if (nodept.left != null && nodept.left.val == target) {
            nodept = nodept.left;
            return true;
        } else if (nodept.right != null && nodept.right.val == target) {
            nodept = nodept.right;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
The fixed code initializes the object with a contaminated binary tree and recovers it as intended. Additionally, the method for finding the target value in the recovered binary tree now works properly.
