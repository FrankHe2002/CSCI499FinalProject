There is a logic error in the current implementation of the `removeKdigits` function. The purpose of this function is to remove `k` digits while returning the smallest possible integer. The current implementation does not always produce the correct output.

To fix this issue, we will refactor the solution to ensure that it returns the correct result. In the updated implementation, instead of using a queue to store the digits and then converting them to a string, we will directly use a string to store the digits. Once we've created a new string following the removal of `k` digits, we'll handle cases where there are leading zeroes (including the case where there are multiple leading zeroes). Then, we'll extract the smallest number from those digits by using the `substring()` method from the StringBuilder class.

The fixed code will look as follows:
```java
// Runtime: 6 ms (Top 52.26%) | Memory: 38.9 MB (Top 67.58%)
class Solution {
    public String removeKdigits(String num, int k) {
        int n = num.length();
        if (n == k) {
            return "0";
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : num.toCharArray()) {
            while (k > 0 && sb.length() > 0 && sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) > ch) {
                sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
                k--;
            }
            if (sb.length() != 0 || ch != '0') {
                sb.append(ch);
            }
        }
        while (sb.length() != 0 && k > 0) {
            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
            k--;
        }
        return sb.length() == 0 ? "0" : sb.toString();
    }
}
```
