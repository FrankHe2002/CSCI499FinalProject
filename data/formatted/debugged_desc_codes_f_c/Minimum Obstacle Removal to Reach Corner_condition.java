The buggy Java code has multiple problems. The loop condition in the solve method is set incorrectly. There are also issues with the way the isValid method uses the Math.min function and with the if condition that checks if the current cell is the destination. Additionally, the solve method has logical issues that need to be addressed.

To fix the code, we need to:
- Fix the loop condition in the solve method and change the if condition that checks if the current cell is the destination.
- Amend the isValid method so that it checks both i and j using separate conditions.
- Correct the solve method logic to handle obstacle removal and updating the final result when the destination is reached.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    int[][] grid;
    int n, m;
    boolean[][] seen;
    int[] dx = new int[] {0, 0, 1, -1};
    int[] dy = new int[] {1, -1, 0, 0};
    int[][] dp;
    int finalres;

    private boolean isValid(int i, int j) {
        return i >= 0 && j >= 0 && i < n && j < m && !seen[i][j];
    }

    private int solve(int i, int j, int cnt) {
        if (i == n - 1 && j == m -1) {
            return cnt;
        }
        if (dp[i][j] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) return dp[i][j];
        seen[i][j] = true;
        int res = n * m + 1;
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
            int newI = i + dx[k], newJ = j + dy[k];
            if (isValid(newI, newJ)) {
                res = Math.min(res, solve(newI, newJ, cnt + (grid[i][j] == 1 ? 1 : 0)));
            }
        }
        seen[i][j] = false;
        return dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], res);
    }

    public int minimumObstacles(int[][] grid) {
        this.grid = grid;
        n = grid.length;
        m = grid[0].length;
        seen = new boolean[n][m];
        dp = new int[n][m];
        finalres = n * m + 1;
        for (int[] row : dp) Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        return solve(0, 0, 0);
    }
}
```
