The bug type in the provided is within the `maxConsecutive` function, is a logical error.
The loop updating the `max` value is calculating the consecutive floors without a special floor incorrectly. Specifically, the loop update `max = Math.max(max, special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1)` is not taking into account the difference between the last special floor and `top` in the condition.

The correct logic is to calculate the difference between the consecutive special floors and consider the space from the `bottom` floor to the first special floor and from the last special floor to the `top` floor.

To fix the logical error, adjust the loop so that it iterates up to the second-to-last special floor, ensuring to compare the difference between each pair of consecutive special floors and also consider the space from the `bottom` floor to the first special floor and from the last special floor to the `top` floor.

Fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxConsecutive(int bottom, int top, int[] special) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        Arrays.sort(special);

        // from bottom to the first special floor
        max = Math.max(max, special[0] - bottom - 1);

        // middle floors
        for (int i = 1; i < special.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1);
        }

        // from last special floor to the top
        max = Math.max(max, top - special[special.length - 1] - 1);

        return max;
    }
}
