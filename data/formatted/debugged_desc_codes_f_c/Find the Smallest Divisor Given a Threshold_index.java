Bug Type: Logical Error

The valid method in the provided code is implemented with a logical error. The method is supposed to determine whether using the given divisor, m, the resulting sum of the elements of the array after rounding is less than or equal to the threshold, h. However, the current implementation doesn't correctly evaluate the sum of the results of the array elements divided by m.

Additionally, there's an issue with initialization in the smallestDivisor function, as r is being incorrectly assigned as a[2], which may be out of bounds for some input arrays. It should be set to the maximum value within the array a.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestDivisor(int[] a, int h) {
        int l = 1, r = a[0];
        for (int x : a) if (x > r) r = x;

        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (valid(a, m, h)) r = m;
            else l = m + 1;
        }

        return l;
    }

    private boolean valid(int[] a, int m, int h) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int x : a) {
            sum += (x + m - 1) / m;
        }
        return sum <= h;
    }
}
```
