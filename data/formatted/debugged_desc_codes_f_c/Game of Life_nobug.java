The bug type in this fourth example is a logical error. The `nextState` method operates with neighbors wrt the current cell's index, and applies the game of life's rules accordingly. However, the method incorrectly checks the number of live neighbors for cells on the edge of the board. Specifically, the method does not handle the cases where counting live neighbors could exceed the board boundaries, potentially leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, we must correctly handle the cases where live neighbors reach the boundaries. We can address this by modifying how we calculate the number of live neighbors. The `nextState` method should be updated to correctly handle the boundary conditions and check for live neighbors considering all the cells within the board.

Below is the fixed version of the class:

```java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        int[][] next = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                next[i][j] = nextState(board, i, j, m, n);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                board[i][j] = next[i][j];
            }
        }
    }

    public int nextState(int[][] board, int i, int j, int m, int n) {
        int ones = 0;
        for (int x = - 1; x <= 1; x++) {
            for (int y = - 1; y <= 1; y++) {
                if (x == 0 && y == 0) {
                    continue;
                }
                int a = i + x, b = j + y;
                if (a >= 0 && a < m && b >= 0 && b < n) { // Check both row and column boundaries
                    ones += board[a][b];
                }
            }
        }
        if (board[i][j] == 0) {
            return ones == 3 ? 1 : 0;
        } else {
            if (ones == 2 || ones == 3) {
                return 1;
            } else {
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
