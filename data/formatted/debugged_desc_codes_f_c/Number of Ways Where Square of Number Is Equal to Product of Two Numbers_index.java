Buggy Code Explanation:
The original Java code contains multiple issues. While identifying these issues, the following rationale can be used:
1. Missing variable declaration
2. Invalid variable initialization inside nested loops
3. Use of invalid variable reference
4. Incorrect logical operations

The issues within the code are:
1. In the `numTriplets` method, the `count` method is called with the arguments (nums1, nums2) and (nums2, nums1). This is incorrect as it does not reflect the constraints of Type 1 and Type 2 triplets.
2. The `count` method:
    a. The variable `jNew` is used before it is declared.
    b. The initialization of the variable `x` is located after its use in the multiplication operation.
    c. The variable `jNew` is being referenced before it is declared, and in addition, the variable `j` is being used without declaration.
    d. The logical operation inside the nested loops and conditional blocks are not aligned with the expected computational behavior.

Fix:
The fixed code addresses all the identified issues. The main changes are:
1. Revise the logic within the `count` method to compute the number of triplets based on the Type 1 and Type 2 constraints.
2. Initialize the variables `jNew` and `x` at the appropriate positions.
3. Adjust the nested loop and conditional block to ensure accurate computation.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int numTriplets(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        return count(nums1, nums2) + count(nums2, nums1);
    }

    public int count(int[] a, int[] b) {
        Arrays.sort(a);
        Arrays.sort(b);

        int n = a.length;
        int m = b.length;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long val = (long) a[i] * a[i];
            int left = 0, right = m - 1;

            while (left < right) {
                long prod = (long) b[left] * b[right];

                if (prod < val) {
                    left++;
                } else if (prod > val) {
                    right--;
                } else {
                    if (b[left] != b[right]) {
                        int tempLeft = left;
                        int tempRight = right;

                        while (left < m && b[left] == b[tempLeft]) {
                            left++;
                        }
                        while (right >= 0 && b[right] == b[tempRight]) {
                            right--;
                        }
                        
                        count += (left - tempLeft) * (tempRight - right);
                    } else {
                        int length = right - left + 1;
                        count += length * (length - 1) / 2;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
