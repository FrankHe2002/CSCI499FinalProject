The bug in the provided code is in the logic for counting the minimum number of rabbits in the forest. The way the HashMap is being used to store and update the frequencies of answers is incorrect. The logic for updating the count is also flawed.

To fix this issue, the code can be modified to correctly store the frequencies of answers in the HashMap. Then, the count can be calculated based on the frequencies and group sizes.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int numRabbits(int[] answers) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int count = 0;

        for (int ele : answers) {
            if (!map.containsKey(ele)) {
                map.put(ele, 1);
                count += ele + 1;
            } else {
                int freq = map.get(ele);
                if (freq < ele + 1) {
                    map.put(ele, freq + 1);
                } else {
                    map.put(ele, 1);
                    count += ele + 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
