Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation: The logic in the while loop condition `while (curr == null)` is incorrect. The loop condition should check if curr is not null to ensure that the loop runs as long as there are nodes in the tree. Additionally, there is a missing pair of curly braces after the while loop.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.left != null) {
                TreeNode prev = curr.left;
                while (prev.right != null) {
                    prev = prev.right;
                }
                prev.right = curr.right;
                curr.right = curr.left;
                curr.left = null;
            }
            curr = curr.right;
        }
    }
}
```
