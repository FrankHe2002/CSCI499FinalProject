The bug type in the given code is a logical error.

The reasoning process to identify the bug type and fix the issue are as follows:

1. The error is a logical bug as the code fails to find the leftmost middle index in the array.
2. Upon reviewing the code, the most apparent problem lies in the logic for calculating the left and right sums to check for balance at each index. It's necessary to calculate the sums of left and right parts considering the whole array.
3. The code should iterate the array and calculate the total sum first, then update the left and right sums while looping through the array.
4. The return value should be appropriately updated.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMiddleIndex(int[] nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }

        int leftSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int rightSum = totalSum - leftSum - nums[i];
            if (leftSum == rightSum) {
                return i;
            }
            leftSum += nums[i];
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
