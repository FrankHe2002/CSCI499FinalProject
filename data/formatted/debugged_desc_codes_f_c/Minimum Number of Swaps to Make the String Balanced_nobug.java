The problem in the provided code lies in the unnecessary complexity of the solution. The minimum number of swaps to make the input string balanced is not computed as a separate distinct step but is hidden within the algorithm's stack unwinding part. Hence, it's difficult to identify exactly how the solution works.

Next, the bug has been identified as an incorrect approach for minimizing the required swaps, leading to an incorrect output. To fix the code, the calculation for the minimum number of swaps should be re-evaluated and separated from stack manipulation.

Below is the fixed code in markdown:

```java
// Runtime: 414 ms (Top 6.65%) | Memory: 100.2 MB (Top 5.02%)
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        int imbalance = 0, swaps = 0;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '[') {
                imbalance++;
            } else {
                if (imbalance > 0) {
                    imbalance--;
                } else {
                    swaps++;
                }
            }
        }
        return swaps;
    }
}
```
