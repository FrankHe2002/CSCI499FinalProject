The bug is found in the for loop's condition, which should be n != 0 instead of n == 0. Also, the right shift operation should be n >>= 1, which is equivalent to n = n >> 1.
Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        int inv = 0;
        for (; n != 0; n >>= 1) {
            inv ^= n;
            System.out.println(inv + " " + n);
        }
        return inv;
    }
}
```
