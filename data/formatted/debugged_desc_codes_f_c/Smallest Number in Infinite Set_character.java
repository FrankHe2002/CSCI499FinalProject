The bug in this code is related to multiple reasons:

1. The `popSmallest` method has a missing closing curly brace (`}`) for the if statement, leading to a syntax error. Additionally, the method incorrectly increments the index when the priority queue is empty, which violates the requirement of the infinite set containing all positive integers without gaps.

2. The `is_in_q` method uses a linear search to check if a number is in the priority queue, which is inefficient and unnecessary. The proper method to check for containment in a priority queue is to use the `contains` method directly.

Below is the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class SmallestInfiniteSet {
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> q;
    private int index;

    public SmallestInfiniteSet() {
        q = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
        index = 1;
    }

    public int popSmallest() {
        if (!q.isEmpty()) {
            return q.poll();
        }
        return index++;
    }

    public void addBack(int num) {
        if (num < index && !q.contains(num)) {
            q.add(num);
        }
    }
}
```
