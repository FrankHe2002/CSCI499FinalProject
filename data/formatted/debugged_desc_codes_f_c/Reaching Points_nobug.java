The bug in this code is potentially caused by the way recursion is called, and the implementation might lead to a stack overflow error due to non-optimized recursion. The recursion should be terminated if either tx or ty is smaller than the starting point's coordinates. Also, there needs to be a check to ensure that sx or sy are not greater than tx or ty respectively, which breaks the pattern of x and y. 

The fix will include adding these conditions and rearranging the recursive calls to optimize performance and to prevent a stack overflow error. 

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 55.54%) | Memory: 41.4 MB (Top 26.41%)
class Solution {
    public boolean reachingPoints(int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty) {
        if (sx > tx || sy > ty) {
            return false;
        }
        if (sx == tx && sy == ty) {
            return true;
        }
        return tx < ty ?
                reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty - tx*(ty / tx))
                : reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx - ty*(tx/ty), ty);
    }
}
```
