Incorrect functions are used to solve the problem. The digitSum function is meant to divide the string s into groups, then replace the groups with the sum of their digits, and repeat if the length of the modified string s is greater than k. To fix this, we need to replace the method calls used to solve the problem.

Fix:
The first while loop used to repeat the process should be changed to use the string gen until the length of the modified string is no longer greater than k. Additionally, the gen method should take into account the more complex requirements.

```java
// Runtime: 6 ms (Top 32.40%) | Memory: 40.8 MB (Top 89.31%)
class Solution {
    public String digitSum(String s, int k) {
        while (s.length() > k) s = gen(s, k);
        return s;
    }

    public String gen(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ) {
            int count = 0, num = 0;
            while (i < s.length() && count++ < k) num += Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt(i++));
            res.append(num);
        }
        return res.toString();
    }
}
```
