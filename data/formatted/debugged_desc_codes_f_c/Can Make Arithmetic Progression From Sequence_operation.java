The bug in the given Java code is that it always returns true when the input array is empty, regardless of whether the input array can form an arithmetic progression or not. This is due to the incorrect conditional logic in the code.

Explanation:
The condition `if (arr.length < 1)` should be `if (arr.length < 2)` to check whether the length of the input array is less than 2, as an arithmetic progression must consist of at least three elements to have a common difference.

Another issue to consider is that sorting the  input array could change the order of the elements, which should not be done because the problem statement mentions rearranging elements instead of sorting them.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public boolean canMakeArithmeticProgression(int[] arr) {
        if (arr.length < 2)
            return false;

        int diff = arr[1] - arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i + 1] - arr[i] != diff) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
