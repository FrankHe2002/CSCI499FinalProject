The bug in the code is within the countLatticePoints method. There are several issues such as attempting to access an index out of the array's bounds while iterating through the circles array of integers. Let's analyze and fix the bug.

1. The code attempts to access index 4 from the circles array using `int r = c[4];`. The correct index to access radius should be `int r = c[2];` since index starts from 0.
2. The condition to calculate lattice points checks the radius by doing `(r * r) >= ((x - xx) * (x - xx)) + ((y - yy) * (y - yy))`, which is incorrect. There is a missing check, i.e `(r * r) >= (x - xx) * (x - xx) + (y - yy) * (y - yy)`. Also, we need to check if the distance from the circle's center to the point is less than or equal to the radius.
3. Change `if ((r * r) >= ((x - xx) * (x - xx)) + ((y - yy) * (y - yy)))` to  `if ((r * r) >= (x - xx) * (x - xx) + (y - yy) * (y - yy))`.

The following is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int countLatticePoints(int[][] circles) {
        Set<String> answer = new HashSet<String>();

        for (int[] c : circles) {
            int x = c[0], y = c[1], r = c[2];

            // traversing over all the points that lie inside the smallest square capable of containing the whole circle
            for (int xx = x - r; xx <= x + r; xx++) {
                for (int yy = y - r; yy <= y + r; yy++) {
                    if ((r * r) >= (x - xx) * (x - xx) + (y - yy) * (y - yy)) {
                        answer.add(xx + ":" + yy);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return answer.size();
    }
}
```
