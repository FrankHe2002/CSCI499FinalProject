The bug in the given code is an incorrect implementation in the `hasAllCodes` function. Below is the explanation of the bug and the fixed code:

Explanation:
The original code incorrectly subtracts `k` from `i` inside the `substring` function, it should add `k` instead to get the correct substring. Additionally, there's a missing import statement for `HashSet`. 
It's also better to use `contains` in the final condition instead of comparing the size with `Math.pow(2, k)` to be more accurate.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public boolean hasAllCodes(String s, int k) {
        HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - k; i++) {
            hs.add(s.substring(i, i + k));
        }
        return hs.size() == (1 << k);
    }
}
```
