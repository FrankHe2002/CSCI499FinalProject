The bug in the code is the incorrect curly brace placement. The inner `if` statements are not correctly enclosed due to missing curly braces, leading to incorrect conditional checks and assignment of `dup` and `miss`. Additionally, there is a missing closing curly brace for the outer for loop.

The code can be fixed by enclosing the assignment statements in the inner for loop within curly braces and adding a closing curly brace for the outer for loop.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int dup = 0, miss = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == i) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count == 2) {
                dup = i;
            }
            if (count == 0) {
                miss = i;
            }
        }
        return new int[] {dup, miss};
    }
}
```
