The bug in the provided Java code is in the `flipLights` function, where the computation of different possible status after performing all button presses has some logical errors. 

The original if block logic returns some fixed values based on n and presses, which does not satisfy all the possible different statuses. Also, the comments inside the function need improvement for better readability and understanding.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int flipLights(int n, int presses) {
        if (n == 2) {
            if (presses == 0) return 1; // all lights are off
            if (presses == 1) return 3; // button 1 flips the status to all on, then button 2 or 3 can be used
            if (presses == 2) return 4; // button 4 can be used to toggle and get all light on
        } else {
            if (presses == 0) return 1; // all lights are on
            if (presses == 1) return 4; // buttons 1, 2, 3 changes 4 different patterns
            if (presses == 2) return 7; // with 2 presses, 7 patterns can be achieved
            if (presses >= 3) return 8; // after 3 or more presses, it results in a constant pattern
        }
        return 1;
    }
}
```
