Bug Type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
The code is incorrectly checking if a character is weak. Instead, it should be checking if there exists another character that is stronger.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfWeakCharacters(int[][] properties) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int[] character : properties) {
            for (int[] other : properties) {
                if (other[0] > character[0] && other[1] > character[1]) {
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
