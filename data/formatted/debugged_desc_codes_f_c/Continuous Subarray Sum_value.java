The given buggy Java code aims to solve the problem of checking if an input array has a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of k.

The provided code has multiple faults, such as the use of an array with dynamic programming that contains incorrect logic and relies on a help function that is not necessary. The helper function uses cumulative sum comparison, which is not required to solve the subarray problem.

I will re-implement the function using an efficient approach.

Updated/Fixed code can be shown as below:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> h = new HashMap<>();
        h.put(0, - 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            if (k != 0)
                sum = sum % k;
            if (h.containsKey(sum)) {
                if (i - h.get(sum) >= 2) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            else {
                h.put(sum, i);
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

The modified code achieves the intended functionality. I replaced the inefficient logic, removed the call to the helper function, and used an additional HashMap for better performance without using an extra boolean array.
