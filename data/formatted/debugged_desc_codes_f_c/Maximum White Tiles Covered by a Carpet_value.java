The bug in the given Java code is a logical error, making it return incorrect results. The calculation for maxCount is inaccurate. 

The logical error ranges from improper index usage to miscalculated expressions. Some of the mistakes in the code:
- Using [-1] for array indexing instead of [0] and [1].
- Inconsistencies in variable naming and usage. 
- Overcomplicated logic and expressions leading to code complexity.

To fix this, the code needs to be corrected to align with the requirements of the problem.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 45 ms (Top 71.1%) | Memory: 71.05 MB (Top 47.1%)

import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maximumWhiteTiles(int[][] tiles, int carpetLen) {
        Arrays.sort(tiles, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        long maxCount = 0;
        long count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tiles.length; i++) {
            int start = tiles[i][0];
            int end = tiles[i][1];
            if (end - start + 1 <= carpetLen) {
                count += end - start + 1;
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
            } else {
                long diff = end - start + 1;
                long initial = start + carpetLen - 1;
                if (initial <= end) {
                    maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, carpetLen);
                }
                count -= diff;
            }
        }
        return (int) maxCount;
    }
}
