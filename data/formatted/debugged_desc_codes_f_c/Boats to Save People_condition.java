Bug Type:
The bug type is a logical error. The while loop condition `while (left > right)` is incorrect and will cause the loop not to run because the condition will never be true.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 24 ms (Top 38.47%) | Memory: 65.6 MB (Top 33.01%)
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        int boatCount = 0;
        Arrays.sort(people);

        int left = 0;
        int right = people.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int sum = people[left] + people[right];
            if (sum <= limit) {
                boatCount++;
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                boatCount++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return boatCount;
    }
}
```
