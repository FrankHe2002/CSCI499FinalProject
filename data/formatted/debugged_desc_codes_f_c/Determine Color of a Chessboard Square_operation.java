Explanation:
The `squareIsWhite` method calculates the color of the chessboard square based on its coordinates. However, the original code contains a mistake. The arithmetic operation should be enclosed in parentheses to ensure correct evaluation of the mathematical expression. Additionally, the '0' should be enclosed in single quotes to indicate that it is a character.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean squareIsWhite(String coordinates) {
        return ((coordinates.charAt(0) - 'a') / (coordinates.charAt(1) - '0')) % 2 != 0;
    }
}
```
