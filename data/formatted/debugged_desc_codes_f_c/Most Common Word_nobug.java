The bug in the given Java code is that the logic for removing banned words from the frequency map `hm` is incorrect. It simply removes the banned words using `hm.remove(banned[i])`. However, this doesn't take into account that after removing a forbidden word, the index of other elements in the HashMap changes.

The fix is to first create a HashSet of the banned words for faster lookup, and then use this to ensure constant time complexity when checking and removing those words from the HashMap.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {

        HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        Set<String> bannedSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(banned));
        String[] words = paragraph.replaceAll("[!?',;.]", " ").toLowerCase().split("\\s+");
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (!bannedSet.contains(words[i]))
                hm.put(words[i], hm.getOrDefault(words[i], 0) + 1);
        }

        return Collections.max(hm.entrySet(), Map.Entry.comparingByValue()).getKey();
    }
}
```
