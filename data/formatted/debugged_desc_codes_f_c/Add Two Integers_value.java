The bug in the provided code is a logical error in the sum function. The code provided attempts to find the sum of two numbers using an unnecessary binary search, which is incorrect. The fix is to simply return the sum of the two numbers without any additional processing.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sum(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```
