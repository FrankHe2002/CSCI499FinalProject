The bug type in the code for the countGoodRectangles function is a logical error.

The reasoning process to identify the bug starts by understanding the logic for finding the side length of the largest square. We need to compare the length of each rectangle and update the maximum length found so far. However, the code incorrectly compares these and updates the maximum side length in a loop. Additionally, the second loop simply counts the maximum side length, which is not the intended logic.

To fix this, we will compare both dimensions and only keep track of counts for the maximum side length without using a separate list. We will also fix the algorithm to find the largest side length and count the number of rectangles with that length.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countGoodRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
        int maxLen = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rectangles.length; i++) {
            int minSide = Math.min(rectangles[i][0], rectangles[i][1]);
            if (minSide > maxLen) {
                maxLen = minSide;
                count = 1;
            } else if (minSide == maxLen) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
