Bug type: Syntax error, logical error

The provided buggy Java code has two types of bugs:

1. The variable `road[ms]` in the for-loop should be `road[0]`. It is a syntax error causing the code to malfunction when trying to access the first index of the `road` array.

2. The calculation of the maximum total importance is incorrect. Sorting the degree array in ascending order does not correctly account for the importance of each road.

Applying the identified fixes:

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

// Runtime: 28 ms (Top 55.58%) | Memory: 124.3 MB (Top 45.11%)
class Solution {
    public long maximumImportance(int n, int[][] roads) {
        long ans = 0, x = 1;
        long degree[] = new long[n];
        for (int road[] : roads) {
            degree[road[0]]++;
            degree[road[1]]++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(degree);
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans += degree[i] * x;
            x++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
