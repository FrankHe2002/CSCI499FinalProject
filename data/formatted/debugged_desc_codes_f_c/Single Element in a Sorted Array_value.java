The bug in the code is in the condition `if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) mid = mid - 1;`. This condition incorrectly decrements `mid` when two same elements are found, which does not follow the expected logic. The condition should directly change the range of the search instead.

Additionally, the check for the length of the left half and the corresponding adjustments to the pointers are also incomplete.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int h = nums.length - 1;

        while (l < h) {
            int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;

            if (mid % 2 == 1) {
                mid--;  // the element is on the left of mid
            }

            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) {
                l = mid + 2; // the left half doesn't change and adjust the right half
            } else {
                h = mid;    // the right half doesn't change and adjust the left half
            }
        }

        return nums[l];
    }
}
```

The corrected fixed code initiates the search and checks the rightmost bit of the mid index to determine which side of the mid index the unique number is located. Then, it correctly adjusts the range based on the comparison of elements at the mid index and mid+1 index.
