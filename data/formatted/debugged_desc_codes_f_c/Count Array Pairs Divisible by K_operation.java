The bug in the provided Java code is in the gcd function. The while loop inside the gcd function should have the condition n2 != 0 instead of n1 - n2 != 0. This is because the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers should end when the remainder becomes zero after dividing n1 by n2.

Additionally, the comment in the code suggests an alternative approach using gcd, which is incorrect. The alternative condition should be used, and the code should be adjusted accordingly.

Lastly, the method is required to return the total number of pairs, so the data type of the answer variable must be changed from long to int in order to fit the constraints.

The fixed Java code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        for (int val : nums) {
            int gcd1 = gcd(val, k);
            int gcd2 = k / gcd1;

            ans += hm.getOrDefault(gcd2, 0);

            hm.put(gcd1, hm.getOrDefault(gcd1, 0) + 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }

    //function to calculate gcd

    public int gcd(int n1, int n2) {
        while (n2 != 0) {
            int rem = n1 % n2;
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = rem;
        }
        return n1;
    }
}
```
