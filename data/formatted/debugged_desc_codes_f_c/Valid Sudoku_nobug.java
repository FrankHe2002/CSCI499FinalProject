Explanation:
The original code has a logical bug in checking if the current value exists in the set. The bug results in rows, columns, and sub-boxes not being checked accurately for the presence of duplicate values, thereby potentially returning false positive or false negative results. There are also syntax issues regarding the current implementation of the set seen. To fix these problems, we need to check if the same value has already been added for a specific row, column, and sub-grid. To achieve this, we can create unique identifiers for each cell and add them to the set. After that, we need to adjust the condition statements to ensure that all the checks are valid for recognizing duplicate values in the board.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        HashSet<String> seen = new HashSet<>();

        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                char currentVal = board[i][j];
                if(currentVal != '.') {
                    if(!(seen.add(currentVal + " found in row " + i)) ||
                            !(seen.add(currentVal + " found in column " + j)) ||
                            !(seen.add(currentVal + " found in sub box " + i/3 + "-" + j/3))) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
