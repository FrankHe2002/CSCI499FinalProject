The bug in the given Java code is that the logic to check and find pairs is incorrect. The set should be used to check for the presence of a matching pair, but the code incorrectly removes the element from the set if a pair is found. This approach is incorrect. Additionally, the constraint is that we should remove the matched pair from the array `nums`, not from the `HashSet`.

Another minor issue is that there is no need to check if `nums.length == 1` before processing the array, because the logic inside the loop can handle input arrays of length 1.

The fixed code will correctly use the `nums` array to check for matching pairs and update the count of pairs and the number of leftover integers accordingly.

Fix:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public int[] numberOfPairs(int[] nums) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int pairs = 0;

        for (int i : nums) {
            if (set.contains(i)) {
                set.remove(i);
                pairs++;
            } else {
                set.add(i);
            }
        }

        return new int[] {pairs, nums.length - 2 * pairs};
    }
}
```
The above code correctly uses the HashSet to check for the presence of matching pairs and then updates the count of pairs and the number of leftover integers based on the matching pairs found. The unnecessary check for `nums.length == 1` has been removed as well since the loop logic can handle input arrays of any length.
