Explanation:
The original code contains multiple issues. The identifier `HashMap` used inside the loop is incorrectly used without the `seen` map object. Additionally, the computation of `diff` is incorrect, and the usage of the `i - nums[HashMap]` expression for the difference is not proper. There's also a logical mistake where the `count` should be incremented by `nums[j] - nums[i]` instead of `i - seen.get(diff)`.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public long countBadPairs(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        long count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int diff = nums[i] - i;
            if (seen.containsKey(diff)) {
                count += (nums[i] - nums[seen.get(diff)]);
            } else {
                count += i;
            }
            seen.put(diff, seen.getOrDefault(diff, 0) + 1);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
