The bug occurs in the `stoneGame` method. The mistake appears to be in the calculation of the scores where the variable `score` does not need to accumulate individual pile scores as it is causing the incorrect evaluation. Additionally, there are errors in the indexing when accessing the piles array. There also seems to be a logical error in the memoization helper and the calculation of the score. 

The issue can be resolved by changing the way the score is calculated and the way piles array is accessed, as well as by correcting the memoization process and the conditional statement within the function.

Below is the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int stoneGameII(int[] piles) {
        Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
        int diff = stoneGame(piles, 1, 0, 0, memo);
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int ele : piles)
            totalSum += ele;
        return (diff + totalSum) / 2;
    }

    public int stoneGame(int[] piles, int M, int index, int turn, Map<String, Integer> memo) {
        if (index >= piles.length)
            return 0;
        if (memo.containsKey(index + "-" + M + "-" + turn))
            return memo.get(index + "-" + M + "-" + turn);
        int maxScore = (turn == 0) ? Integer.MIN_VALUE : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int score = 0;
        for (int X = 1; X <= 2 * M && index + X <= piles.length; X++) {
            score += piles[index + X - 1];
            int nextM = Math.max(M, X);
            int nextIndex = index + X;
            int nextTurn = 1 - turn;
            int nextScore = stoneGame(piles, nextM, nextIndex, nextTurn, memo);
            if (turn == 0) {
                maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, score + nextScore);
            } else {
                maxScore = Math.min(maxScore, nextScore - score);
            }
        }
        memo.put(index + "-" + M + "-" + turn, maxScore);
        return maxScore;
    }
}
```
