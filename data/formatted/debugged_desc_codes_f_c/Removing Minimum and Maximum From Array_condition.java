The bug identified in the provided Java code is a logical error in the logic for finding the smallest number of deletions in the array. The approach for finding the minimum number of deletions to remove the minimum and maximum elements is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for finding the minimum number of deletions by considering the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculating the number of deletions needed based on their relative positions.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // Find the indices of the maximum and minimum elements
        int minIndex = 0, maxIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[maxIndex]) {
                maxIndex = i;
            }
            if (nums[i] < nums[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = i;
            }
        }

        // Calculate the minimum number of deletions based on the relative positions of the min and max elements
        int deletions = Math.min(maxIndex, n - minIndex - 1) + Math.min(minIndex, n - maxIndex - 1);
        
        return deletions;
    }
}
```

The fixed logic for finding the minimum number of deletions now accurately considers the relative positions of the minimum and maximum elements when calculating the required number of deletions.
