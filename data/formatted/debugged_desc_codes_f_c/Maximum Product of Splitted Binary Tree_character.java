There are multiple bugs in the given Java code:
1. The method `findMaxSum` does not correctly calculate the sum of the nodes in the tree.
2. The method `findProd` does not correctly calculate the product of the subtree sums.
3. There is a missing closing parenthesis in the return statement of the `maxProduct` method.

Fixing the bugs:
1. In the `findMaxSum` method, the sum of the nodes in the tree should be properly calculated by updating the values in the `sum` array, which should be passed by reference to store the sum.

2. In the `findProd` method, the product of the subtree sums should be calculated correctly. The logic to compute `val` is incorrect. It should calculate the sum of the left and right subtrees plus the current node's value. The max product should be calculated based on this `val`.

3. The missing closing parenthesis in the return statement of the `maxProduct` method needs to be added to make the code syntax correct.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 12 ms (Top 82.12%) | Memory: 70.1 MB (Top 38.32%)
class Solution {
    public long findMaxSum(TreeNode node, long[] sum) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        long left = findMaxSum(node.left, sum);
        long right = findMaxSum(node.right, sum);

        sum[0] += node.val + left + right;
        
        return node.val + left + right;
    }

    public long findProd(TreeNode node, long sum, long[] max) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        long left = findProd(node.left, sum, max);
        long right = findProd(node.right, sum, max);

        long val = node.val + left + right;
        max[0] = Math.max(max[0], val * (sum - val));

        return val;
    }

    public int maxProduct(TreeNode root) {
        long max[] = new long[1];
        long sum[] = new long[1];

        findMaxSum(root, sum);
        
        findProd(root, sum[0], max);

        return (int) (max[0] % ((int) 1e9 + 7));
    }
}
```
