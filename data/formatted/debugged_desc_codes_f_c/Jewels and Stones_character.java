The bug in the provided Java code is a syntax error in the second for loop of the `numJewelsInStones` method. It is missing parentheses in the loop condition. 

To fix the issue, the missing parentheses need to be added to the for loop's condition in the second for loop.

Here's the fixed code: 
```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        HashSet<Character> hs = new HashSet<>();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < jewels.length(); i++) {
            hs.add(jewels.charAt(i));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < stones.length(); i++) {
            if (hs.contains(stones.charAt(i)))
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
