The bug in the provided Java code is that there are missing brackets for the `circularPermutation` method, which causes syntax errors and doesn't return the correct result.

Also, the code provided does not arrange the elements in a circular permutation form as required by the prompt, i.e., p[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation and p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.

The implementation is missing the steps required to generate a circular permutation.

To fix the bugs:

1. Add the brackets to the `circularPermutation` method.
2. Generate and return the circular permutations as specified by the problem.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Generate Gray code sequence
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            result.add(i ^ (i / 2));
        }
        
        // Find the index of start
        int index = 0;
        while (result.get(index) != start) {
            index++;
        }
        
        // Reorder the list to start with 'start'
        List<Integer> subList1 = result.subList(index, result.size());
        List<Integer> subList2 = result.subList(0, index);
        result.clear();

        result.addAll(subList1);
        result.addAll(subList2);
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the `circularPermutation` method correctly generates a list of integers in circular permutation order, following Gray code sequencing.
