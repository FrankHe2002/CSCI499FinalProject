The identified bug type in the provided Java code is for the `numWays` function. The code has an incorrect use of memory management, leading to performance and memory consumption issues.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug involves understanding the memory overhead caused by excessive usage of the HashMap and optimizing the recursive function to eliminate redundancy.

The bug in the provided code results from the excessive memory usage to store the computed results in a HashMap and the inefficient recursive function that results in redundant calculations. This leads to performance and memory issues. By optimizing the recursive function and eliminating redundant computations, the memory and performance issues can be resolved with a more efficient algorithm.

The fixed code has been updated to optimize the recursive function and eliminate memory overhead by removing the unnecessary HashMap. The fixed code is as below:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWays(int steps, int arrLen) {
        int maxPos = Math.min(steps / 2, arrLen - 1);
        int MOD = 1000000007;

        int[][] dp = new int[2][maxPos + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= steps; i++) {
            int curr = i % 2, prev = (i - 1) % 2;
            for (int j = 0; j <= maxPos; j++) {
                dp[curr][j] = dp[prev][j];
                if (j > 0) {
                    dp[curr][j] = (dp[curr][j] + dp[prev][j - 1]) % MOD;
                }
                if (j < maxPos) {
                    dp[curr][j] = (dp[curr][j] + dp[prev][j + 1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[steps % 2][0];
    }
}
```
