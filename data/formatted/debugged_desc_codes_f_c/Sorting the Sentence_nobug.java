The bug in the original code is that the sentence is being reordered using an incorrect technique, resulting in an incorrect output. The fix is to properly reorder the sentence based on the appended 1-indexed word position. Another issue is the unnecessary use of a new string array.

The fixed code is:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 59.85%) | Memory: 42 MB (Top 63.26%)
class Solution {
    public String sortSentence(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        String[] result = new String[words.length];
        for (String word : words) {
            int position = Character.getNumericValue(word.charAt(word.length() - 1));
            result[position - 1] = word.substring(0, word.length() - 1);
        }
        return String.join(" ", result);
    }
}
```
