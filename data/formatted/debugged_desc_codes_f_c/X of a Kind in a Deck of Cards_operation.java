Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation: 
The "gcd" method in the `hasGroupsSizeX` function has a logical error in its recursive call. The method's purpose is to find the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm, where the classic implementation is to call `gcd(b, a % b)`. However, the method has incorrectly implemented `a * b` within the recursive call.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasGroupsSizeX(int[] deck) {
        int[] count = new int[10000];
        for (int i : deck)
            count[i]++;
        int gcd = 0;
        for (int i : count)
            if (i != 0)
                gcd = gcd == 0 ? i : gcd(gcd, i);
        return gcd >= 2;
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```
