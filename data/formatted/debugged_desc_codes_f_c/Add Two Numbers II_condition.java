The bug in the provided code is in the addTwoNumbers method in the Solution class. The issue arises when summing the values from the input linked lists, fetching the values of l1 and l2 before checking if they are null. This will lead to a NullPointerException when the end of any list is reached.

Additionally, the reverseLinkedList method has a minor issue as the while loop needs to be updated in order to reference the variable head, and the return statement should return prev and not head.

These issues should be resolved to ensure the intended functionality of the addTwoNumbers method, as well as correct the reverseLinkedList method.

Below is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode res = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode curr = res;
        l1 = reverseLinkedList(l1);
        l2 = reverseLinkedList(l2);
        int carry = 0;
        while (l1 != null || l2 != null || carry == 1) {
            int sum = carry; // Initialize sum with carry
            if (l1 != null) {
                sum += l1.val;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            if (l2 != null) {
                sum += l2.val;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            carry = sum / 10;
            curr.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return reverseLinkedList(res.next);
    }

    public ListNode reverseLinkedList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null, curr = head, next;
        while (curr != null) {
            next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```
