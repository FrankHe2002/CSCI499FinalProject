Bug Type: Logical error and logical error

1. The first logical error stems from the condition `a >= nums.length` in the `moveZeroes` method. It should be `a < nums.length` since we want the loop to run while `a` is less than the length of `nums`.
2. There is a logical error inside the `while` loop. The condition `if (nums[a] != 0)` should be `if (nums[a] == 0)`. This is because we want to move zeros to the end, so when the current number is zero (`nums[a] == 0`), we should swap it with a non-zero number.

To fix this, the code should be modified as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int a = 0, z = 0, temp;
        while (a < nums.length) {
            if (nums[a] != 0) {
                temp = nums[z];
                nums[z] = nums[a];
                nums[a] = temp;
                z += 1;
            }
            a += 1;
        }
    }
}
```
