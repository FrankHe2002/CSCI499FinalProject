Explanation:
The issue with the provided code is that the sum for each word is incorrectly calculated due to the multiplication by 10 inside the loop. This results in incorrect numerical values for each word, potentially leading to incorrect comparison in the return statement.

Fix:
The multiplication by 10 should be performed after the inner loop completes for each word. This can be done by moving the multiplication outside of the loop and replacing the addition assignment operator (`+=`) with multiplication assignment operator (`*=`). 

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSumEqual(String firstWord, String secondWord, String targetWord) {
        int sumfirst = 0, sumsecond = 0, sumtarget = 0;
        for (char c : firstWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumfirst = sumfirst * 10 + (c - 'a');
        }
        for (char c : secondWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumsecond = sumsecond * 10 + (c - 'a');
        }
        for (char c : targetWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumtarget = sumtarget * 10 + (c - 'a');
        }

        return (sumfirst + sumsecond) == sumtarget;
    }
}
```
