The bug in the provided Java code is a logical error in the for-loops used to calculate the prefix count of 1 cells on the bottom and right directions. The loop conditions and comparison operators within these loops are incorrect, resulting in incorrect results.

The logical error in the for-loop conditions and the comparison operators used for the prefix count of 1 cells on the bottom and right directions can be identified through debugging or carefully analyzing the algorithm's intended behavior and implementation.

To fix this logical error, the following changes need to be made with minimal changes to the existing code:
1. Update the check for the index boundary in the top and bottom direction in the second for-loop to check if `i + 1` is less than `arr.length`, rather than `i * 1 < arr.length`.
2. Update the check for the index boundary in the right direction in the second for-loop to check if `j + 1` is less than `arr.length`, rather than `j * 1 < arr.length`.

Here's the fixed Java code with the logical error corrected:

```java
// Runtime: 80 ms (Top 59.69%) | Memory: 74.3 MB (Top 37.60%)
class Solution {
    public int orderOfLargestPlusSign(int n, int[][] mines) {
        // ... (rest of the unchanged code)

        // Prefix count of 1 cells on bottom and right directions
        for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = arr.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (i + 1 < arr.length && arr[i + 1][j] == 1) {
                    dpBottom[i][j] = 1 + dpBottom[i + 1][j];
                }

                if (j + 1 < arr.length && arr[i][j + 1] == 1) {
                    dpRight[i][j] = 1 + dpRight[i][j + 1];
                }
            }
        }

        // ... (rest of the unchanged code)
    }
}
```
