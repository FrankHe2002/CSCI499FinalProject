The bug in the provided code is in the `removeDuplicates` method. The while loop condition is incorrect as the intention is to iterate until `i` is less than `newString.length()`, but the current condition `i >= newString.length()` is causing the loop to never execute. 

Additionally, the `count` array should be initiated with size `s.length()` instead of `newString.length()`, since `newString` is based on `s` itself which may have duplicate removals. 

Another issue is that the loop condition `i>= newString.length()` should be `i < newString.length()`. Initially, the count array should have a value of -1 for the condition `i == 0` to rectify the first index count. Also, the deleting operation should set the count of the last character; it should be `count[i-k] = 0`.

Below is the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
// Runtime: 71 ms (Top 53.30%) | Memory: 48.3 MB (Top 81.34%)
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        StringBuilder newString = new StringBuilder(s);
        int[] count = new int[s.length()];

        while (i < newString.length()) {
            if (i == 0 || newString.charAt(i) != newString.charAt(i - 1)) {
                count[i] = 1;
            } else {
                count[i] = count[i - 1] + 1;
                if (count[i] == k) {
                    newString.delete(i - k + 1, i + 1);
                    i = i - k;
                    if (i - k >= 0) {
                        count[i-k] = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
            i++;
        }
        return newString.toString();
    }
}
```
