The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The logical error occurs in the missingRolls method. It has an incorrect implementation of calculating the number of missing rolls given the average value and number of missing rolls. Additionally, the condition checking for valid input values is using incorrect logic.

The fix involves recalculating the number of missing rolls based on the average value and the sum of existing rolls. 

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] missingRolls(int[] rolls, int mean, int n) {
        int m = rolls.length;
        int sum = Arrays.stream(rolls).sum();
        int remainder = (m + n) * mean - sum;

        if (n < 1 || n > 105 || mean < 1 || mean > 6 || remainder < n || remainder > 6 * n) {
            return new int[] {};
        }

        int[] result = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int value = Math.min(remainder, 6);
            result[i] = value;
            remainder -= value;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
