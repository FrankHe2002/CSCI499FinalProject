The bug type in the provided Java code is Logical (calculation) error. The function `digArtifacts` is not properly checking whether an artifact is fully excavated before counting it as extracted.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug involves checking the algorithm and understanding the logic. The original code loops through each artifact and checks if each cell, represented in the `artifacts` array, is in the `dig` set (indicating an excavation). If any of the cells are not excavated, the artifact is not counted.

However, the incorrect part is the check for the entire artifact being excavated. For each artifact, the code should check if all cells within the artifact are excavated before counting it as fully extracted.

Additionally, the algorithm should not break prematurely if some of the artifact cells are excavated but others are not. It should correctly iterate through all cells of each artifact to make the full determination.

Furthermore, it's essential to replace the HashSet `set` with a 2D boolean array that represents the grid and marks the excavated cells to more efficiently check if a cell is excavated.

Also, appropriate comments should be added to enhance code readability and better describe the purpose of certain code blocks.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 198 ms (Top 10.48%) | Memory: 160.5 MB (Top 2.16%)
class Solution {
    public int digArtifacts(int n, int[][] artifacts, int[][] dig) {
        // Create a boolean grid representing the excavation
        boolean[][] isExcavated = new boolean[n][n];
        // Mark cells excavated by iterating through dig array
        for (int[] d : dig) {
            isExcavated[d[0]][d[1]] = true;
        }
        // Count of extracted artifacts
        int c = 0;
        // Check each artifact for full excavation
        for (int[] a : artifacts) {
            boolean done = true;
            for (int i = a[0]; i <= a[2]; i++) {
                for (int j = a[1]; j <= a[3]; j++) {
                    if (!isExcavated[i][j]) {
                        done = false;
                        break; // Not fully excavated, move to the next artifact
                    }
                }
            }
            if (done) {
                c++; // Artifact fully excavated
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
}
//TC = O(N^2) where N is the dimension of 2D grid
```

The fixed code addresses the logical error and improves the efficiency of checking for fully excavated artifacts. The corrected arrays and improved comments enhance readability and maintain a more accurate representation of the problem's requirements.
