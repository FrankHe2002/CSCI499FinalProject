Explanation:
The given code calculates the total number of lines required to write the string `s` across lines no longer than 100 pixels. However, the count of lines and the width of the last line are not calculated correctly. Additionally, the array size is mistakenly declared as `int[] arr = new int[4];` instead of `int[] arr = new int[2];`.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 73.53%) | Memory: 41.8 MB (Top 76.89%)
class Solution {
    public int[] numberOfLines(int[] widths, String s) {
        int lines = 1, width = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
            int pos = s.charAt(j) - 'a';
            width += widths[pos];
            if (width > 100) {
                lines++;
                width = widths[pos];
            }
        }
        return new int[]{lines, width};
    }
}
```
