Explanation:
- There are two major issues in the code shared. When initializing the boolean array "inStack", there's a mistake in the input value type and assigning the "Character" as an input for an array.
- Another issue is that the import statement for the 'ArrayDeque' and 'Deque' classes is missing.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String smallestSubsequence(String s) {
        boolean[] inStack = new boolean[26];
        int[] lastIdx = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(lastIdx, -1);
        // rest of the code is unchanged
```
