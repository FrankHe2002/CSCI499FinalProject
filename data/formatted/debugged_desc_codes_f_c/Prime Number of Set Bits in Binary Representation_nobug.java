The bug type in the provided code is logical error and syntax error.

The first logical error is in the `calculateSetBits` method. The method is supposed to calculate the number of set bits in a given binary string, but it is not actually considering binary strings. The fix is to directly work with binary representation using bitwise operations instead of working with strings.

The second logical error is in the `isPrime` method. The method fails to check if the number is prime correctly. The fix should include updating the range in the for loop condition to check whether the number is prime.

In `countPrimeSetBits`, there is no bug; however, you should re-implement it to acheive efficient results by refining the `isPrime` and `calculateSetBits` methods.

The logical fix involves modifying the check condition to evaluate whether `n` is a prime number correctly.

The syntax error is found in code formatting as follows:
1. In `calculateSetBits`, avoid writing logic to convert string to binary.
2. In `isPrime`, unnecessary commented statements should be removed.

The below complete fixed code has addressed all the logical errors and syntax errors:

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculateSetBits(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            count += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n < 2) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public int countPrimeSetBits(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            int setBits = calculateSetBits(i);
            if (isPrime(setBits)) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
