The bug type in the provided code is Logical Error.

The code is a palindrome problem that tries to count the minimum number of steps to remove palindromic subsequences from the given string. 

The code contains a logical error in the `removePalindromeSub` method. The logic for finding the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty is incorrect. Additionally, the method does not handle the case when the input string is empty.

The fix is to apply the correct logic for determining the minimum number of steps, and to handle the empty string case explicitly.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return 0; // Empty string requires 0 steps
        }
        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left++) != s.charAt(right--)) {
                return 2; // As the string is not a palindrome, it can be minimized with 2 steps
            }
        }
        return 1; // If the string is a palindrome, it can be minimized with 1 step
    }
}
```
