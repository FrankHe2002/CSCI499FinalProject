Explanation:
The original code contains a logical error and a potential infinite loop. The condition `while (ans <= 0)` will lead to an infinite loop and prevent the `count` from being updated. Additionally, the loop should continue as long as `ans` is greater than 0, not lower than or equal to 0. Moreover, the operation `ans >>= 1` should be executed within the loop to shift the bits and iterate through the binary representation of `ans`.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int ans = x ^ y;
        int count = 0;
        while (ans > 0) {
            count += ans & 1;
            ans >>= 1;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
