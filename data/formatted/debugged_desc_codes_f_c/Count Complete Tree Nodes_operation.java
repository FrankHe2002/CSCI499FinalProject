The bug in the provided Java code is that it uses a postorder traversal to count the nodes in the tree, which results in a time complexity of O(n), but the constraints specify that the algorithm should run in less than O(n) time complexity.

To fix this, we can use the properties of a complete binary tree to optimize the node counting algorithm. The number of nodes in a complete binary tree can be calculated efficiently using the following rules:
1. If the tree is empty, it contains 0 nodes.
2. If the tree is not empty, calculate the height of the left and right subtrees, hL and hR:
   - If hL == hR, the left subtree is a full binary tree with height hL, so the number of nodes in the left subtree is 2^hL - 1 (excluding the root).
   - If hL != hR, the right subtree is a full binary tree with height hR-1, so the number of nodes in the right subtree is 2^hR-1 - 1 (excluding the root).
   - Recur on the appropriate subtree based on the comparison of hL and hR.

By using the above algorithm, we can achieve less than O(n) time complexity for counting the nodes in a complete binary tree efficiently.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 * int val;
 * TreeNode left;
 * TreeNode right;
 * TreeNode() {}
 * TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 * TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 * this.val = val;
 * this.left = left;
 * this.right = right;
 * }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int leftHeight = 0;
        int rightHeight = 0;
        TreeNode left = root;
        TreeNode right = root;

        while (left != null) {
            leftHeight++;
            left = left.left;
        }

        while (right != null) {
            rightHeight++;
            right = right.right;
        }

        if (leftHeight == rightHeight) {
            return (1 << leftHeight) - 1;
        } else {
            return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
        }
    }
}
```
