Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation:
The issue here is that the code does not properly handle scenarios where the root node itself is outside the bounds of [low, high]. This results in invalid tree trimming, as this code does not consider trimming the root itself.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 38.9 MB (Top 34.76%)
class Solution {
    public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        if (root.val < low) return trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        if (root.val > high) return trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        root.right = trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        return root;
    }
}
```
