The bug in the code is a logic error that causes the wrong number of monsters eliminated. 

Explanation of the Fix:
The issue arises from the way the time taken by each monster is calculated. As per the game's rules, if a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before the weapon can be used. The time taken for each monster's arrival needs to be calculated and compared to determine if they are eliminated in time.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int eliminateMaximum(int[] dist, int[] speed) {

        int n = dist.length;

        int[] time = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            time[i] = (int) Math.ceil(dist[i] * 1.0 / speed[i]);
        }

        Arrays.sort(time);

        int eliminated = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            if (time[i] > 1) {  // Comparing time taken by each monster to see if it reaches after the weapon is charged
                eliminated++;
            } else {
                break;  // Monster reached the city at the exact moment when the weapon was fully charged
            }
        }

        return eliminated;
    }
}
```
