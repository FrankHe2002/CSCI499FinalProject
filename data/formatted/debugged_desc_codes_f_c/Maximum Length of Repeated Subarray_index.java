The bug type in the provided code is a logical error.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug involves:
1. Understanding the expected behavior: The goal is to return the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Identifying the bug:
   - The `if` condition `if (nums1[i] == nums2[j + 1])` is missing proper array accesses. It should check for equality between `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`.
   - The array indices for `nums2` are also accessed incorrectly inside the inner loop.
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with size `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, but it is used with incorrect array access.
3. Applying the fix:
   - Update the `if` condition to `if (nums1[i] == nums2[j])`.
   - Modify the `dp` array accesses to `dp[i][j]` and adjust the boundary conditions and loop ranges accordingly.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLength(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length, m = nums2.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (nums1[i] == nums2[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j + 1] + 1;
                    if (ans < dp[i][j]) ans = dp[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
