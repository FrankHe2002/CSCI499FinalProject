The bug type in the provided Java code of the maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging function is related to the fact that it may not satisfy the condition of the absolute difference between any 2 adjacent elements being less than or equal to 1 after performing the described operations. 

The reasoning process includes identifying the constraints and expected behavior for the functions. Then, analyze the code logic and compare it to the expected behavior. Finally, perform the necessary fix based on the identified issue.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        arr[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) > 1) {
                arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return arr[arr.length - 1];
    }
}
```
