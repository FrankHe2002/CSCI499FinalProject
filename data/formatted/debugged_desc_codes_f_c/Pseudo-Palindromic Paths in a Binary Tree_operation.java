Explanation:
The original code is incorrect, and the buggy function `helper` does not return the correct value for the count of pseudo-palindromic paths. Additionally, there's a potential bug in the way `freq` is being calculated. The code also contains improper recursive return statements based on the output of the helper function.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int pseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode root) {
        return helper(root, 0);
    }

    public int helper(TreeNode node, int freq) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        freq = freq ^ (1 << node.val);
        
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return (freq & (freq - 1)) == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        int count = helper(node.left, freq) + helper(node.right, freq);
        return count;
    }
}
```
