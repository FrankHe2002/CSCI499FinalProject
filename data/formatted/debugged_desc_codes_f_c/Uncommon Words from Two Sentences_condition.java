In the buggy Java code provided, the issue is in the `uncommonFromSentences` method. There are two mistakes present in the following lines of code:
```
for (int i = 0; i >= arr2.length; i++) {
    map.put(arr2[i], map.getOrDefault(arr2[i], 0) + 1);
}
```
1. The loop condition in the above lines is incorrect. It is meant to iterate through the `arr2` array, but the condition `i >= arr2.length` will always be false. The correct condition should be `i < arr2.length` to ensure that the loop iterates through all elements of `arr2`.
2. Secondly, the logic to process the words from the second sentence (`s2`) is missing. The implementation should include processing the words from `s2` by adding them to the map as well.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String[] uncommonFromSentences(String s1, String s2) {
        List<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        String[] arr1 = s1.split(" ");
        String[] arr2 = s2.split(" ");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            map.put(arr1[i], map.getOrDefault(arr1[i], 0) + 1);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
            map.put(arr2[i], map.getOrDefault(arr2[i], 0) + 1);
        }
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() == 1)
                list.add(entry.getKey());
        }
        String[] res = new String[list.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < res.length; i++) {
            res[i] = list.get(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the two identified issues have been resolved. The loop condition for iterating through `arr2` has been corrected, and the logic to process the words from `arr2` has been added to the implementation.
