Bug Type: Logical Error

The issue is with the implementation of the minFlips method. The logic for counting the flips required to make the bitwise OR of a and b equal to c is incorrect. The implementation also contains some syntax errors like missing semicolons and missing brackets for if statements.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
        int count = 0;
        int x = a | b;
        while (c != 0 || x != 0) {
            int aa = x & 1;
            int bb = c & 1;
            if (aa == 0 && bb == 1) {
                count++;
            } else if (aa == 1 && bb == 0) {
                count += 1;
            }
            x = x >> 1;
            c = c >> 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
