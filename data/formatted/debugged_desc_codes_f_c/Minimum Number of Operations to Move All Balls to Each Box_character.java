Explanation:
The issue in the code is to calculate the number of operations to move all the balls to the ith box from the current state. The current implementation computes the number of operations in an inefficient manner. The correct number of operations to a particular box should be the sum of the distances of all the other boxes to that particular box that contain balls.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 87.71%) | Memory: 39.1 MB (Top 86.13%)

class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length();
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        int balls = 0; 
        int operations = 0; 
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            ans[i] += operations; 
            balls += boxes.charAt(i) - '0';
            operations += balls; 
        }
        balls=0; 
        operations = 0; 
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            ans[i] += operations; 
        balls += boxes.charAt(i) - '0'; 
        operations += balls; 
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
