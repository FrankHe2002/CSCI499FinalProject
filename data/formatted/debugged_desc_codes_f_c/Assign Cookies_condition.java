The bug type in the provided Java code is an indexing error.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug involves carefully reviewing the code and understanding the expected behavior. In the provided code, the issue is caused by the incorrect usage of array indices and the misunderstanding of the relationship between child greed factors and cookie sizes. The loop that checks for content children has an indexing error where the `i` variable is not correctly updating based on the comparison between greed factor and cookie size.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the loop to compare the current child's greed factor with each available cookie size and update the index accordingly.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < g.length && j < s.length) {
            if (g[i] <= s[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```
