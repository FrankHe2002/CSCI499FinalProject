Explanation:
The `isPowerOfFour` method is incorrectly implemented by using `Math.log11(n) / Math.log10(4)) % 1 == 0` to check if the number is a power of four. The issue here is that the use of `Math.log11(n)` mistakenly assumes that base 11 logarithm should be used to check for power of four, which is incorrect. The fix here is implementing the condition to check for the power of four correctly.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 64.18%) | Memory: 40.9 MB (Top 74.82%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (Math.log(n) / Math.log(4)) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
```
