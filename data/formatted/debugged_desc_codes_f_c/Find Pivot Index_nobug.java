The bug type in the given Java code is a logical error.

The original implementation incorrectly calculates the `rightsum` in the first for loop as `rightsum += nums[i]`, effectively skipping the element at index 0. This results in the method always returning -1 when an array with a pivot index of 0 is passed, casing an incorrect result. Additionally, there's a bug in the comparison `if (leftsum == rightsum)`.

The logical error is addressed by:
1. Initializing the leftsum and rightsum indices appropriately.
2. Correcting the comparison of leftsum and rightsum inside the second loop.

The bug is fixed by updating the code as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int pivotIndex(int[] nums) {
        int leftsum = 0;
        int rightsum = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) rightsum += nums[i];

        if (leftsum == rightsum || nums.length == 1) return 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            leftsum += nums[i - 1];
            rightsum -= nums[i];
            if (leftsum == rightsum) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
