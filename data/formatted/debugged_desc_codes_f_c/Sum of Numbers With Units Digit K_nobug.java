The bug in the code is a logical error in the nested conditional statement checking for `k == 0`. When `k` is equal to 0, it is trying to find the set with a unit digit of `0` in the initial conditional checking for `num == 0`. The previous code gives a compilation error due to the missing braces around the inner if block.

The fix involves adding braces around the inner `if` block of `k == 0` condition. And adding braces in the `else` part of `k == 0`. Additionally, it's a good practice to use `else if` condition to explicitly separate the two conditions that are meant to be mutually exclusive.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 90.88%) | Memory: 40.7 MB (Top 84.12%)

class Solution {
    public int minimumNumbers(int num, int k) {
        if (num == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (k == 0) {
            if (num % 10 == 0) { //E.g. 20,1590,3000
                return 1;
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= num / k; i++) { // Start with set size 1 and look for set having unit's digit equal to that of num
            if (num % 10 == ((i * k) % 10)) { // Look for equal unit's digit
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
This fix addresses the issue caused by the missing braces and logically separates exclusive conditions.
