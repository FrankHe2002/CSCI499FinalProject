The buggy code shown identifies the piles for you, Alice, and Bob incorrectly. The piles to be picked are determined by the instructions. The pile selection process should happen in a way that leaves Alice with the maximum coin pile. The solution is to skip a pile for you each time you and your friend Bob pick one. 

Additionally, within the for loop condition `i += 2` is checking for every second pile, but it should increment by 2 (i += 2) and not skip a pile.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[] piles) {
        Arrays.sort(piles);
        int s = 0, n = piles.length;
        for (int i = n / 3; i < n; i += 2)
            s += piles[i];
        return s;
    }
}
```
