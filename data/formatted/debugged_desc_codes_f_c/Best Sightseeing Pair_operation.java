The bug type is a logical error.

The `maxScoreSightseeingPair` method does not correctly calculate the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots. It doesn't account for the distance between the sightseeing spots. The computation for `dp[i]` and `ans` needs to consider the value of `values[j]` and should update `ans` based on the score of each valid pair.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be updated to:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScoreSightseeingPair(int[] values) {
        int n = values.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = values[0] + 0; // Initialize dp[0] considering position 0
        int ans = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j - 1], values[j] - j + dp[j - 1]); // Update dp[j] based on previous maximum
            ans = Math.max(ans, values[j] + j + dp[j - 1]); // Update ans based on the score of each pair
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
