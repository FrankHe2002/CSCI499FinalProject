The bug type in the provided Java code is 'Logical error'.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows:
- Upon examining the given code, it seems that there is no clear bug, but the code can be optimized.
- The code seems to calculate the maximum time for all seeds to bloom after their planting and growth times are known.
- The "plants" array must have a size of [n][2] instead of [n - 1][2].
- The loop iterating over the "plants" array does not correctly iterate over all plants due to an incorrect loop condition.
- The totalPlantTime seems to include the first plant's growing time as well, which is not getting adjusted when calculating maxTime, resulting in incorrect calculations.

To fix this:
- Change the declaration of the "plants" array to have a size of [n][2].
- Correct the loop condition for iterating over the "plants" array to iterate over all plants.
- After calculating maxTime, subtract the total growing days for each plant in "plants".

The fixed code in markdown is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 168 ms (Top 19.82%) | Memory: 126.2 MB (Top 22.91%)
class Solution {
    public int earliestFullBloom(int[] plantTime, int[] growTime) {
        int n = plantTime.length;
        int[][] plants = new int[n][2];
        int totalPlantTime = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            plants[i] = new int[] {plantTime[i], growTime[i]};
            totalPlantTime += plantTime[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(plants, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        int maxTime = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, totalPlantTime + plants[i][1]);
            totalPlantTime -= plants[i][0];
        }
        return maxTime;
    }
}
```
