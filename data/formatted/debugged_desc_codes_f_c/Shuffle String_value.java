The bug in the given code is that the original solution shuffles the string characters using the provided indices. However, the provided fix can result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the provided indices are not unique.

To fix this, we should traverse the given input string `s` based on its length and fetch the characters in accordance with the respective index from the `indices` array. Then, we can join these characters to produce the shuffled string. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
        char[] result = new char[s.length()]; // Initialize result array based on the length of string
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            result[indices[i]] = s.charAt(i); // Fetch the character from original string s and place it at the respective index position
        }
        return new String(result); // Convert character array back to a string and return the result
    }
}
```
