The bug type in the provided Java code is a semantic error.

The reasoning process for identifying the bug:
1. The given method `sortString` uses `remaining` to keep track of the number of characters remaining to be picked from the input string `s`.
2. The first loop iterates over the frequency array to pick the smallest character and append it to the result. However, it fails when `remaining` is never decremented to 0.
3. This indicates that the condition to check the end of string processing inside both the loops is incorrect.
4. Due to the condition, the loop for the second half of the string is not being executed.

Let's apply the fix to handle the end of string processing inside the loops.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public String sortString(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int remaining = s.length();
        while (remaining != 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (freq[i] != 0) {
                    freq[i]--;
                    result.append((char) (i + 'a'));
                    remaining--;
                }
            }
            for (int i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (freq[i] != 0) {
                    freq[i]--;
                    result.append((char) (i + 'a'));
                    remaining--;
                }
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that the loops run until the number of remaining characters is reduced to 0. This will correctly construct the result string according to the specified algorithm.
