The provided Java code has multiple issues:

1. In the `sampleStats` method, the calculation of the mean, median, and mode is incorrect, it has logical and arithmetic errors.
2. The initialization of ans[0] and ans[1] to -1 is unnecessary and incorrect as it goes against what the array represents

To remedy these issues, you may modify the `sampleStats` method as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public double[] sampleStats(int[] count) {
        double[] ans = new double[5];
        int countLength = count.length;
        int countEl = 0;
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        int modeIndex = 0;
        int totalElements = 0;
        int median1 = -1;
        int median2 = -1;
        int minVal = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxVal = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < countLength; i++) {
            if (count[i] > 0) {
                minVal = Math.min(minVal, i);
                maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, i);
                countEl += count[i];
                totalElements += count[i];
                if (count[i] > maxFrequency) {
                    maxFrequency = count[i];
                    modeIndex = i;
                }
            }
        }

        ans[0] = minVal;
        ans[1] = maxVal;
        ans[2] = countEl * 1.0 / totalElements;

        int countThreshold = countEl / 2 - 1;
        int nextThreshold = countEl / 2;
        int cumulativeCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < countLength; i++) {
            cumulativeCount += count[i];
            if (cumulativeCount > countThreshold && median1 == -1)
                median1 = i;
            if (cumulativeCount > nextThreshold) {
                median2 = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (totalElements % 2 == 0) {
            ans[3] = (median1 + median2) / 2.0;
        } else {
            ans[3] = median2;
        }

        ans[4] = modeIndex;

        return ans;
    }
}
```
