The bug in the provided Java code is as follows:
Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The `minBitFlips` function is designed to calculate the minimum number of bit flips required to convert one number to another. The bug lies in the declaration of variables `a1` and `a2`. It is expected that the input parameters are `start` and `goal` as described in the code description, but the parameter names do not align with the stated input requirements.

Also, the bug exists in the implementation of finding the minimum number of bit flips. The code generates an "inverted" `a1` and reduces it to `a2` while reducing the number of bit-flips. This is not the expected behavior. It should instead count the number of bit-flips required to transform `a1` into `a2`.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public static int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int n = (start ^ goal);
        int res = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            res += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
