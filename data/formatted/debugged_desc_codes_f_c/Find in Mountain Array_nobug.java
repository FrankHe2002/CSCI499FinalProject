The bug in the provided code is a logic error in the `findPeak` method. The method looks for the peak in the mountain array but has a flaw in the binary search implementation causing it to return the incorrect value.

The fix is to include the condition if the peak value is to be considered in the left search. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `binary` method's signature and its implementation to handle both left and right searches, passing the `mountainArr` and `peak` to determine the right bounds of the array to search.

Here's the corrected code in markdown format:

```java
  class Solution {
    public int findInMountainArray(int target, MountainArray mountainArr) {
        int peak = findPeak(mountainArr);

        int left = binary(0, peak, mountainArr, target, true, peak);
        if (left != -1) {
            return left;
        }
        int right = binary(peak + 1, mountainArr.length() - 1, mountainArr, target, false, peak);
        return right;
    }

    static int findPeak(MountainArray mountainArr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = mountainArr.length() - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + ((end - start) / 2);

            if (mountainArr.get(mid) < mountainArr.get(mid + 1)) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }

    static int binary(int low, int high, MountainArray arr, int target, boolean left, int peak) {
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);
            int midValue = arr.get(mid);
            if (target < midValue) {
                if (left) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else if (target > midValue) {
                if (left) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
