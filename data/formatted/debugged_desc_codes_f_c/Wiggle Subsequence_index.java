The bug type is a logical error.

The code is attempting to find the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums. The issue is in the `wiggleMaxLength` and `f` functions. 
In the initial `wiggleMaxLength` function, two arrays with size 1005 are created and initialized to -1. The `f` function involves a recursive strategy to track the longest wiggle subsequence. However, the initialization and storage of results for subproblems (i.e., dynamic programming) are unnecessary here and lead to inefficiency.

The fix will involve changing the recursive `f` function to an iterative algorithm using a tabulation approach for better efficiency. This simplifies the code while maintaining the intended functionality.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < 2) {
            return n;
        }
        int up = 1, down = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                up = down + 1;
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                down = up + 1;
            }
        }
        return Math.max(up, down);
    }
}
```
