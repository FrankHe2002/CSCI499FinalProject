The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The identified bug is in the `construct2DArray` method, which checks for the equality of `m % n` and `original.length`, which is incorrect. It should check for `m * n` being equal to `original.length` because the created 2D array has `m` rows and `n` columns.

The fix for the bug is to change the condition from `m % n != original.length` to `m * n != original.length` to ensure that the input array `original` can be entirely used to fill the 2D array of size `m x n`.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] construct2DArray(int[] original, int m, int n) {
        if (m * n != original.length) {
            return new int[0][0];
        }
        int[][] answer = new int[m][n];
        int rCount = 0, cCount = 0, len = original.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            answer[rCount][cCount++] = original[i];
            if (cCount == n) {
                rCount++;
                cCount = 0;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
