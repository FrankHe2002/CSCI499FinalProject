The bug in the provided Java code is that the while loop that calculates the number of water bottles drank does not account for the scenario when it's no longer possible to exchange empty bottles for full bottles.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic in the while loop to only execute when emptyBottles are greater than or equal to numExchange. Inside the loop body, we need to update the emptyBottles based on the amount of gained bottles and unused empty bottles.

The fixed code in markdown is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 39.2 MB (Top 18.64%)
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int drinkedBottles = numBottles;
        int emptyBottles = numBottles;

        while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
            int gainedBottles = emptyBottles / numExchange;
            drinkedBottles += gainedBottles;
            emptyBottles = emptyBottles % numExchange + gainedBottles;
        }
        return drinkedBottles;
    }
}
```
