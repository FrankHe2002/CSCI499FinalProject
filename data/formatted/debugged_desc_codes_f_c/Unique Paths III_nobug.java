        if (cr < 0 || cr == m || cc < 0 || cc == n || grid[cr][cc] == - 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (grid[cr][cc] == 2) {
            if (count - 1 == walk) return 1;
            return 0;

        grid[cr][cc] = - 1;
        int ans = 0;
        int[] r = {0, 1, 0, - 1};
        int[] c = {1, 0, - 1, 0};
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            ans += ways(grid, cr + r[i], cc + c[i], m, n, count + 1);

Reasoning: 
This code has the following issues:
1. The main issue is in the `ways` function where it uses `cr-1`, `cr+1`, `cc-1`, and `cc+1` for checking neighbors. Doing these checks, it goes diagonally as well, which is not allowed in 4-directional walks.
2. A missing account for obstacles (`grid[cr][cc] == - 1`) and returning the total 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, which walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.
3. Not checking non-zero occurrences and the presence of starting and ending squares.
   
The following fixes will be addressed:
1. Add the logic to skip the diagonal moves and check only vertically and horizontally, given the constraint of 4-directional walks.
2. Properly handle obstacles and ensure non-obstacle squares are accounted for in the walk count.
3. Check the presence of starting and ending squares before proceeding with path calculations.  

Fix:
```java

class Solution {
    int walk = 0;

    public int uniquePathsIII(int[][] grid) {
        int startRow = -1, startCol = -1;
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    startRow = i;
                    startCol = j;
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    walk++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ways(grid, startRow, startCol, m, n, 0);
    }

    public int ways(int[][] grid, int cr, int cc, int m, int n, int count) {
        if (cr < 0 || cr == m || cc < 0 || cc == n || grid[cr][cc] == -1 || grid[cr][cc] == 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (grid[cr][cc] == 2) {
            if (count - 1 == walk) return 1;
            return 0;
        }
        int original = grid[cr][cc];
        grid[cr][cc] = 3;
        int ans = 0;
        int[] r = {0, 1, 0, -1};
        int[] c = {1, 0, -1, 0};
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int newRow = cr + r[i];
            int newCol = cc + c[i];
            ans += ways(grid, newRow, newCol, m, n, count + 1);
