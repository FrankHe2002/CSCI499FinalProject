Bug type: Logical error

The issue in this code is a logical error that incorrectly computes the quantity of rearrangements of sticks visible from the left. In the function `rearrangeSticks`, the algorithm to calculate the visible sticks uses the multiplicative operator (`*`) on the terms `(j - 1) * M[i][j - 1]`, which doesn't correctly represent the possible arrangements of the sticks. 

To fix this, we will replace the multiplicative operator (`*`) with the additive operator (`+`) to correctly represent the possible arrangements of the sticks.

In addition, the function is designed to return an integer modulo 10^9+7, so the data type of `M` and the return value will need to be specified as `long` to avoid overflow.

The fixed code should be:

```java
// Fixed code
class Solution {
    public int rearrangeSticks(int n, int k) {
        final long MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        long[][] M = new long[k + 1][n + 1];
        M[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                M[i][j] = ((j * M[i - 1][j - 1] % MOD) + M[i][j - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        return (int) M[k][n];
    }
}
```
