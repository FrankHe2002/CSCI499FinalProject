The bug in the provided Java code is a missing semicolon (`;`) after the `count++` statement inside the minCameraCover method. This leads to a syntax error, as Java requires each statement to be terminated with a semicolon. Adding a semicolon at the end of `count++` resolves this issue.

Fix:
```java
public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
    if (helper(root) == -1)
        count++;
    return count;
}
```
