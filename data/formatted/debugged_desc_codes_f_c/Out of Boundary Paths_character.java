The provided Java code has a bug. The issue is that the count function is adding the modulo values twice and also taking the modulo twice, which is incorrect. To fix the bug, we need to make sure the modulo operation is performed once after all the additions within the count function.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 13 ms (Top 36.40%) | Memory: 43.3 MB (Top 32.31%
class Solution {
    int[][][] dp;
    int mod = 1000000007;

    public int findPaths(int m, int n, int maxMove, int startRow, int startColumn) {
        dp = new int[m][n][maxMove + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                for (int k = 0; k <= maxMove; k++)
                    dp[i][j][k] = - 1;
        return count(m, n, maxMove, startRow, startColumn);
    }

    public int count(int m, int n, int move, int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= m || c >= n)
            return 1;
        if (move <= 0)
            return 0;
        if (dp[r][c][move] != - 1)
            return dp[r][c][move] % mod;
        dp[r][c][move] = ((count(m, n, move - 1, r + 1, c) + count(m, n, move - 1, r - 1, c)) + (count(m, n, move - 1, r, c + 1) + count(m, n, move - 1, r, c - 1))) % mod;
        return dp[r][c][move] % mod;
    }
}
```
