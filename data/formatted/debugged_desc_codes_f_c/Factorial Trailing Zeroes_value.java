The bug is in the `trailingZeroes` method. The logic to count the number of trailing zeroes in n! is incorrect. The correct approach would be to repeatedly divide n by 5 until n becomes less than 5, and sum the quotients as the number of trailing zeroes.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n >= 5) {
            count += n / 5;
            n = n / 5;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
