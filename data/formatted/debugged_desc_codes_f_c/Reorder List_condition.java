The bug in the provided code is in the reorderList method. The condition `if (head != null)` is incorrect because it causes the method to immediately return without doing any work. Since the logic for finding the second list and merging the two lists relies on the head not being null, this condition disrupts the expected behavior.

The fix is to update the condition to `if (head == null)` to ensure that the reorderList method executes its logic when the head of the linked list is not null as intended.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return;

        // Find start of second list
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        ListNode list1 = head;
        ListNode list2 = reverseList(slow.next); // slow.next is start of list2

        // Break first list from second list!
        slow.next = null;

        // Merge list1 and list2
        while (list2 != null) {
            ListNode l1Next = list1.next;
            ListNode l2Next = list2.next;
            list2.next = list1.next;
            list1.next = list2;
            list1 = l1Next;
            list2 = l2Next;
        }
    }

    private ListNode reverseList(ListNode node) {
        if (node == null) return node;
        ListNode newHead = null, currNode = node;
        while (currNode != null) {
            ListNode backup = currNode.next;
            currNode.next = newHead;
            newHead = currNode;
            currNode = backup;
        }
        return newHead;
    }
}
```
