Bug Type:
1. Off-by-one error in loop condition.
2. Incorrect method call in the nested loop.
3. Incorrect recursive algorithm in the remover method.

Reasoning:
1. The loop condition in the nested for loops inside the countBattleships method contains an off-by-one error.
2. The method call in the nested loop to the remover method is incorrect due to the off-by-one error.
3. The recursive algorithm in the remover method seems to have inconsistencies, such as missing checks to prevent going out of the matrix bounds and inappropriate recursive calls.

Fix:
1. Change the loop condition in the nested for loops so that it iterates within the valid range of array indices.
2. Correct the method call in the nested loop to call the remover method properly.
3. Fix the recursive algorithm in the remover method to include checks to prevent going out of the matrix bounds and to use appropriate recursive calls.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 10.56%) | Memory: 44.7 MB (Top 26.11%)
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X') {
                    remover(i, j, board);
                    result++;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    public void remover(int i, int j, char[][] board) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.length || j < 0 || j >= board[i].length || board[i][j] == '.') {
            return;
        }
        board[i][j] = '.';
        remover(i + 1, j, board);
        remover(i, j + 1, board);
    }
}
```
