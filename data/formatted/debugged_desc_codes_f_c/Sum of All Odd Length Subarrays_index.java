Explanation:
The code has a logical error in calculating the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. The loop that calculates the running sum of the subarray does not correctly handle the starting index of the subarray. Additionally, the length calculation `(j - i + 1)` is also incorrect.

Fix:
The code needs to be fixed by correcting the calculation of the starting index and the length of the subarray.

The fixed code for `sumOddLengthSubarrays` function is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOddLengthSubarrays(int[] arr) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int prevSum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {
                prevSum += arr[j];
                if ((j - i + 1) % 2 == 1) {
                    sum += prevSum;
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
In this fix, the starting index of the subarray is correctly handled by updating the `prevSum` in the inner loop, and the correct length of the subarray calculation `(j - i + 1)` is used to determine whether the subarray has an odd length.
