The bug type is a logical error. The given Java code is supposed to return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of Pascal's triangle. However, the implementation contains a logical error resulting in incorrect output given certain inputs.

Logical Error Fix:
In the `getRow` method, the code should return the rowIndexth row of Pascal's triangle with index given by `rowIndex`. The provided code uses nested lists of integers to represent Pascal's triangle, initializing `list(i + 1)` to change to `list(i)` for `i = 0` and tweaking the inner `for` loop to `for (int i = 0; i <= rowIndex; i++)` and correcting the `if` statement. To fix this, the `getRow` method logic should be corrected to retrieve the rowIndexth row of Pascal's triangle directly.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        List<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
            row.add(0, 1);
            for (int j = 1; j < row.size() - 1; j++) {
                row.set(j, row.get(j) + row.get(j + 1));
            }
        }
        return row;
    }
}
```
