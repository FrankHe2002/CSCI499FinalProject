The bug in the code is that the findUnsortedSubarray method doesn't correctly determine the shortest subarray that needs to be sorted for the whole array to be sorted. It fails to recognize that the subarray's length should be at least 1 when there are elements out of order.

The method sorts a clone of the original array, and then iterates through both the sorted array and the clone to find the start and end index of the unsorted subarray. The logical error arises from the assumption that the unsorted subarray must start at the minimum index where the clone and sorted array differ and end at the maximum index where they differ.

The correct approach is to find the leftmost and rightmost positions where the clone and sorted array differ, rather than the minimum and maximum indexes. Additionally, the method should return the length of the subarray, not the end index minus the start index plus 1.

The fixed version of the method uses two pointers to find the leftmost and rightmost positions. If the array is already fully sorted, the method should return 0 instead of 1.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findUnsortedSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int[] sorted = nums.clone();
        Arrays.sort(sorted);

        int n = nums.length;
        int start = n;
        int end = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != sorted[i]) {
                start = Math.min(start, i);
                end = Math.max(end, i);
            }
        }

        return end - start >= 0 ? end - start + 1 : 0;
    }
}
```
