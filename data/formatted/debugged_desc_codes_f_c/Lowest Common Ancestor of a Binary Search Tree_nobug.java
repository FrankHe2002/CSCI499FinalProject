The bug type in all the examples is logical errors. The code has been written in such a way that it does not produce the correct output or does not align with the intended purpose or logic.

To fix these issues, we need to identify the incorrect operations or checks and modify them to align with the expected behavior. 

After analyzing the issues and the provided fixes, the complete fixed code in markdown is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMax(int[] nums) {
        int max = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > max) {
                max = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
            result += c;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public boolean isEven(int num) {
        return num % 2 == 0;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        if ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
        }
    }

// Provided code for finding the lowest common ancestor in a binary search tree was correct and has no logical errors
