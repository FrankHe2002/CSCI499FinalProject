The bug in the provided Java code is in the calculation of `res` for the left days. There is an issue with the prefix increment (`++`) operator and the usage of `m`.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The intention is to use `m` as a separate counter for the weeks while iterating with `i`.
2. The prefix increment `++` is misused within the loop for left days.
3. Instead, a separate variable should be used to increment the remaining days.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 39.1 MB (Top 94.89%)
class Solution {
    public int totalMoney(int n) {
        int m = n / 7; //(no.of full weeks)
        int res = 0; //for result
        //calculating full weeks
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            res += 7 * (i + 3);
        }
        //calculating left days
        int remaining = 7 * m;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n % 7; i++) {
            res += remaining + i;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
