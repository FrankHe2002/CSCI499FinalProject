The identified bug in the given Java code is that the `maximumEvenSplit` method is returning an incorrect list of integers that do not necessarily represent a valid split containing a maximum number of integers. 

The fix for this issue is adding a conditional check to the while loop to ensure that the remaining sum is greater than or equal to the current number (`while (currNum <= remainingSum)`), which will prevent adding numbers that exceed the remaining sum. Additionally, the condition to check if the remaining sum can be fulfilled by a larger even number needs to be adjusted for specific cases where the remaining sum becomes lesser than the current number. In such cases, the same number needs to be added to the list to ensure the maximum number of integers without exceeding the remaining sum. 

Fix:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<Long> maximumEvenSplit(long finalSum) {
        List<Long> res = new ArrayList<Long>();
        // odd sum cannot be divided into even numbers
        if (finalSum % 2 != 0) {
            return res;
        }
        // Greedy approach, try to build the total sum using the minimum unique even numbers
        long currNum = 2;
        long remainingSum = finalSum;
        // as long as we can add, subtract this number from remaining sum
        while (currNum <= remainingSum) {
            res.add(currNum);
            remainingSum -= currNum; // reducing remaining sum
            currNum += 2; // next even number
        }
        // now, remaining sum cannot be fulfilled by any larger even number
        // so extract the largest even number that was added to the previous index of res and make it larger by adding the remaining sum
        // add remaining sum to the last element
        if (currNum > remainingSum) {
            currNum -= 2;
            remainingSum += currNum;
            res.remove(res.size() - 1);
            res.add(currNum + remainingSum);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
