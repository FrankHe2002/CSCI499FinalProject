The bug type in the provided buggy Java code is a logic error.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows:
1. Analyze the code to understand its purpose and functionality.
2. Identify any obvious errors or mistakes in the code.
3. Test the code with different inputs to observe its behavior and identify any incorrect output.
4. Once the bug is identified, determine the appropriate fix to correct the logic error by changing the code to achieve the intended functionality.

Applying the fixes:
In the provided `asteroidsDestroyed` method, the logic that compares the masses of the asteroids and the planet is incorrect, which leads to incorrect results.

The fixed code for the `asteroidsDestroyed` method is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 476 ms (Top 5.23%) | Memory: 135.2 MB (Top 5.23%)
class Solution {
    public boolean asteroidsDestroyed(int mass, int[] asteroids) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int asteroid : asteroids) {
            if (asteroid < 0) {
                while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() > 0 && stack.peek() < Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
                if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek() < 0) {
                    stack.push(asteroid);
                } else if (stack.peek() == Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            } else {
                stack.push(asteroid);
            }
        }

        return stack.stream().allMatch(m -> m > 0);
    }
}
```

After applying the fix, the complete fixed code in markdown is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean asteroidsDestroyed(int mass, int[] asteroids) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int asteroid : asteroids) {
            if (asteroid < 0) {
                while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() > 0 && stack.peek() < Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
                if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek() < 0) {
                    stack.push(asteroid);
                } else if (stack.peek() == Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            } else {
                stack.push(asteroid);
            }
        }

        return stack.stream().allMatch(m -> m > 0);
    }
}
```
