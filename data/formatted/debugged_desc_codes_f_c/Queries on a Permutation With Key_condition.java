The bug in the code provided is in the second for loop in the processQueries method. The loop condition is `j <= permutations.size()`, and the code attempts to access an index out of the ArrayList's bounds. In Java, indices of ArrayList also range from 0 to `size - 1`. The fix is to change the loop condition to `j < permutations.size()`, ensuring the loop iterates only within the ArrayList's valid range. Additionally, the method uses an unnecessary ArrayList to store permutations. Instead, a simple array can be used. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] processQueries(int[] queries, int m) {
        int[] results = new int[queries.length];
        int[] permutations = new int[m];
        
        // Filling the permutations array with numbers.
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            permutations[i] = i + 1;
        
        // Looping on the queries & checking their index in the permutations
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int query = queries[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < permutations.length; j++)
                if (permutations[j] == query) {
                    results[i] = j;
                    int temp = permutations[j];
                    for (int k = j; k > 0; k--)
                        permutations[k] = permutations[k-1];
                    permutations[0] = temp;
                    break;
                }
        }
        
        return results;

    }
}
```
