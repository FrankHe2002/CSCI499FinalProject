Explanation:
The original intent of the code is to halve the sum of the array by reducing each number in the array to half. However, there are errors in how the numbers are added to the priority queue and how the 'sum' variable is being updated.

Fix:
The variable 'sum' should be initially set as the sum of the array and then it should be correctly updated when iterating through the array. The division in the for loop should be a multiplication.

```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int halveArray(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Double> q = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            sum += (double) i;
            q.add((double) i);
        }
        int res = 0;
        double req = sum;
        while (sum > req / 2) {
            double curr = q.poll();
            q.add(curr / 2);
            res++;
            sum -= curr / 2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
