Bug type: Logical Errors (nested for loop and condition)

Explanation:
1. The code has nested for loops which iterate through each word and each character of the word. This is unnecessary and counterproductive.
2. The comparison of strings is incorrect and doesn't yield the desired result.

Fix:
Remove the nested for loop and the unnecessary comparisons.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int isPrefixOfWord(String sentence, String searchWord) {
        if (!sentence.contains(searchWord)) {
            return -1;
        }
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");

        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (words[i].indexOf(searchWord) == 0) {
                return i + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
