Explanation:
The main issue with the `removeLeafNodes` function is that it doesn't properly handle the scenario where a leaf node's parent also becomes a leaf node after a deletion. 
Additionally, setting `root = null` effectively nullifies the current root, but not its parent's reference to it, potentially causing unwanted behavior.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode removeLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {
        if (root == null)
            return root;
        root.left = removeLeafNodes(root.left, target);
        root.right = removeLeafNodes(root.right, target);
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null && root.val == target)
            return null;
        return root;
    }
}
```
