The given Java code calculates the minimum number of operations to form a target array from the initial array. The function takes an integer array target as input and returns the minimum number of operations.

The logic behind the implementation is to calculate the difference between the current and previous elements and accumulate these differences, which signifies the number of operations needed to form the target array.

The code runs correctly and doesn't contain any bugs. The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the target array, and the space complexity is O(1).

The fix requirement should be omitted as the code is already correct, and no changes are needed.

Final fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 98.94%) | Memory: 51.4 MB (Top 94.35%)
// Imagine 3 cases
// Case 1. [3,2,1], we need 3 operations.
// Case 2. [1,2,3], we need 3 operations.
// Case 3. [3,2,1,2,3], we need 5 operations.
// What we need to add is actually the diff (cur / prev)
// Time complexity: O(N)
// Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
        int res = 0;
        int prev = 0;
        for (int cur : target) {
            if (cur > prev) {
                res += cur - prev;
            }
            prev = cur;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
