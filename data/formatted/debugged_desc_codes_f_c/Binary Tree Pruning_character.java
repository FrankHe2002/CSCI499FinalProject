The given Java code has a few issues. The code is missing curly braces for the `pruneTree` method and the return type is not specified for the method. Also, the TreeNode class is not defined.

The following is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.0%) | Memory: 39.81 MB (Top 82.6%)

class Solution {
    public TreeNode pruneTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return root;

        root.left = pruneTree(root.left);
        root.right = pruneTree(root.right);

        if (root.left == null && root.right == null && root.val == 0) return null;
        else return root;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we added the missing curly braces for the `pruneTree` method, and specified the return type of the method as `TreeNode`. Additionally, the TreeNode class must be defined to use this code effectively.
