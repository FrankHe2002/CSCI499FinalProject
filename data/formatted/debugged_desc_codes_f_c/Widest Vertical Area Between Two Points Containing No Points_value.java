Bug Type:
Logical error

Reasoning:
The logic used to calculate the maximum width of the vertical area is incorrect. The code finds the maximum difference between consecutive x-coordinates. However, the issue is that not all differences between x-coordinates represent the width of a vertical area, as some differences will be between x-coordinates of points that are not part of the same vertical area.

Fix:
To fix this logical error, the code needs to correctly calculate the maximum width of the vertical area. This can be done by finding the maximum difference between consecutive x-coordinates of points, considering that points sorted by x-coordinate are likely to form the boundary of the vertical area. Adjust the variable initialization to initialize `diff` as 0 instead of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.

The fixed code is provided below.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        int L = points.length;
        int[] arr = new int[L];
        for (int i = 0; i < L; i++) {
            arr[i] = points[i][0];
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr);

        int diff = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < L; i++) {
            if ((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) > diff) {
                diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return diff;
    }
}
```
