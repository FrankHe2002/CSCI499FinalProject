The issue: 
The issue is that the condition `for (char ch = 'Z'; ch < 'A'; ch--)` in the second loop will never be true because it's initialized with 'Z' and the loop will only run if 'ch' is less than 'A', but since 'Z' is greater than 'A', the loop does not execute. 
Also, there are missing curly braces for the second for loop.

The fix:
The fix is to change the condition from `ch < 'A'` to `ch >= 'A'` and add curly braces in the second loop to encompass the if condition as well.
Additionally, add `import java.util.HashSet;` and `import java.util.Set;` to avoid compilation errors.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public String greatestLetter(String s) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            set.add(ch);
        }

        for (char ch = 'Z'; ch >= 'A'; ch--) {
            if (set.contains(ch) && set.contains((char) ('a' + (ch - 'A')))) {
                return "" + ch;
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
}
```
