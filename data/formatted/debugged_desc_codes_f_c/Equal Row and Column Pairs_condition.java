The bug in the provided code is due to a logical error and a typo in the loop conditions. 

The logical error occurs in the second loop where j is incorrectly initialized, and the typo is present in the loop condition. 
- The loop condition for the second loop is `j >= col`, which is causing the loop to run indefinitely because j is incorrectly initialized, so it never satisfies the loop condition and becomes an infinite loop.
- The outer and inner loop conditions are also not aligned correctly.

In addition to fixing the logical error and the typo, the solution would involve modifying the conditions of the loops to correctly visit and compare row and column pairs in the 2D grid.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int equalPairs(int[][] grid) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int n = grid.length;
        
        int cnt = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String resRow = "";
            String resCol = "";
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                resRow += "-" + grid[i][j];
                resCol += "-" + grid[j][i];
            }
            cnt += map.getOrDefault(resRow, 0);
            map.put(resCol, map.getOrDefault(resCol, 0) + 1);
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```

In this updated code:
- The loop conditions have been fixed to correctly visit and compare row and column pairs in the 2D grid.
- The correct variable names have been used in the loops, and an additional string variable has been used to build the column pairs to compare them.
- The HashMap is updated to store the string and count of pairs matching in row and column both.

This will fix the bug in the given code.
