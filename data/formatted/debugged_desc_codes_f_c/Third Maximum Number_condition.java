The provided buggy Java code has an incorrect implementation for finding the third maximum number in an array. The original code mainly mishandles conditions when checking for the first, second, and third maximum elements. The logic needs to be changed so that it accurately determines the third maximum number from the given array while considering distinct elements properly.

The fixed code for the third maximum number problem is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        Integer first = null, second = null, third = null;
        
        for (Integer num : nums) {
            if (num.equals(first) || num.equals(second) || num.equals(third))
                continue;
            
            if (first == null || num > first) {
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = num;
            } 
            else if (second == null || num > second) {
                third = second;
                second = num;
            } 
            else if (third == null || num > third) {
                third = num;
            }
        }
        
        return (third != null) ? third : first;
    }
}
```
