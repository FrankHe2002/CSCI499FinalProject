Bug Type: Syntax Error

The issue in the given code is a syntax error. There are missing parentheses and incorrect method calls in the line within the for-loop.

Explanation:
1. The `replace` function in Java is missing parentheses and should be called as `replace("1", "")` and `replace("0", "")` to remove the specified characters from the substring.
2. The `length()` method call should be replaced with `length()` to get the length of the replaced substrings by the `replace` function.
3. The `substring` function only returns the part of the original string and should be called as `s.substring(0, i + 1)` and `s.substring(i + 1)` to get the left and right substrings.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 17 ms (Top 14.4%) | Memory: 44.28 MB (Top 5.7%)

class Solution {
    public int maxScore(String s) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, s.substring(0, i + 1).replace("1", "").length() + s.substring(i + 1).replace("0", "").length());
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
