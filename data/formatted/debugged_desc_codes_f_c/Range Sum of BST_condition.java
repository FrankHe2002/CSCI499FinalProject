The buggy Java code contains a logical error in the `dfs` method when adding the value of the current node to the sum. The condition in the if-statement to check if the node's value is within the range `[low, high]` is incorrect. Additionally, for nodes within the range, the method should still process both its left and right subtrees.

The issue is with the condition `root.val < low && root.val <= high` which incorrectly checks if the node's value is less than `low` and less than or equal to `high`. A correction should be made based on the inclusive range condition, i.e., a node's value should be within the range `[low, high]`.

Additionally, regardless of the condition evaluation, both the left and right subtrees should be processed. The current implementation does not efficiently accomplish this.

The fixed code for the provided buggy Java code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    private int sum = 0;

    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        dfs(root, low, high);
        return sum;
    }

    public void dfs(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) return;

        if (root.val >= low && root.val <= high) {
            sum += root.val;
        }
        if (root.val > low) dfs(root.left, low, high);
        if (root.val < high) dfs(root.right, low, high);
    }
}
```
