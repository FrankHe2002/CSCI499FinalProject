The bug in the provided code is that it doesn't handle the case when the truncated sentence has exactly k words.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `count` is equal to `k` after the while loop finishes and return the substring accordingly.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String truncateSentence(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == ' ') {
                count++;
                if (count == k)
                    return s.substring(0, i);
            }
            i++;
        }
        // Check if the truncated sentence has exactly k words
        if (count == k - 1)
            return s.substring(0, i);
        return s;
    }
}
```
