The bug type identified here is a logical error within the `dfs` method. After the recursive call in the `dfs` method, there are incorrect indices being used when adding `toppingCosts` to `cost`. The for loop and the stopping condition are not correctly implemented. 

The fix will involve appropriately using the `toppingIndex` when referencing `toppingCosts` and ensuring that the loop proceeds through the array without going out of bounds. Also, proper stopping conditions are needed to avoid infinite recursion and to terminate early if the cost exceeds the target.

Here is the fixed Java code:
```java
class Solution {
    int closestCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int closestCostDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    public int closestCost(int[] baseCosts, int[] toppingCosts, int target) {
        for (int base : baseCosts) {
            dfs(toppingCosts, 0, base, target);
        }
        return closestCost;
    }

    public void dfs(int[] toppingCosts, int toppingIndex, int cost, int target) {
        int costDiff = Math.abs(target - cost);
        if (costDiff < closestCostDiff || (costDiff == closestCostDiff && cost < closestCost)) {
            closestCostDiff = costDiff;
            closestCost = cost;
        }

        if (toppingIndex >= toppingCosts.length)
            return;

        // Add zero topping or one topping
        dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost, target);
        dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost + toppingCosts[toppingIndex], target);

        // Add two toppings
        dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost + 2 * toppingCosts[toppingIndex], target);
    }
}
```
