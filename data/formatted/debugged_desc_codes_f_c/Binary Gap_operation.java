The bug in the code is with calculating the binary gap by dividing adjacent positions for the 1's. This would give the relative distance between the positions, not the absolute difference between their bit positions.

The fixed code should use subtraction to calculate the absolute difference between the bit positions and then take the maximum difference between all 1's.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int binaryGap(int n) {
        char[] arr = Integer.toBinaryString(n).toCharArray();
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == '1')
                ans.add(i);
        }
        int res = 0;
        if (ans.size() > 1) {
            for (int i = 0; i < ans.size() - 1; i++) {
                res = Math.max(res, ans.get(i + 1) - ans.get(i));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
