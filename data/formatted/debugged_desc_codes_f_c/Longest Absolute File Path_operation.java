The bug is in the `lengthLongestPath` method inside the for loop. There's an issue in calculating the length of the current path in the stack and updating the stack. 

The bug can be identified as follows:
- The statement `stack.push(current + nameLength % 1);` looks incorrect. It appears that `nameLength % 1` should be removed.
- The `isFilename` method checks if the string ends with a '.' to identify a file, which is not appropriate. It should be using `nameLength > 0` to check if it's a file.

By making these fixes and correcting other minor issues, the final fixed code will look as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 81.1%) | Memory: 40.51 MB (Top 47.9%)

import java.util.ArrayDeque;

class Solution {
    public int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
        var stack = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
        int max = 0;
        
        String[] lines = input.split("\n");
        for (var line : lines) {
            int tabs = countTabs(line);
            
            while (tabs < stack.size()) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            
            int current = stack.isEmpty() ? 0 : stack.peek();
            int nameLength = line.length() - tabs;
            
            if (isFile(nameLength)) {
                max = Math.max(max, current + nameLength);
            } else {
                stack.push(current + nameLength + 1);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
    
    private int countTabs(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        while (s.charAt(count) == '\t') {
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private boolean isFile(int nameLength) {
        return nameLength > 0;
    }
}
```
