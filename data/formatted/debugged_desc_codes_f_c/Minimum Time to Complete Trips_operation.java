The identified issue in the code is a syntax error in the declaration of the variable `anstillnow`. The percentage sign (`%`) in the declaration causes the syntax error.

The correct approach for declaring a variable would be to assign an initial value or leave it unassigned.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumTime(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        long anstillnow = 1;  // Assigning an initial value

        long left = 1, right = 100000000000001L;

        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  
            long curr_trips = 0;
            for (int t : time) {
                curr_trips += mid / t;
            }

            if (curr_trips >= totalTrips) {
                anstillnow = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return anstillnow;
    }
}
```
