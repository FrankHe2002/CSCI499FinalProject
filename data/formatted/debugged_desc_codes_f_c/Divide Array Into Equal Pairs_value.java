The bug type in the provided Java code is in the logic of the `divideArray` function. It calculates the frequency of each element in the array and returns true if the frequency of each element is even, implying that each element can form a pair. However, the mistake is that it does not consider that a valid pair can only be formed by elements found in pairs and with equal values. To fix this, we need to modify the logic to pair up the elements.

The corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean divideArray(int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i : arr) {
            map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int pairs = 0;
        for (int i : map.keySet()) {
            pairs += map.get(i) / 2;
        }
        
        return pairs >= arr.length / 2;
    }
}
```
