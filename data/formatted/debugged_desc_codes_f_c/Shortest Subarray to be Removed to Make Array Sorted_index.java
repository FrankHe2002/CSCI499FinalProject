The identified bug type is a logical error. The purpose of the given code is to find the length of the shortest subarray to remove from the given array so that the remaining elements in the array are non-decreasing. However, the current implementation contains a logical error at the last for loop where the conditions and operations are not correctly identifying the shortest subarray to remove.

To fix this logical error and improve the implementation of the code, the most efficient approach is to rewrite the complete function based on the given logic and replace it with a more accurate solution for finding the length of the shortest subarray.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfShortestSubarray(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int start = 0;
        while (start < n - 1 && arr[start] <= arr[start + 1]) {
            start++;
        }
        if (start == n - 1) return 0; // Base case for a non-decreasing sequence

        int end = n - 1;
        while (end > 0 && arr[end] >= arr[end - 1]) {
            end--;
        }

        int result = Math.min(n - start - 1, end); // Possibilities 1 or 2 as mentioned above

        int i = start, j = end;
        while (i >= 0 && j < n) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
                result = Math.min(result, j - i - 1);
                i--;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

The fixed code includes a complete rewrite of the logic to accurately find the length of the shortest subarray to remove, based on the constraints and expected behavior of the function.
