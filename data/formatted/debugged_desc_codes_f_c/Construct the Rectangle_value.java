The bug is in the `constructRectangle` method within the for loop. There are two issues:
1. The assignment of values to the result array is incorrect. It should be `result[0] = l;` instead of `result[1] = l;` and `result[1] = w;` instead of `result[1] = w;`.
2. The condition to check if the width `w` is larger than the length `L` (`w * w <= area`) is incorrect.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] result = new int[2];

        for (int w = 1; w * w <= area; w++) {
            if (area % w == 0) {
                int l = area / w;
                int diff = l - w;
                if (diff < minDiff) {
                    result[0] = l;
                    result[1] = w;
                    minDiff = diff;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
