Explanation:
The bug in the given code is the logic used to populate the `ans` array. The second for loop condition is incorrect and will never execute, preventing the array from storing the negative integers. To fix this, the condition of the second for loop should be `i < n / 2`, instead of `i > n / 2`. Additionally, the use of `i` must be decremented.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sumZero(int n) {
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        int j = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
            ans[j] = i;
            j++;
        }
        for (int i = n / 2; i > 0; i--) {
            ans[j] = -i;
            j++;
        }
        if (n % 2 != 0) ans[j] = 0;

        return ans;
    }
}
```
