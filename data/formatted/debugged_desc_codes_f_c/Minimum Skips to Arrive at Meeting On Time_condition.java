Bug type: Logical Error

The original code is a conceptual mathematical solution to a problem. Upon reviewing the code, the 'ceil' method appears to contain a rounding error. It takes two arguments, an integer n, and an integer s, and is intended to return the ceiling of n divided by s. The logic in the 'ceil' method needs to be reviewed for mathematical accuracy.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSkips(int[] dist, int speed, int hoursBefore) {
        int N = dist.length, INF = (int) 1e9;
        int[] dp = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(dp, INF);
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--) {
                dp[j] = Math.min(j == 0 ? INF : dp[j - 1] + dist[i], computeTime(dp[j], dist[i], speed));
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (computeTime(dp[i], 0, speed) <= hoursBefore) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

    private int computeTime(int n, int d, int speed) {
        return (n + d) / speed * speed < (n + d) ? ((n + d) / speed + 1) * speed : (n + d);
    }
}
```
The updated 'computeTime' method uses the mathematical computation to find the time required, rather than using a potentially incorrect algorithm. The data types, logic, and methodology of the solution have been preserved.
