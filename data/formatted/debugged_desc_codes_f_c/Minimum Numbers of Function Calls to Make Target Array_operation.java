The bug in the given code is the incomplete and incorrect `dfs` method logic. The correct implementation should determine the minimum number of function calls to make `nums` from `arr` using the `modify` function, ensuring that it:
- Modifies the given array `arr` elements
- Converts `arr` to `nums`
These requirements were poorly implemented with an incorrect `dfs` method, which led to the entire solution being incorrect.

To fix this bug, the following changes should be made:
- Update the `dfs` method and its invocation in the `minOperations` method to correctly simulate the `modify` function and calculate the minimum number of function calls.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int minOperations = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            while (n > 0) {
                if (n % 2 == 0) {
                    n /= 2;
                } else {
                    n -= 1;
                }
                minOperations++;
            }
        }
        return minOperations - 1;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
- We iterate through the array `nums` and calculate the number of operations required to convert each integer in `nums` from 0 to the given number using the `modify` function.
- For each element `n` in `nums`, we count the number of operations required and maintain a running total of the minimum operations using `minOperations`.
- Finally, we return `minOperations - 1` as the minimum number of function calls, as the last operation would have been an extra call.
