Code Description:
The provided code aims to find the nth magical number given three input integers n, a, and b. The code implements an algorithm with a while loop, which uses binary search to find the nth magical number. However, the code is vulnerable to several runtime errors and doesn't comply with the problem's constraints.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int nthMagicalNumber(int n, int a, int b) {
        long N = (long) n;
        long A = (long) a;
        long B = (long) b;
        long mod = 1000000007;
        long lcm = lcm(A, B);
        long low = 0;
        long high = (long) Math.min(A, B) * N;
        long ans = 0;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long count = mid / A + mid / B - mid / lcm;
            if (count >= N) {
                ans = mid % mod;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }

    long gcd(long a, long b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }

    long lcm(long a, long b) {
        return a * b / gcd(a, b);
    }
}
