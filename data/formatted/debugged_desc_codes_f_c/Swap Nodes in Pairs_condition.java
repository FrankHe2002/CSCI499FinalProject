The buggy Java code contains an error in the while loop condition when trying to swap every two adjacent nodes in a linked list.

The bug makes the loop never execute because of the incorrect condition `while (curr == null && curr.next != null)`. The correct condition should be `while (curr != null && curr.next != null)` to ensure the loop is entered when there are at least two nodes to swap.

The fixed code should look like this:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0), prev = dummy, curr = head;
        dummy.next = head;
        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            prev.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
            prev.next.next = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
            prev = prev.next.next;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
The above fixed code updates the while loop condition to `while (curr != null && curr.next != null)`, which should now correctly swap every two adjacent nodes in the linked list.
