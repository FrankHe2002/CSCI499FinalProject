Explanation:
The original code has an incorrect condition for updating the variable zeroToOne. It currently updates zeroToOne by choosing the minimum value between zeroToOne + 1 and countOfOnes. It should instead update this value only if it's less than or equal to countOfOnes + 1. This ensures that the binary string s is monotone increasing.

There is also an issue with updating countOfOnes. It is updated incorrectly by adding the count with 1, which should not be the case.

Additionally, considering the condition where more 1s need to be followed by 0s, a second counting variable is required and adding one more if block is needed to see if the 1s need further change.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlipsMonoIncr(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int zeroToOne = 0;
        int countOfOnes = 0;
        int oneToZero = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '0') {
                zeroToOne = Math.min(zeroToOne, countOfOnes);

            } else { 
                countOfOnes++;
                oneToZero = Math.min(oneToZero + 1, countOfOnes);
            }
        }
        return Math.min(zeroToOne, oneToZero);
    }
}
```
