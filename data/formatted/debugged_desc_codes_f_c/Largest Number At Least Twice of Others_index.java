The bug type in the provided code is logical error.

The reasoning for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows:
1. `int` variables `max` and `smax` are initially set to -1, which may lead to incorrect comparison logic.
2. The typo `else if (smax == - 1 || nums[i] >= nums[nums])` - `nums[nums]` should be `nums[max]` to compare against the max value. Also, the condition should involve `nums[smax]`, not `nums[i]`.
3. In the final if condition, `nums[max] >= 2 * nums[smax]`, it returns -1 if the largest element is not at least twice as much as every other number, which contradicts the requirement to return the index if it's not the case.

To fix the bug, the initializations of `max` and `smax` need to have correct initial values. The comparison logic inside the loop should be corrected. Finally, the return statement should return `max` if the condition is true, and should return -1 otherwise.

The fixed code in markdown format is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int dominantIndex(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0;
        int smax = -1;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] >= nums[max]) {
                smax = max;
                max = i;
            } else if (smax == -1 || nums[i] >= nums[smax]) {
                smax = i;
            }
        }

        if (smax != -1 && nums[max] < 2 * nums[smax]) {
            return -1;
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
