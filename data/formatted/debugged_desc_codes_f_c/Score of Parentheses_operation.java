Explanation:
The issue in the provided code is with the main logic of score calculation with parentheses strings, which is not implemented correctly. The given if condition and calculation of score in the `else` block does not adhere to the logic specified in the problem statement.

The logic should be modified to correctly calculate the score of the parentheses string. Essentially, we need to replace the incorrect logic with the correct scoring logic, following the rules outlined in the problem description.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int scoreOfParentheses(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int score = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (ch == '(') {
                stack.push(score);
                score = 0;
            } else {
                score = stack.pop() + Math.max(2 * score, 1);
            }
        }
        return score;
    }
}
```
