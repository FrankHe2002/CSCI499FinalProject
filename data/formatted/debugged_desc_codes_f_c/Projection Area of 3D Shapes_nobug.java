The bug type in the provided code is a logical error. The code does not correctly calculate the total area of projections of the 3-dimensional figure onto 2-dimensional planes.

The error in the original code is in the logic to calculate the total area. The code only counts the maximum height for each row and column, but it incorrectly calculates the area of the projection. The total area increases based on whether there is a cell with a non-zero height, rather than the actual height of the highest tower in each row and column.

The fix involves updating the logic to calculate the total area correctly. It should calculate the xy-plane projection area, the xz-plane projection area, and the yz-plane projection area.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int projectionArea(int[][] grid) {
        int xyArea = 0;
        int xzArea = 0;
        int yzArea = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            int maxRow = 0;
            int maxCol = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                    xyArea++;
                }
                maxRow = Math.max(maxRow, grid[i][j]);
                maxCol = Math.max(maxCol, grid[j][i]);
            }
            xzArea += maxRow;
            yzArea += maxCol;
        }

        return xyArea + xzArea + yzArea;
    }
}
```
