The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The code provided is identifying the number of nodes with the highest score in a binary tree, but there are errors in the implementation.

Upon the first observation, there is an issue with the variable declarations of `max` and `res`. These should be declared inside the method `countHighestScoreNodes` to maintain encapsulation and prevent unexpected behavior and issues related to these variables on subsequent function calls.

Once the calculations are observed, there are issues related to the calculation of the highest score. Before counting the result, `max` should be calculated after the `dfs` has been executed to prevent the duplicate calculations. In addition, the conditionals for comparing `mult` and updating `res` have logic issues. Therefore, there are logical errors in the manipulation of `res`.

Below is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int countHighestScoreNodes(int[] parents) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> hm = new HashMap<>();
        // build the tree
        for (int i = 0; i < parents.length; i++) {
            hm.computeIfAbsent(parents[i], x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
        }
        
        long[] result = new long[3];
        dfs(0, parents.length, hm, result);
        
        return (int) result[2];
    }

    void dfs(int s, int n, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> hm, long[] result) {
        int sum = 1;
        long mult = 1L;
        
        List<Integer> children = hm.getOrDefault(s, new ArrayList<>());
        for (int child : children) {
            dfs(child, n, hm, result);
            int count = (int) result[0]; // subtree node count
            sum += count;
            mult *= count; // multiply the result by children size
        }
        
        mult *= (s == 0 ? 1L : n - sum); // multiply the result by remain size except self and children size(the nodes through parent)
        
        if (mult > result[1]) {
            result[1] = mult;
            result[2] = 1;
        } else if (mult == result[1]) {
            result[2]++;
        }
        
        result[0] = sum; // store the node count of the tree rooted at s
        result[1] = Math.max(result[1], mult);
    }
}
