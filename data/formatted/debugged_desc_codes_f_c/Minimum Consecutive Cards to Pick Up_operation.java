The identified bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error in the `minimumCardPickup` function. The function attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive cards that need to be picked up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the minimum number of consecutive cards. The error is in the line `min = Math.min(i - map.get(cards[i]) + 1, min);` where the subtraction is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `min = Math.min(i - map.get(cards[i]) + 1, min); - 1`, accounting for the difference in indices and adding one to the result.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumCardPickup(int[] cards) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(cards[i]))
                min = Math.min(i - map.get(cards[i]) + 1, min) - 1; // Check if the difference in indices is smaller than minimum
            map.put(cards[i], i); // Update the last found index of the card
        }
        return min == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : min; // Repetition found or not
    }
}
```
