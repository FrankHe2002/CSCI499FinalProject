Bug Type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
After reviewing the assignment description and the code, the method `maximumSubsequenceCount` does not accurately find the maximum number of times pattern occurs as a subsequence of the modified text. The original implementation is convoluted and does not correctly address the problem.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public long maximumSubsequenceCount(String text, String pattern) {
        return Math.max(text.chars().filter(c -> c == pattern.charAt(0)).count(),
                        text.chars().filter(c -> c == pattern.charAt(1)).count());
    }
}
```
