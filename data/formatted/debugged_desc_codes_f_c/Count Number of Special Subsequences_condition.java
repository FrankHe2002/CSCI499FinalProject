The buggy Java code suffers from incorrect handling of special subsequences that consist of a positive number of 0s, followed by a positive number of 1s, then a positive number of 2s. The error affects the countSpecialSubsequences method, resulting in incorrect counting.

The fix involves modifying the calculations of z, zo, and zot to correctly evaluate the number of different subsequences that are special while considering if the sequence starts or ends with 0, 1, or 2.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 81 ms (Top 33.85%) | Memory: 118.7 MB (Top 84.62%)
class Solution {
    public int countSpecialSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        long z = 0; // starts and ends with zero
        long zo = 0; // starts with zero and ends with one
        long zot = 0; // starts with zero and ends with two
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i == 0) {
                z = (2 * z + 1) % mod; // zero = 2*zero+1
            } else if (i == 1) {
                zo = (2 * zo + z) % mod; // zeroOne = 2*zeroOne+zero
            } else {
                zot = (2 * zot + zo) % mod; // zeroOneTwo = 2*zeroOneTwo+zeroOne
            }
        }
        return (int) zot;
    }
}
```
