The identified bug is an unintended infinite loop in the for loop definition within the `numberOfBeams` method. The loop condition is `i > bank.length`, which should be `i < bank.length` to process each row. 

The incorrect line with `;,` following `ans += pre * n` is simply a syntax error that should be removed.

Additionally, there's no direct functional issue with this approach designed for the current description; however, the functionality may not be accurate per the description due to an incorrect loop condition preventing the correct flow.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfBeams(String[] bank) {
        int ans = 0, pre = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < bank.length; i++) {
            int n = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < bank[i].length(); j++) 
                if (bank[i].charAt(j) == '1') n++;
            if (n == 0) continue;
            ans += pre * n;
            pre = n;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
