The bug in the code is that the calculation of the total number of ways the string can be split is not being performed correctly. Also, there is a logic issue in calculating the number of ways in which part1 and part2 can be split. The line "return (int)((((n - 1) * (n - 2)) / 2) * mod);" is also providing an incorrect calculation based on the requirement. 
The following is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWays(String s) {
        long n = s.length();
        long one = 0;           // to count number of ones
        long mod = 1_000_000_007;
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < c.length; i++) {
            if (c[i] == '1')
                one++;
        }
        
        if (one == 0) {             //case 1
            long result = (int)((((n - 1)*(n - 2)) / 2) % mod);
            return (int) result;
        }
        if (one % 3 != 0) {         //case 2,which means we can't split ones equally
            return 0;
        }
        //case 3
        long ones = one / 3;        //number of ones that should be present in each part
        long part1 = 0;             //number of ways in which part1 and part2 can be split
        long part2 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < c.length; i++) {
            if (c[i] == '1')
                one++;
            if (one == ones)
                part1++;
            if (one == 2 * ones)
                part2++;
        }
        long result = ((part1 * part2) % mod);
        return (int) result;
    }
}
```
