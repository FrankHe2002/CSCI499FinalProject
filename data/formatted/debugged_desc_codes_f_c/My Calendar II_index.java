The bug in the given Java code is in the `book` method of the `MyCalendarTwo` class. It does not correctly handle double bookings in the loops and is prone to causing triple bookings.

In order to fix the issue, I will make the following changes:
1. Change the condition for checking for overlapping in the first loop to use the correct indices from the array `b`.
2. Correctly calculate the double bookings based on the overlaps in the second loop.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class MyCalendarTwo {
    private List<int[]> bookings;
    private List<int[]> doubleBookings;

    public MyCalendarTwo() {
        bookings = new ArrayList<>();
        doubleBookings = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] b : doubleBookings) {
            if (start < b[1] && end > b[0]) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        for (int[] b : bookings) {
            int overlapStart = Math.max(start, b[0]);
            int overlapEnd = Math.min(end, b[1]);
            if (overlapStart < overlapEnd) {
                doubleBookings.add(new int[] {overlapStart, overlapEnd});
            }
        }

        bookings.add(new int[] {start, end});
        return true;
    }
}
```
