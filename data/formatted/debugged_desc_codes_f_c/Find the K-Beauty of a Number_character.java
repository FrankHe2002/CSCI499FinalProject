The bug type is a logical error.

The `divisorSubstrings` function contains a logical error in the condition `if (n1 == 0)`. While checking for division by zero is necessary, the current implementation is incorrect. It should also account for divisors that are not a factor, for example, if the digit is "03", the window of length k including the last digit ("3") will not be considered in the current implementation because 03 is 0 and the divisor of 0 is from the number 03 or 3, which is valid to be considered but it will be bypassed. 

The fix will modify the condition and add a check for leading zeros which are not divisible by any value, and thus not a valid divisor.

The following fix has been applied:

```java
class Solution {
    public int divisorSubstrings(int num, int k) {
        String str = String.valueOf(num); 
        int count = 0; 
        for (int i = 0; i <= str.length() - k; i++) 
        {
            String temp = str.substring(i, i + k); 
            if (temp.charAt(0) == '0') { // checks for leading zero
                continue;
            }
            int n1 = Integer.valueOf(temp); 
            if (num % n1 == 0) 
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count; 
    }
}
```
The modified code adds a condition to check for leading zero before converting the substring to an integer and checks for divisibility before incrementing the count.
