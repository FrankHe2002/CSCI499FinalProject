The bug in the provided Java code is due to an incorrect loop termination condition in the `arrangeCoins` method. Since the `long` type is used, replacing `(s <= e)` with `(s < e)` as the loop termination condition and adjusting the return statement can fix the issue. This will allow the binary search algorithm to find the correct number of complete rows for the staircase.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 44.14%) | Memory: 40.7 MB (Top 83.154%)
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long s = 0;
        long e = n;
        while (s < e) {
            long mid = s + (e - s + 1) / 2;  // Adjusting the midpoint calculation
            long coin = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (coin > n) {
                e = mid - 1;
            } else if (coin < n) {
                s = mid;  // Adjusting the increment
            } else return (int) mid;
        }
        return (int) e;
    }
}
```
