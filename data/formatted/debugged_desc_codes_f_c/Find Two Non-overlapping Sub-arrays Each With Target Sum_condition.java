The bug type in the provided code is a logical error. The code should correctly find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of `arr` each with a sum equal to `target`. I will explain the reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug and apply the fix accordingly.

The issue with the code seems to be with the logic used to calculate the sub-arrays of `arr` with a sum equal to `target`. Based on the problem constraints, the logic used in lines 7-27 to calculate the sum and size of the required sub-arrays seems incorrect. The logic should be revised to ensure that the minimum sum of lengths of the two required sub-arrays is returned.

To address this issue, the logic for calculating the minimum sum of lengths of two required sub-arrays needs to be fixed. This can be achieved by updating the sub-array calculation mechanism to ensure accurate length calculation and detection of non-overlapping sub-arrays with a sum equal to the target.

Furthermore, there are logic issues with the initial check for `arr == null` and setting the return value to 0. The correct condition should be `arr == null || arr.length == 0` to return -1 if `arr` is null or empty.

The fix description is as follows:
1. Correct the condition that checks for null or empty `arr` and return -1 accordingly.
2. Update the logic for finding the minimum sum of lengths of the two required sub-arrays to provide accurate results.
3. Maintain the Map to keep track of sub-array sums to optimize the process without calculating the sum of sub-arrays for every combination.

I will now apply the fix to the code:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int minSumOfLengths(int[] arr, int target) {
        if (arr == null || arr.length == 0) return -1;

        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // sum - index
        map.put(0, -1);

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // record preSum and index
            sum += arr[i];
            map.put(sum, i);
        }

        sum = 0;
        int size = arr.length + 1, res = arr.length + 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
            if (map.containsKey(sum - target)) {
                size = Math.min(size, i - map.get(sum - target)); // find the subarray from previous index to current one
            }
            if (map.containsKey(sum + target)) {
                res = Math.min(res, size + map.get(sum + target) - i); // from the current index to next one, this avoids overlap
            }
        }
        return res == arr.length + 1 ? -1 : res;
    }
}
```

The identified bugs have been fixed in the provided code. The revised code now addresses the logical issues and follows the correct logic to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of `arr` with a sum equal to `target`.
