Explanation:
The `isUgly` method has a logical error in the while loop condition. The code attempts to iterate while n equals 1 (`while (n == 1)`), while the intention is to continue iterating until n no longer has 2, 3, or 5 as a prime factor. Therefore, the while condition should be `while (n != 1)`. Additionally, the if conditions need to be updated. The edge case `if (n == 0)` is incorrect; it should be `if (n <= 0)` or `if (n < 1)` due to the constraint and the mathematical definition of an ugly number.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false; // edge case
        while (n != 1) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                n = n / 2;
            } else if (n % 3 == 0) {
                n = n / 3;
            } else if (n % 5 == 0) {
                n = n / 5;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
