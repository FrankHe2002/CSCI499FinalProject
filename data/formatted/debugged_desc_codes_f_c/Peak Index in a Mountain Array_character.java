Problem:
The provided Java code contains an implementation of the `peakIndexInMountainArray` method for finding the index of the peak in a mountain array. 

Explanation:
Upon inspection, the implementation is correct based on the problem requirements and complexity constraints. No issues were identified in the provided code snippet for the `peakIndexInMountainArray` method.

Fix:
No fix is necessary, as the code already meets the stated requirements and constraints.

Final Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {

        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            // if mid < mid next
            if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
            // otherwise it can either peak element or greater element
            else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start; // or we can return end also, bcz both will be on the same value at the time, that's why the loop breaks here.
    }
}
```
