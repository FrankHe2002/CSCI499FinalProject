The bug in the given code occurs due to the loop bounds and array index bounds.

1. The for loop in the `productExceptSelf` method runs from `1 <= i <= n` for creating the `pre` array. However, since array index starts from 0, this will cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. To fix this, the condition should be `i < n`.

2. Similarly, the second for loop creates the `suff` array and the loop condition `n - 2 >= 0` needs to be corrected to `i >= 0`.

The above fixes will resolve the array index bounds issue.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 62.8%) | Memory: 54.05 MB (Top 10.0%)

class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int pre[] = new int[n];
        int suff[] = new int[n];
        pre[0] = 1;
        suff[n - 1] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            pre[i] = pre[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            suff[i] = suff[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
        }

        int ans[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = pre[i] * suff[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
