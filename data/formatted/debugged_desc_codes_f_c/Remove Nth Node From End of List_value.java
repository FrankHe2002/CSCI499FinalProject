Explanation:
The code has multiple issues. The length of the list is calculated incorrectly. The node is not removed correctly in the case of len == n. The solution does not handle additional edge cases like removing the head or removing the last node.

Fix:
The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100%) | Memory: 38.4 MB (Top 62.74%)
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        int length = 0;
        ListNode temp = head;

        while (temp != null) {
            temp = temp.next;
            length++;
        }

        if (length == n)
            return head.next;

        ListNode prev = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < length - n - 1; i++) {
            prev = prev.next;
        }

        if (length - n == 0) {
            head = head.next;
        } else {
            prev.next = prev.next.next;
        }

        return head;
    }
}
```
