The bug type in the given code is a logical error that incorrectly uses a map to sort and create the relative ordering of elements in `arr1`.

The reason for identifying the bug is that the provided code lacks a proper and efficient way to handle a counting sorting mechanism that satisfies the relative ordering of items specified in `arr2`. The map-based counting mechanism along with populating `arr` will not preserve the underlying order as intended.

The fix for the bug is to use an alternative approach. The fix involves creating a separate integer array, `count`, to store the frequency of occurrence of elements in `arr1`. A new array, `result`, is initialized to preserve the relative ordering of items in `arr2` and the end of `arr1`. Finally, the method returns the `result` array.

Below is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (100%) | Memory: 37.8 MB (Top 55%)
class Solution {
    public int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int[] occur = new int[1001];
        int[] res = new int[arr1.length];
        int size = 0;

        for (int val : arr1) {
            occur[val]++;
        }

        for (int val : arr2) {
            while (occur[val]-- != 0)
                res[size++] = val;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 1001; i++) {
            while (occur[i]-- != 0)
                res[size++] = i;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
This revised solution uses the counting sort approach, which respects not only the relative ordering of items in `arr2` but also ensures the elements not present in `arr2` are placed at the end of `arr1` in ascending order.
