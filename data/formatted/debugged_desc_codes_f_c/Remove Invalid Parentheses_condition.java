The buggy code has a logical issue in the `isLeapYear()` method, as well as a missing library import. The logical issue is in the condition for identifying a leap year, and the missing import is causing a compilation error.

Bug Type:
1. Logic Error
2. Compilation Error/Error Import

Reasoning Process for Identifying and Fixing the Bug:
To fix the leap year condition, the correct logic for identifying a leap year is a year being divisible by 4 and not by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400. Additionally, the code is missing imports for the required classes.

Fixing the errors:
1. Import the necessary library `java.util.*` for the `List`, `ArrayList`, and `HashSet`.
2. Correct the condition for the `isLeapYear` method.
3. Fix the syntax error.

Fixed code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        if ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.isLeapYear(2020)); // Output: true
        System.out.println(solution.isLeapYear(2021)); // Output: false
    }
}
```
The code now correctly identifies leap years and successfully imports the necessary library.
