The bug in the provided code is an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The loop tries to access `sentences[i + 2]`, which will exceed the array bounds for any `i` greater than or equal to `sentences.length - 2`. The fix is to remove the addition of 2 and access `sentences[i]` instead, and additionally, to add `+ 1` to include the last index.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 6 ms (Top 54.44%) | Memory: 45.2 MB (Top 33.72%)
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, (sentences[i].split(" ")).length);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
