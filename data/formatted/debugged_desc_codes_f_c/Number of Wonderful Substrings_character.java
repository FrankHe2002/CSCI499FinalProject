Example #6: Bug Type Identification and Fix

Explanation:
The code has a syntax error and incorrect usage of arrays and bitwise operations, leading to an incorrect count of wonderful substrings. The line `count += freq[res;` is missing the closing square bracket `]`. Additionally, the usage of arrays and bitwise operations is incorrect, leading to inaccurate counting of wonderful substrings.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public long wonderfulSubstrings(String word) {
        int n = word.length();
        long count = 0;

        long[] freq = new long[1024]; // Using an array to store frequencies of bitmasks

        freq[0] = 1;
        int res = 0; 

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int mask = (1 << (word.charAt(i) - 'a'));
            res ^= mask; 
            int chkMask = 1;

            count += freq[res];
            for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
                count += freq[chkMask ^ res];
                chkMask <<= 1;
            }

            freq[res]++; 
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
The fix includes:
1. Initializing the array with 1024 elements, ensuring enough space for 10-bit substrings.
2. Fixing the syntax error by correcting `count += freq[res;` to `count += freq[res];`.
3. Using a bitwise XOR operation to toggle bitmasks and evaluate different substring possibilities.
4. Updating the bit shifting operation `chkMask <<= 1;` to check different positions of the different bit.
5. Returning the correct count of wonderful substrings based on valid bitwise operations.
