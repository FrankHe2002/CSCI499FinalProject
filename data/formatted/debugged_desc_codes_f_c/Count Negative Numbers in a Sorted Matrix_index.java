Explanation:
The `countNegatives` method in the provided code has a bug related to accessing elements of the `grid` array, and also the condition used to update the `count` value. 
The bug is at `grid[3].length`, which is an attempt to access the length of the sub-array at index 3, that might not exist. Also, the condition `count += n - c` intended to include `n - c` negative numbers in the count, however, it should only increment count by 1 for negative numbers at a particular row and then move to the next row instead of adding number of negative elements present in row to count. 

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countNegatives(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int c = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int r = m - 1;
        while (r >= 0 && c < n) {
            if (grid[r][c] < 0) {
                r--;
                count++;
            } else {
                c++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
