The bug in the code is with the calculation of the waiting time for each customer. The waiting time should be the time the chef finishes preparing the order minus the customer's arrival time, but the current code is adding the customer's order preparation time. To fix this, we need to subtract the customer's arrival time from the time variable instead of adding the order preparation time.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 8 ms (Top 38.72%) | Memory: 53.7 MB (Top 87.53%)
class Solution {
    public double averageWaitingTime(int[][] customers) {
        double time = 0;
        double waitingTime = 0;

        for (int[] cust : customers) {
            time = Math.max(cust[0], time) + cust[1];
            waitingTime += (time - cust[0]);
        }

        return waitingTime / customers.length;
    }
}
```
