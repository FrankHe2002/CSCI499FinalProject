The identified bug type is "Logical Error."

Explanation:
The original code repeatedly replaces the leftmost occurrence of the substring `part` with an empty string, which may leave other occurrences of `part` behind. For example, given the input string "abab," the part "ab" will only be removed once instead of twice.

Fix:
To ensure all occurrences of `part` are removed, the `replaceFirst` method should be replaced with `replace` to remove all occurrences in each iteration.

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.84%) | Memory: 39.3 MB (Top 94.17%)

class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        while (s.contains(part)) {
            s = s.replace(part, "");
        }
        return s;
    }
}
```
