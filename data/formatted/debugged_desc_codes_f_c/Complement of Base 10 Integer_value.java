The bug type in the given Java code is a logical error. The solution does not correctly calculate the complement of the given integer.

The `bitwiseComplement` function wrongly calculates the complement of the integer. The approach to convert the integer to binary, then flipping the bits one by one, is valid, but the result should be a binary number, not a decimal number.

The fixed solution should involve a different approach to calculate the bitwise complement in binary representation and not directly converting the binary string to an integer.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        int mask = 1 << (Integer.SIZE - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(n));
        mask -= 1;
        return (~n) & mask;
    }
}
```
