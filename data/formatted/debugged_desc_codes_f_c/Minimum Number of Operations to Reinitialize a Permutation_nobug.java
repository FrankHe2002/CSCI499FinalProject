The bug in the given code is in the `reinitializePermutation` method, specifically in the condition `num % (n - 1) == 1`. The condition should check for the remaining steps in the permutation, but it currently checks for the wrong condition.

The fix is to change the condition to `num != 2` to correctly count the non-zero number of operations needed to return the permutation to its initial value.

```java
class Solution {
    public int reinitializePermutation(int n) {
        int ans = 1;
        int num = 2;
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        while (num != 2) {
            ans++;
            num = (num * 2) % (n - 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
