The bug in the given Java code from Example #6 is the failure to check for the value of the node, which is not a good approach as the probability of getting the reference to the node is very less.

Additionally we have called static methods on ref which should be ref[0] to modify the reference and check for the value. 
Keeping this in mind, the appropriate fix will be as follows.

```java
class Solution {
    public final TreeNode getTargetCopy(final TreeNode original, final TreeNode cloned, final TreeNode target) {
        return dfs(cloned, target);
    }

    public static TreeNode dfs(TreeNode root, TreeNode target) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        if (root.val == target.val) return root;
        
        TreeNode left = dfs(root.left, target);
        if (left != null) return left;
        
        TreeNode right = dfs(root.right, target);
        if (right != null) return right;
        
        return null;
    }
}
```
