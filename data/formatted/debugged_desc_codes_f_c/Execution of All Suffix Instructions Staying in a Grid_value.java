The bug in the given Java code is in the indexing logic of the line `int xIndex = startPos[2];` The logic used in the for loop to iterate over the string to execute instructions also needs fixing as the variable `xIndex` should use the index 1 instead of 2 for `startPos`. There is also an issue with array out-of-bounds while handling the `startPos` index.

Fix:
Below is the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] executeInstructions(int n, int[] startPos, String s) {
        int ans[] = new int[s.length()];

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int countMoves = 0;
            int yIndex = startPos[0];
            int xIndex = startPos[1];  // corrected index to be 1
            for (int j = i; j < s.length(); j++) {  // change index of startPos from 2 to 1
                // other code remains the same
                // ...
            }
            ans[i] = countMoves;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
