The bug type in the provided buggy Java code is a logical error. The code in the provided minMoves function fails to calculate the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal. It incorrectly calculates the difference between each element and the minimum element, but it should be the difference between each element and the minimum element multiplied by the number of elements.

The fix is to change the line `count += nums[i] - min;` with `count += nums[i] - min;` to `count += nums[i] - min;` to correctly calculate the total difference.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i : nums)
            min = Math.min(i, min);

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            count += nums[i] - min;
        }
        return count * nums.length;
    }
}
```
