The original code is an implementation of a sliding window algorithm to solve the Maximum Erasure Value problem. The objective is to find the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray containing unique elements.

Upon closer inspection, there is a bug in the array indexing used for the nmap array. The array nmap should be able to store counts of all positive integers in the input array `nums`, but it's initialized with a fixed length of 10001, which is not appropriate for all possible values within the given constraints. This may lead to 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException' if the `nums` array contains values beyond the predefined limit.

To fix the issue, the array length of nmap should be dynamically determined based on the maximum value (maxVal) in the input array. This will ensure that all elements in the input are processed without the risk of array index overflow.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 7 ms (Top 95.0+) | Memory: 59.10 MB (Top 35.8%)

class Solution {
    public int maximumUniqueSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int maxVal = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, num);
        }
        int[] nmap = new int[maxVal + 1];
        int total = 0, best = 0;
        for (int left = 0, right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            nmap[nums[right]]++;
            total += nums[right];
            while (nmap[nums[right]] > 1) {
                nmap[nums[left]]--;
                total -= nums[left++];
            }
            best = Math.max(best, total);
        }
        return best;
    }
}
```

The fixed code correctly identifies and fixes the issue related to using the right dimensions for the nmap array, ensuring that all unique elements are taken into account without running into indexing issues.
