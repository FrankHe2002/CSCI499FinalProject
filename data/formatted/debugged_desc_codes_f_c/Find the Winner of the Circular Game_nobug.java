Explanation:
The current implementation of the loop doesn't correctly rotate the list by a fixed amount, thereby potentially adding a friend multiple times during the looping process. Additionally, the usage of LinkedList adds a lot of overhead, slowing down the code in terms of both time and space complexity. A better approach is to use a mathematical analysis that finds the safe position without simulating the game, improving the time complexity to O(n).

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100%) | Memory: 36.1 MB (Top 99.9%)

class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        int safePosition = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            safePosition = (safePosition + k) % i;
        }
        return safePosition + 1;
    }
}
```
