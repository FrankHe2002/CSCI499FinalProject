The bug type in the provided Java code for the canDistribute function is related to a logical error that causes potential miscounts in fulfilling customer order quantities. The given recursive implementation lacks an essential check, leading to incorrect results.

The identified logical errors in the given Sample #6 can be fixed by changing the inner loop condition to `dist[i] >= quantity[j]` and replacing `Arrays` with `i` in the condition.

The fixed code with minimal changes is as follows:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public boolean canDistribute(int[] nums, int[] quantity) {

        // Use a map to count the numbers, ex: nums:[5,7,4,7,4,7] -> {5:1, 7:3, 4:2}
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Turn values of the map into array, ex: {5:1, 7:3, 4:2} -> [1, 3, 2]
        int[] dist = new int[freq.size()];
        int idx = 0;
        for (int f : freq.values()) {
            dist[idx++] = f;
        }

        // Fullfill the quantities from the biggest quantity to the smallest.
        // If the bigger quantity can't be filled, the program will stop as early as possible.
        Arrays.sort(quantity);
        return rec(dist, quantity, quantity.length - 1);
    }

    // try to fullfill the j-th order quantity
    private boolean rec(int[] dist, int[] quantity, int j) {

        // stop condition. We've fulfilled all the order quantities.
        if (j == - 1) {
            return true;
        }

        Set<Integer> used = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < dist.length; ++ i) {

            // Use a set to make sure that
            //   we don't distribute from the same amount to this j-th order for more than once.
            // With this check, the program reduces from 97ms to 25 ms.
            if (dist[i] >= quantity[j] && used.add(i)) {
                dist[i] -= quantity[j];
                if (rec(dist, quantity, j - 1)) {
                    return true;
                }
                dist[i] += quantity[j];
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
