The given code is intended to find the number of good substrings in a string. A good substring is defined as a substring with no repeated characters. However, it seems like the code has some issues.

Explanation:
The code only verifies the condition for good substrings using the last three characters from i - 2 to i. It should check for good substrings for every substring of length three from the given string.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countGoodSubstrings(String s) {
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char first = s.charAt(i - 2);
            char second = s.charAt(i - 1);
            char third = s.charAt(i);
            if (first != second && first != third && second != third) {
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
