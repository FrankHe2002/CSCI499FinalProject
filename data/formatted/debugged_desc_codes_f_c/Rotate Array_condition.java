The bug in the provided Java code is in the `reverse` method. The condition in the `reverse` method, i.e., `while (start >= end)`, is incorrect. It's an infinite loop as `start` will never be greater than or equal to `end`.

The bug type is a logical error in the reverse method's condition.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the `reverse` method to `while (start < end)`.

The revised and fixed code using minimal changes is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
    }

    public static void reverse(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
