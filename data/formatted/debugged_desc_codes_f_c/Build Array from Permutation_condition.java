The bug in the provided Java code is a logical error. The first for loop in the buildArray method has an incorrect equation for calculating the new value of nums[i]. The second for loop incorrectly divides each element in nums by n. The last loop condition should be `< n`, not `<= n`.

The logical fix for the bugs in the buildArray method is to correct the equations used to calculate the new value of nums[i] and fix the loop condition of the last for loop.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] buildArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = nums[i] + n * (nums[nums[i]] % n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = nums[i] / n;

        return nums;
    }
}
```
