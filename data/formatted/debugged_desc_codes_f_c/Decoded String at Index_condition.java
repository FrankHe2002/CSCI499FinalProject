The bug in the given code is that the variable `sz` that stores the size of the decoded string is declared as `long`, but when performing the `sz /= (s.charAt(i) - '0');` operation, the variable `sz` can be (erroneously) casted to `int`, leading to incorrect results for large test cases.

Additionally, the logic for 0-indexing the string length and misplacement of the modulus operation can lead to incorrect results.

The fix for these issues involves changing the data type of `sz` to `long`, handling the edge case when `k` is zero, and adjusting the modulus operation logic at the end of the loop to ensure that the value of `k` is correctly computed for its 0-based index in the string.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public String decodeAtIndex(String s, int k) {
        long sz = 0;
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) { // total length
            sz = Character.isDigit(ch) ? sz * (ch - '0') : sz + 1;
        }
        --k; // make it 0 index based.
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i))) {
                sz /= (s.charAt(i) - '0');
                k %= sz;
            } else if (sz == 0 || k == 0) { // handle the edge case when k is 0
                return "" + s.charAt(i);
            } else {
                sz--;
            }
        }
        return null; // Handle error case - this line is not reachable if logic is correct.
    }
}
```
