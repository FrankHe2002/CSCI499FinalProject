The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The robotSim function contains an error in the logic to determine the direction for the robot's move. The directions seem to be problematic.

* The `dir` variable mod 4 is done to align the robot's direction within the range of 0 to 3.
* The adjustment of direction when `i` is -2 and -1 seems to be incorrect.
* The condition to update the coordinates while moving in a particular direction contains a logical mistake and the sequence of operations seem incorrect as well.

The fix for the robotSim function includes addressing these logical errors. The correct adjustments according to directions, as well as moving forward and updating coordinates, should be applied to calculate the maximum Euclidean distance correctly.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 162 ms (Top 8.26%) | Memory: 66.8 MB (Top 51.38%)
class Solution {
    public int robotSim(int[] commands, int[][] obstacles) {
        int dir = 0; // states 0north-1east-2south-3west
        int farthestSofar = 0;

        int xloc = 0;
        int yloc = 0;

        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] obs : obstacles) {
            set.add(obs[0] + "," + obs[1]);
        }

        int steps;

        for (int command : commands) {
            if (command == -1) {  // turn right 90
                dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
            } else if (command == -2) {  // turn left 90
                dir = (dir + 3) % 4;  // equivalent to dir = (dir - 1 + 4) % 4;
            } else {  // move forward
                for (int k = 0; k < command; k++) {
                    int nextX = xloc, nextY = yloc;
                    if (dir == 0) {
                        nextY++;
                    } else if (dir == 1) {
                        nextX++;
                    } else if (dir == 2) {
                        nextY--;
                    } else {
                        nextX--;
                    }
                    if (set.contains(nextX + "," + nextY)) {
                        break;
                    }
                    xloc = nextX;
                    yloc = nextY;
                    farthestSofar = Math.max(farthestSofar, xloc * xloc + yloc * yloc);
                }
            }
        }
        return farthestSofar;
    }
}
```

The changes made in the fixed code include:
1. Adjust the direction based on the commands passed to the robot.
2. Simulate the forward movement of the robot based on the direction while checking for any obstacles to update the coordinates.
3. Calculate the maximum Euclidean distance correctly.
