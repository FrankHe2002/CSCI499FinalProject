The bug type in the provided code is a logical error.

Explanation:
The `subsetSum` method has a logical error. The bug seems to be syntactical, but it is a logical error as it is related to the sum formula. The problem occurs in the section where the values are being assigned to the `dp` array based on the sum. The construction of the `dp` table is incorrect.

Fix:
The correction is made in the expression within the if-else conditional statement inside the `subsetSum` method where we add two values to the `dp` array. Adding the missing parenthesis to the formula will address the bug, correcting the logic of how the array is populated with values.

Fixed code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTargetSumWays(int[] nums, int target) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            sum += i;
        }
        if (target > sum || target < -sum || ((target + sum) & 1) != 0) return 0;
        return subsetSum(nums, (target + sum) / 2);
    }

    private int subsetSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[][] dp = new int[nums.length + 1][target + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < target + 1; j++) {
                if (nums[i-1] <= j) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[nums.length][target];
    }
}
```
