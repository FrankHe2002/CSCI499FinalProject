The code provided has a faulty implementation of the mostCompetitive function. The buggy part lies in the while loop condition and the post-decrement of variable j. The while loop condition includes an incorrect check for 'j <= 0' and a wrong condition for filling the stack array. Additionally, indexing seems to be incorrect. I've made the necessary changes and included comments below for clarification.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] mostCompetitive(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] stack = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Modified while loop condition and increment condition.
            while (j > 0 && stack[j - 1] > nums[i] && j + nums.length - i > k) {
                j--;  
            }

            //Changed condition inside if statement.
            if (j < k) {
                stack[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return stack;
    }
}
```
The buggy code has now been fixed.
