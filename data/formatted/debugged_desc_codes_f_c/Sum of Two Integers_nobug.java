Explanation:
The `getSum` method incorrectly uses the `Integer.sum` method, which is against the instruction of not using the operators + and -. The fix to is implement the sum of the two integers without using the + or - operators.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {

    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int carry = a & b;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = carry << 1;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
