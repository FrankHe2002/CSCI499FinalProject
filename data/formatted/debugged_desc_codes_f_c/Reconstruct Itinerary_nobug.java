The bug in the provided Java code is in the DFS algorithm implementation for the finding of itinerary. The `PriorityQueue` is incorrectly defined for `String` objects. Since `PriorityQueue` is not given a comparator to handle the ordering of strings (airports), the lexical ordering requirement is not being considered as intended.

To fix the bug, a custom comparator needs to be provided for sorting the destinations of each departure airport in lexicographical order.

The `dfs` method implementation is also incorrect, as it doesn't handle all possible itineraries by selecting airports based on lexical order. The lexical ordering requirement mentioned in the problem statement is not respected.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes applied:

```java
class Solution {
    LinkedList<String> res = new LinkedList<>();

    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {
        HashMap<String, PriorityQueue<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (List<String> ticket : tickets) {
            String a = ticket.get(0);
            String b = ticket.get(1);
            if (!map.containsKey(a)) {
                PriorityQueue<String> temp = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.naturalOrder());
                map.put(a, temp);
            }
            map.get(a).add(b);
        }

        dfs("JFK", map);
        return res;
    }

    private void dfs(String departure, HashMap<String, PriorityQueue<String>> map) {
        PriorityQueue<String> arrivals = map.get(departure);
        while (arrivals != null && !arrivals.isEmpty()) {
            dfs(arrivals.poll(), map);
        }
        res.addFirst(departure);
    }
}
```
This code changes how the priorities are ordered by providing a custom comparator for natural ordering and applying it while adding destinations to the map. The revisions to the initial algorithm are kept to a minimum, focusing only on addressing the identified bugs.
