The bug in the canMakePaliQueries method is that the odd count of characters in the substring's map is checked directly against the allowed maximum changes k, but it doesn't consider the number of characters already available to be changed. An efficient fix is to compare the difference between count and k (considering k as the maximum number of character changes allowed) with 2.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> canMakePaliQueries(String s, int[][] queries) {
        List<Boolean> list = new ArrayList<>();

        int n = s.length();
        int[][] map = new int[n + 1][26];

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++)
                map[i + 1][j] = map[i][j];

            map[i + 1][s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        for (int[] q : queries) {
            int l = q[0];
            int r = q[1];
            int k = q[2];
            int count = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
                count += (map[r + 1][i] - map[l][i]) % 2;

            list.add(count / 2 <= k);
        }

        return list;
    }
}
```
