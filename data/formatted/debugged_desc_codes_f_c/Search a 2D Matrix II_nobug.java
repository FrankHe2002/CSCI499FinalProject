The bug is in the searchMatrix function, particularly in the initial binary search to find the row where the target value might be located. The condition `lo + 1 < hi` impacts the correct index calculation and retrieval. The code must be refactored in order to maintain the correct boundaries for row and column index, accounting for zero-based indexing of array elements.

A review of the constraints and the array structure reveals that the binary search approach is valid. However, the current implementation handles the rows and columns differently, leading to a fault. The correct approach is to account for zero-based index adjustment affecting the row and column ranges.

The code should be refactored to consider zero-based indexing as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        // Check for an empty matrix
        if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int rows = matrix.length;
        int cols = matrix[0].length;
        
        // Initial boundaries
        int row = rows - 1;
        int col = 0;
        
        // Search from lower left to upper right
        while (row >= 0 && col < cols) {
            if (matrix[row][col] > target) {
                row--; // Move to the upper row
            } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) {
                col++; // Move to the right column
            } else {
                return true; // It's a match
            }
        }
        
        return false; // Target not found
    }
}
```

This refactored code uses the concept of a search-space reducing hybrid between Linear Search and Binary Search, which properly accesses the matrix's rows and columns without the need for additional space or extensive computational resources.
