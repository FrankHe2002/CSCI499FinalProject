Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for counting the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds. The current implementation returns the count of perfect squares less than or equal to n, not the correct count of bulbs turned on.

The correct implementation involves finding the number of factors for each number from 1 to n (inclusive), as each number has an even number of factors (except for perfect squares), meaning the bulb will be off. For every perfect square, the number of factors is odd, meaning the bulb will be on.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return (int)Math.sqrt(n);
    }
}
```

The code has already implemented a brute force logic that correctly returns the expected result. Therefore, there are no identified bug or error to fix in this implementation.
