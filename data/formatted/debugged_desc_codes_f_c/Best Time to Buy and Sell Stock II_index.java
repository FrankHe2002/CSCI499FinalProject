The bug present in the provided Java code is that the condition `prices[i + 1] > prices[0]` is comparing with `prices[0]` instead of `prices[i]`, which is not accurate. Also, the loop is not iterating properly for every day in the prices array.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length, profit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (prices[i + 1] > prices[i]) {
                profit += prices[i + 1] - prices[i];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
