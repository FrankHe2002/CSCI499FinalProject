The bug in the provided Java code is a logical error in the inner loop condition of the maximumWealth function. The condition `i > accounts.length` is incorrect because it will initially evaluate to false, and thus the inner loop will never execute. The correct loop condition should be `i < accounts.length`.

Another logical error is that the variable `res` is initialized to 0, which will never correctly reflect the maximum wealth since minimum wealth is greater than or equal to 0. Since the wealth in the account is bounded by the values 1 to 100, `res` should be initialized to the minimum possible wealth value (which is 1).

The fixed code can be shown below:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms | Memory: 38.8 MB
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int temp = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                temp += accounts[i][j];
            }
            res = Math.max(res, temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
