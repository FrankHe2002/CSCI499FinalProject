The identified bug is that the code does not handle the "./" operation, which should leave the current folder as is. This results in an incorrect count of the number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after which the changes folder operations have been performed.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 58.89%) | Memory: 2.7 MB (Top 94.57%)
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String[] logs) {
        var stack = new Stack<String>();
        for (var log : logs) {
            if (log.equals("../")) {
                if (!stack.empty()) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            } else if (log.equals("./")) {
                // Do nothing as the operation does not change the current folder
            } else {
                stack.push(log);
            }
        }
        return stack.size();
    }
}
```
