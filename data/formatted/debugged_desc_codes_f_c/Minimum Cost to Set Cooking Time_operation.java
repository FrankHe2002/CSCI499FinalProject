The bug type in this Java code is a logical error.

The given code has logical problems and measured parameters. The `min` variable is used to calculate the minutes, but it incorrectly gets decremented when the value of `min` exceeds 99. The `min` variable stores the value obtainted when the target seconds are greater than 5960 and not 6000 as the comment inside code refers to. The code also prematurely assigns a value to 'tar' leading to an incorrect calculation. There's no need to calculate the moves again based on the calculated value of `tar`.

The logic to calculate the minimum cost is accurate, but the way the cooking minutes and seconds are calculated is incorrect. Also, the usage of a char array is unnecessarily complicated.

The fixed Java code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 88.7%) | Memory: 39.44 MB (Top 55.0%)

class Solution {
    public int minCostSetTime(int startAt, int moveCost, int pushCost, int tar) {
        int tarMinutes = tar / 60;
        int tarSeconds = tar % 60;
        int minCost = (moveCost + pushCost) * 4;

        // Check and adjust minutes and seconds
        if (tarMinutes > 99) {
            tarMinutes = 99;
            tarSeconds = 59;
        }
        
        while (tarMinutes >= 0) {
            tar = tarMinutes * 100 + tarSeconds;
            char[] arr = String.valueOf(tar).toCharArray();
            int sameMove = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
                if (arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) {
                    sameMove++;
                }
            }
            if (startAt == arr[0] - '0') {
                minCost = Math.min(minCost, pushCost * arr.length + moveCost * (arr.length - 1 - sameMove));
            } else {
                minCost = Math.min(minCost, pushCost * arr.length + moveCost * (arr.length - sameMove));
            }
            tarMinutes--;
            tarSeconds += 60;
        }
        return minCost;
    }
}
```
