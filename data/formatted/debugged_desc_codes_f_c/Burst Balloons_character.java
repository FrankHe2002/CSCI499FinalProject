The bug type found based on the code in Example 5 is a syntax error. Upon reviewing the given code, there is an error in the line `temp[temp.length - 1 = 1;` which is missing a closing bracket to access the last index of the temp array.

The line `temp[temp.length - 1 = 1;` should be replaced with `temp[temp.length - 1] = 1;` to correctly access the last index of the temp array and set it to 1.

The corrected code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // adding 1 to the front and back
        int[] temp = new int[n + 2];
        temp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < temp.length - 1; i++) {
            temp[i] = nums[i - 1];
        }
        temp[temp.length - 1] = 1;
        nums = temp;

        // memoization
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        for (int[] row : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        }

        // result
        return f(1, n, nums, dp);
    }

    int f(int i, int j, int[] a, int[][] dp) {
        if (i > j) return 0;
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];

        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int n = i; n <= j; n++) {
            int coins = a[i - 1] * a[n] * a[j + 1] + f(i, n - 1, a, dp) + f(n + 1, j, a, dp);
            max = Math.max(max, coins);
        }
        return dp[i][j] = max;
    }
}
```

The changes were made in the original code to correct the syntax error identified. No reorganization or optimization of the code was done since it was mentioned not to change the organization of the code.
