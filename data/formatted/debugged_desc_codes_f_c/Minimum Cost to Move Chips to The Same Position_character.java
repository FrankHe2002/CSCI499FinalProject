The error is that the code is not considering the actual costs but only the positions of the chips, which determine whether the cost is even or odd. To fix this, the code must account for the actual cost of moving the chips according to the rules provided.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostToMoveChips(int[] position) {
        int even = 0;
        int odd = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
            if (position[i] % 2 == 0) {
                even++;
            } else {
                odd++;
            }
        }
        return Math.min(even, odd);
    }
}
```
