There is a logical error in the lengthOfLongestSubstring method, which finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The provided code has a bug where it resets the 'i' index in the inner loop, which is incorrect. The solution should not reset the loop index because it can skip multiple characters during the iteration. Additionally, the hash map is cleared every time the current character is repeated, which causes loss of information about past characters in the string. These issues result in an incorrect calculation of the longest substring without repeating characters.

The fix is to modify the logic for advancing the 'i' index and to remove the unnecessary clearing of the hash map. By doing so, it ensures that the algorithm checks all unique substrings without skipping any characters and retains the information about previous characters.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> hash = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
            if (hash.containsKey(s.charAt(j))) {
                i = Math.max(hash.get(s.charAt(j)), i);
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, j - i + 1);
            hash.put(s.charAt(j), j + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
