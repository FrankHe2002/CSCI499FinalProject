The bug in the provided Java code is that the while loop continues until `answer * answer` is less than or equal to `x`, which results in overshooting the correct square root of `x`. The square root must be found without overshooting it.

The fix is to change the loop condition to `(answer + 1) * (answer + 1) <= x`, ensuring that the loop runs until the square of the next number crosses `x`. Additionally, the final return statement should be removed from the subtraction operation.

class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        long answer = 0;
        while ((answer + 1) * (answer + 1) <= x) {
            answer += 1;
        }
        return (int) answer;
    }
}
