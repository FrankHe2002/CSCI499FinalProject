The bug in the code is in the Solution constructor, more specifically in the line `ll.add(nums[2]);`. This line should be adding the current number in nums, not the specific number at index 2. Changing this line to `ll.add(nums[i]);` will fix the bug. Additionally, there's a minor issue in the pick function where we should be returning the index value `n` after the correct number is found. Below is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {
    ArrayList<Integer> ll;

    public Solution(int[] nums) {
        ll = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            ll.add(nums[i]);
        }
    }

    public int pick(int target) {
        double a = Math.random();
        int n = (int) (a * this.ll.size());
        while (this.ll.get(n) != target) {
            a = Math.random();
            n = (int) (a * this.ll.size());
        }
        return n;
    }
}
```
