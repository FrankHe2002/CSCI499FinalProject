The bug is as follows:

In the dfs method, the code to check for the case when the neighbor node is not infected should also consider the case when the neighbor node is contained (value 2). As it stands, the code only checks for the uninfected (value 0) case to increment the wall count and add the uninfected node to the region.

The fix is to change the if condition in the dfs method to also include checking for the case when the neighbor node is contained.

The fixed code is:

```java
private void dfs(int i, int j, Region reg, int[][] grid, boolean[][] visited, boolean[][] uninfectedVis, int m, int n) {
    visited[i][j] = true;
    reg.addInfected(i, j);

    for (int[] dir : DIR) {
        int di = i + dir[0];
        int dj = j + dir[1];

        // continue if out of bounds, contained, or already visited
        if (di < 0 || dj < 0 || di == m || dj == n || grid[di][dj] == 2 || visited[di][dj])
            continue;

        if (grid[di][dj] == 0) {
            reg.wallsRequired++;
            if (!uninfectedVis[di][dj]) {
                uninfectedVis[di][dj] = true;
                reg.addUninfected(di, dj);
            }
        } else if (grid[di][dj] == 1) {
            dfs(di, dj, reg, grid, visited, uninfectedVis, m, n);
        }
    }
}
```
