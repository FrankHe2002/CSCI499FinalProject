The fix to the original buggy Java code is to correct the loop condition that iterates n times and add the missing semicolon after the loop. Additionally, the logic to return a string with characters occurring an odd number of times is not achieved. I will fix that as well and ensure the correct logic for generating the string.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String generateTheString(int n) {
        String s = "";
        String string = "a";
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            s += string;
        }
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return s + "b";
        }
        return s + "a";
    }
}
```
