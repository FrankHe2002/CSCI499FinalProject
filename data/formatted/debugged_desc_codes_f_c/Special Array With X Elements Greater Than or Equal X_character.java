The bug type in the provided buggy Java code is a syntax error.

The process of identification and fixing the bug involves the following steps:
1. Identify the type of bug based on the symptoms and expected behavior.
2. Review the code for syntax errors or logical flaws.
3. Make minimal changes to fix the issue without altering the code's structure.

For the provided code, the bug is a syntax error due to the missing closing brackets and the incorrect syntax in its for loop statements.

The following is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 88.84%) | Memory: 42.3 MB (Top 22.19%)
class Solution {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        int x = nums.length;
        int[] counts = new int[x + 1];

        for (int elem : nums)
            if (elem >= x)
                counts[x]++;
            else
                counts[elem]++;

        int res = 0;
        for (int i = counts.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            res += counts[i];
            if (res == i)
                return i;
        }

        return - 1;
    }
}
```

The fixed code adds the missing closing square brackets to the `res` and `counts[i]` statements, fixing the syntax error.
