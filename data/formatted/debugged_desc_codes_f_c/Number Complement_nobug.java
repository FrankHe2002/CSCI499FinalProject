Explanation:
The findComplement method doesn't correctly calculate the complement of the input integer. It attempts to calculate the complement by iterating through the binary representation of the input and reversing the bits without considering the actual complement of the number. The fix is to directly calculate the complement of the number by flipping all the 0's to 1's and 1's to 0's using binary manipulation.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int highestOneBit = Integer.highestOneBit(num);
        int mask = (highestOneBit << 1) - 1;
        return ~num & mask;
    }
}
```
