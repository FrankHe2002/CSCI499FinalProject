Bug Type:
Logical error

Reasoning:
The implementation appears to follow a sliding window approach where the misMatchCount is calculated and updated for each window of the string until a valid binary string is formed. However, the logic used to compute the misMatchCount is incorrect, and the use of sliding window approach is unclear.

Fix:
Update the approach to correctly calculate the minimum number of type-2 operations needed so that the string becomes alternating. This can be done by using a straightforward algorithm that keeps track of the length of alternating subsequences.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String s) {
        int ans1 = 0, ans2 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) - '0' != i % 2) ans1++;
            else ans2++;
        }
        return Math.min(ans1, ans2);
    }
}
```
