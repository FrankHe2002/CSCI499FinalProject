The bug in the given Java code is in the `countKDifference` method. The implementation doesn't fully cover the requirement for finding the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j such that `|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k`. The code doesn't account for the condition "i < j" and doesn't directly count the pairs meeting the criteria. The calculations of `res` and the usage of the `Map` structure are also incorrect.

The fix requires refactoring the logic to accurately count the pairs and their differences. Below is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 9 ms (Top 51.83%) | Memory: 44.1 MB (Top 44.46%)
class Solution {
    public int countKDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int res = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        for (int num : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.containsKey(num - k)) {
                res += map.get(num) * map.get(num - k);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
