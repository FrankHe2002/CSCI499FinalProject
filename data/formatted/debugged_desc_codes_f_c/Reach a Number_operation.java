Explanation: 
The original code has a logical error and an incorrect return statement. The first while loop continually adds steps to sum without considering if the target is reached, leading to an infinite loop. Additionally, the second while loop unnecessarily executes when it's already checked in the first loop. The return statement `return steps * 1;` also incorrectly multiplies `steps` by 1. 

Fix:
To fix the logical error, it should account for different scenarios where steps are added. The updated solution checks if the sum exceeds the target by an even or odd number to reach the destination. The return statement should simply return `steps`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        int sum = 0, steps = 0;
        if (target == 0) return 0;
        target = Math.abs(target);
        while (sum < target || (sum - target) % 2 != 0) {
            steps++;
            sum += steps;
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
```
