The bug in the given Java code is causing a syntax error due to a misplaced parenthesis that results in incorrect logic for identifying arithmetic triplets.

The issue is caused by the condition `if (map[num >= 3) result += 1;`. The expression `map[num >= 3` is not only incorrectly positioned within the statement but also logically incorrect.
The condition should be associated with the comparison `num >= 3` instead of including it within the `map` array indexing.

The fix is to:
1. Correctly position the condition `num >= 3`.
2. Change the condition operation to use an equality check operator (`==`) instead of attempting to assign it.

Additionally, the method name should be updated to match the provided code description (arithmeticTriplets).

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 98.25%) | Memory: 42.8 MB (Top 15.70%)

class Solution {
    public int arithmeticTriplets(int[] nums, int diff) {
        int result = 0;
        int[] map = new int[201];

        for (int num : nums) {
            map[num] = 1;

            if (num - diff >= 0) {
                map[num] += map[num - diff];
            }

            if (num >= 3) {
                result += 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
