The issue identified is that the implementation of the postorder traversal of the binary tree is incorrect. The postorder traversal should be left-right-root.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 */
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

class Solution {
    List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<Integer> postorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        traversal(root);
        return res;
    }

    public void traversal(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return;
        traversal(root.left);
        traversal(root.right);
        res.add(root.val);
    }
}
```

The problem was not the implementation of the traversal function, which is correct, but the missing TreeNode definition that was causing an error during compilation. I moved the TreeNode class definition into the code for a standalone solution.
