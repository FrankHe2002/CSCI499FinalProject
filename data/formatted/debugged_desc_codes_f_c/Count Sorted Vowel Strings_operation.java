Bug type: 
1. Logical error in computation
2. Assignment precedence error

Reasoning:
1. The given code aims to compute the number of strings of length n consisting only of vowels that are lexicographically sorted. However, the integers a, e, i, o, and u are incorrectly computed in the for loop. There is also an error in the computation logic. It seems that the addition is not being performed correctly.
2. Moreover, an assignment precedence error is present in the expressions involving addition and modulo operations.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countVowelStrings(int n) {
        int a = 1, e = 1, i = 1, o = 1, u = 1;
        for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {
            int tempA = a, tempE = e, tempI = i, tempO = o;
            a = tempA;
            e = tempA + tempE;
            i = tempA + tempE + tempI;
            o = tempA + tempE + tempI + tempO;
            u = tempA + tempE + tempI + tempO + u;
        }
        return a + e + i + o + u;
    }
}
```
