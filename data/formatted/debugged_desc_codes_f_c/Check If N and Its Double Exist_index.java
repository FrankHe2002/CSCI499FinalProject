The identified bug types:
1. Logical error (addition instead of multiplication)
2. Syntax error (missing semicolon)
3. Off-by-one error
4. Logical error (incorrect arithmetic operator)
5. Logical error (incorrect conditional statement)

Reasoning process:
1. `fixMax` function - identified the incorrect loop condition attempting to access an index out of the array's bounds. It was resolved by changing the loop condition.
2. `repeatChar` function - identified the missing semicolon at the end of the statement inside the loop. It was resolved by adding a semicolon at the end.
3. `multiply` function - identified incorrect operation. It was resolved by changing addition operation to multiplication.
4. `isEven` function - identified incorrect condition. It was resolved by changing the condition to check for even numbers.
5. `isLeapYear` function - identified incorrect implementation of the leap year condition. It was resolved by adjusting the condition to correctly identify leap years.

Given code - the identified code has several issues, such as the use of undefined variable "Solution", and partial implementation of functionality. To resolve this, we will:
- Correct the logical errors and syntax errors present in the code.
- Amend any off-by-one errors.
- Ensure proper variable usage and correct any conditional statements.
- Provide the complete functionality as per the code description for the checkIfExist method.

Code with fixes:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findMax(int[] nums) {
        int max = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > max) {
                max = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }

    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
            result += c;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    public boolean isEven(int num) {
        return num % 2 == 0;
    }

    public boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        return (year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);
    }

    public boolean checkIfExist(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
                if (arr[j] == 2 * arr[i] || arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
