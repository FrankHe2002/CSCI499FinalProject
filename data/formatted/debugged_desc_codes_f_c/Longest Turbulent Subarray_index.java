The bug in the code is within the indexing when calculating the initial difference and when determining if k is even or odd. We can fix this by changing the initial value of `r` from 1 to 2 to properly calculate the initial difference and also initializing `diff` to `arr[0] - arr[1]` to set the initial difference based on the first two array elements. Additionally, we should fix the logic for checking if `k` is even or odd when comparing elements.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTurbulenceSize(int[] arr) {
        if (arr.length == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int l = 0, r = 2; // Change the initial value of r to 2
        int diff = arr[0] - arr[1]; // Set initial difference based on first two elements
        int max;
        if (diff == 0) {
            l = 1;
            r = 1;
            max = 1;
        } else {
            l = 0;
            r = 1;
            max = 2;
        }
        for (int i = 1; r < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            int nextdiff = arr[i] - arr[i + 1];
            if ((diff < 0 && nextdiff > 0) || (diff >= 0 && nextdiff < 0)) { // Adjust logic for checking even/odd based on k
                r++;
            } else if (nextdiff == 0) {
                l = i + 1;
                r = i + 1;
            } else {
                l = i;
                r = i + 1;
            }
            diff = nextdiff;
            max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
