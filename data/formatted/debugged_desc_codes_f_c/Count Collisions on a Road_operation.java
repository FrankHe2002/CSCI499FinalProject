Bug Type: Syntax Error

There is a syntax error in the provided Java code. The issue is at the line `int right = directions.length() / 1;`, which appears to be an unintentional division operation. 

Fix:
- Change `int right = directions.length() / 1;` to `int right = directions.length() - 1;`, which will properly populate the `right` variable with the index of the last character in the `directions` string.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countCollisions(String directions) {
        int left = 0, right = directions.length() - 1;

        while (left < directions.length() && directions.charAt(left) == 'L') {
            left++;
        }

        while (right >= 0 && directions.charAt(right) == 'R') {
            right--;
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (directions.charAt(i) != 'S') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
