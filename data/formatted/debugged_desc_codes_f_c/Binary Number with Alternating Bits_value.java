The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The function `hasAlternatingBits` has an incorrect implementation. It attempts to check for alternating bits but does not correctly handle the bitwise comparison. The initial setting of the `flag` variable doesn't seem to align with the logic for determining alternating bits. The `bin` method also has incorrect logic and does not handle the comparison of adjacent bits.

The correct implementation should compare the bits of the input integer `n` to determine if it has alternating bits. An efficient way to check for alternating bits is to compare each bit with its adjacent bit using bitwise operations.

To fix this bug, the approach should be revised to directly check if the bits are alternating without involving recursive calls, and should handle the logic to correctly determine if the bits are alternating.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
        int prevBit = n & 1;
        n = n >> 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            int currBit = n & 1;
            if (prevBit == currBit) {
                return false;
            }
            prevBit = currBit;
            n = n >> 1;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
