The bug in the given Java code is in the `maximumGap` function. The issue is with the loop where the `res` value is being calculated. The `Math.abs` function is used for finding the absolute difference, but the indices `i` and `i - 1` can lead to negative differences, which would not represent the actual maximum difference in the array.

The fix is to update the calculation inside the loop to compare the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`, ensuring non-negative differences even after sorting the array.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maximumGap(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int res = 0;
        if (nums.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            res = Math.max(nums[i + 1] - nums[i], res);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
