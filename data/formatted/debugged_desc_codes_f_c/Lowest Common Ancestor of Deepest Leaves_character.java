The bug in the provided Java code is found within the function `lcaDeepestLeaves`. The code uses recursion to find the depth of the deepest leaves and their common ancestor. However, there is an issue with the depth calculation and the processing of each node for finding the common ancestor, resulting in the incorrect output.

The issue can be resolved by adjusting the implementation of the depth calculation and finding the lowest common ancestor. 

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root).node;
    }
    
    private Result dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return new Result(null, 0);
        }
        
        Result left = dfs(node.left);
        Result right = dfs(node.right);
        
        if (left.depth > right.depth) {
            return new Result(left.node, left.depth + 1);
        } else if (left.depth < right.depth) {
            return new Result(right.node, right.depth + 1);
        } else {
            return new Result(node, left.depth + 1);
        }
    }
}

class Result {
    TreeNode node;
    int depth;
  
    Result(TreeNode node, int depth) {
        this.node = node;
        this.depth = depth;
    }
}
```
In this fixed code:
The `lcaDeepestLeaves` function calls a new helper function `dfs` to calculate the depth and find the lowest common ancestor which is then returned directly.
The `dfs` function performs depth-first search to find the lowest common ancestor, and the depth of the current node which is returned as a `Result` object.
The `Result` class is used to store the node and its depth for better readability.

This updated implementation fixes the bug and should work correctly for the stated problem.
