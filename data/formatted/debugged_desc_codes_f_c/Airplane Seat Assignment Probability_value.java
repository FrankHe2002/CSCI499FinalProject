The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The given code returns the incorrect probability that the nth person gets their own seat. It always returns `1/2` regardless of the input `n`.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows:
1. The code only considers the case when there is one passenger on the plane (`n == 1`) and returns `1.0` (representing 100% probability). This part is correct.
2. However, for all other cases (when `n > 1`), the code incorrectly returns `1/2` (representing 50% probability). This is not mathematically correct based on the problem's description.

The fix should correctly calculate the probability of the nth person getting their own seat by updating the formula to reflect the correct probability calculation based on the problem constraints.

The fixed code is as follows:
```java
class Solution {
    public double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1.0; // When there is only one passenger, they get their seat
        } else {
            return 0.5; // When there are more than one passengers, the probability of the last person getting their own seat is 50%
        }
    }
}
```
