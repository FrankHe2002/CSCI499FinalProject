The identified bug type is a logical bug in the `maxAbsValExpr` method. The comments in the code suggest that there is confusion about the operations to be performed. A review of the statements reveals that the operations are incorrectly calculated. The implementation can be fixed by refining the calculations based on the defined expression |arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j|.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAbsValExpr(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int n = arr1.length;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int val = Math.abs(arr1[i] - arr1[j]) + Math.abs(arr2[i] - arr2[j]) + Math.abs(i - j);
                max = Math.max(max, val);
            }
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
