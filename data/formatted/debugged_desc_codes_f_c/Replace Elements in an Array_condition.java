The bug type in the provided code is a logical error. It's mistakenly using the greater than operator in the first loop instead of the less than operator, resulting in an infinite loop and a likely `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`. Additionally, the `HashMap` and mapping of array elements with the corresponding indices are unnecessary for the given task.

The fixed code should correct the loop condition, iterate through the `operations` array, and replace the elements of the `nums` array based on the given `operations`. Adding comments to explain the code would also be helpful.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] arrayChange(int[] nums, int[][] operations) {
        for (int[] op : operations) {
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
                if (nums[i] == op[0]) {
                    nums[i] = op[1];
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```
