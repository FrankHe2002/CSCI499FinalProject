Explanation:
The original code has a mistake in the condition `if (m != n)` in the `rotateString` method. This condition incorrectly checks if the lengths of the strings s and goal are not equal, returning false when they're not equal. The correct condition should check if the lengths are equal, returning false when they are not equal.
Additionally, the isMatch method can be simplified.
The fix changes the condition to `if (m == n)`, and the isMatch method to check if the rotated s string matches the goal string directly.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
        int n = s.length();

        if (goal.length() != n) return false;

        for (int offset = 0; offset < n; offset++) {
            if (s.substring(offset) + s.substring(0, offset).equals(goal)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
