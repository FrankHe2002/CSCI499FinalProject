The bug type in the code is an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` and logic error.

The identified bug in the code is out of improper index manipulation which causes an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` and a logic error in the calculation of the array elements.

Firstly, the code `total += nums[i + 2];` attempts to access an index that goes beyond the array bounds. According to the problem description, the code intends to calculate the total sum of the array elements, but the index calculation for `i + 2` is incorrect. 

Secondly, the logic for finding a subsequence whose sum of elements is greater than the sum of non-included elements is flawed. The implementation needs to sort the array in reverse order and obtain the subsequence that satisfies the required conditions.

Additionally, itâ€™s important that because the function should return the answer sorted in non-increasing order, the result must be reversed before returning it.

This can be fixed by changing it to `total += nums[i];`. Along with changing the logic for finding the subsequence.

The fixed code for the Solution class is:
```java
// Runtime: 7 ms (Top 34.08%) | Memory: 44.9 MB (Top 74.04%)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> minSubsequence(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            total += nums[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int sum = 0;
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans.add(nums[i]);
            sum += nums[i];
            if (sum > total - sum) {
                return ans;
            }
        }
        Collections.reverse(ans);
        return ans;
    }
}
```
