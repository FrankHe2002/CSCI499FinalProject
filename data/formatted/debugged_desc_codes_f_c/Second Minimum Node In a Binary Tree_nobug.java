The bug present in the fifth example is related to logical error.

Explanation:
The method `go(TreeNode root)` in the `TreeNode` class has an incorrect approach to finding the second minimum value. The method is flawed as it only compares and updates the second minimum value when the value is not equal to the root value. This results in the incorrect second minimum value when the tree has specific arrangements of repeated values.

Fix:
Change the approach to finding the second minimum value by traversing the entire tree, comparing each node's value with the root value. By updating the condition for the function `go(TreeNode root)`, we can correct this behavior.

// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.8 MB (Top 20.63%)
class Solution {
    int minVal;
    int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    public int findSecondMinimumValue(TreeNode root) {
        minVal = root.val;
        go(root);
        return result == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : result;
    }

    private void go(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        if (root.val > minVal && root.val < result) {
            result = root.val;
        }
        go(root.left);
        go(root.right);
    }
}
```
