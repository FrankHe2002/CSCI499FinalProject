The bug in the provided Java code is within the sort comparison function for ordering the teams. The condition `(l1[i] <= l2[i])` in the comparison logic will always return true due to the `,` operator present before the number `1`. As a result, it will affect the ordering of the characters.

The correct condition here should check for a lesser-than condition only. Additionally, the sorting conditions need to be combined with subsequent checks if the position-wise vote counts are equal.

To fix the issue, the incorrect condition `(l1[i] <= l2[i])` will be replaced with `(l1[i] < l2[i])`. Additionally, the comparison conditions need to be corrected to address equality cases properly.

The fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public String rankTeams(String[] votes) {
        int n = votes.length;
        int teams = votes[0].length();
        Map<Character, int[]> map = new HashMap<>();
        List<Character> chars = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < teams; i++) {
            char team = votes[0].charAt(i);
            map.put(team, new int[teams]);
            chars.add(team);
        }
        
        Arrays.fill(map.get(votes[0].charAt(0)), 0);

        for (String round : votes) {
            for (int j = 0; j < round.length(); j++) {
                map.get(round.charAt(j))[j] -= 1;
            }
        }
        
        chars.sort((a, b) -> {
            int[] l1 = map.get(a);
            int[] l2 = map.get(b);
            for (int i = 0; i < l1.length; i++) {
                if (l1[i] != l2[i]) {
                    return l2[i] - l1[i];
                }
            }
            return a - b;
        });

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : chars) {
            sb.append(c);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
