The bug type in the provided code is a logical error.

The reason for identifying this bug is that the insertion sort algorithm requires properly updating the pointers of the nodes while sorting the linked list, which the original implementation doesn't do correctly.

To fix the bug, the pointers of the linked nodes must be updated accordingly as the nodes are being sorted.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode insertionSortList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode prev = dummy;
        ListNode current = head;
        
        while (current != null) {
            ListNode next = current.next;
            prev = dummy;
            while (prev.next != null && prev.next.val < current.val)
                prev = prev.next;
            current.next = prev.next;
            prev.next = current;
            current = next;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
