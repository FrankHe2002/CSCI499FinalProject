Explanation:
The `reverseString` method has a logical mismatch and a potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. 
1. The update of `temp` in `char temp = s[end + 2];` attempts to access an index beyond the array bounds. 
2. The swapping of elements between `s[end]` and `s[start]` is incorrectly performed. 
3. Additionally, the final swap operation after the while loop swaps the already swapped elements back, the end position with `start`. 
The fix involves updating the temporary variable `temp` and swapping the correct elements by utilizing a temporary variable.

```java

class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int start = 0, end = s.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            char temp = s[start];
            s[start] = s[end];
            s[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }

    }
}
