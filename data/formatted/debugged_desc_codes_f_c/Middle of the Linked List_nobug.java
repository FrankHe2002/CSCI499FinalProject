Explanation:
The issue with the `middleNode` method is that it calculates the index of the middle node, but it should return the middle node itself. The purpose is to find the middle node and return it, not to find its index.

The fix involves using the "Runner" technique to simultaneously traverse the list with two pointers, such that one moves twice as fast as the other. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the midpoint.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
}
```
