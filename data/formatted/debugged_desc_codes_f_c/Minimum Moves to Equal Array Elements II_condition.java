Code Description:
The `minMoves2` function is meant to calculate the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal. Each move consists of incrementing or decrementing an element by 1. The approach used here is to sort the array, find the median, and calculate the sum of absolute differences between each element and the median.
Constraints:
	- n == nums.length
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
	- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Identified Bug:
The code causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to the loop condition `i <= nums.length`, which attempts to access an index out of the array's bounds. In Java, array indices range from 0 to `length - 1`. Additionally, there is a logical error in calculating the sum of absolute differences, focusing the loop iteration.
The fixed approach to calculate the sum of absolute differences is to iterate through the array starting from index 0 and use the absolute difference between the current element and the median as the added sum.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int idx = (nums.length - 1) / 2;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[idx]);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
