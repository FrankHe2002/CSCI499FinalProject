The buggy code tries to find if a given integer `num` is a perfect square using binary search. One issue is that it uses an integer data type for `mid` and `end`, which may overflow for large input values. Also, there is a missing block for the `else if` condition, making the inner conditional blocks confusing and potentially incorrect.

Fixing the `isPerfectSquare` method requires updating the data types for `mid` and `end` to `long` to prevent overflow. Additionally, include braces for the `else if` condition to make the conditions clear.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 40.6 MB (Top 74.32%)

class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long start = 1;
        long end = num;

        while (start <= end) {
            long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (mid * mid == num) {
                return true;
            } else if (mid * mid < num) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
