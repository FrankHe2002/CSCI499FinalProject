The bug in the provided Java code for the countPrefixes function can be identified as incorrect substring comparison logic. The function does not handle the edge cases appropriately and may not accurately identify substrings present at the beginning of the input string.

The fix involves using the startsWith method to directly check if the words in the array are prefixes of the input string s.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countPrefixes(String[] words, String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (s.startsWith(word)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
