The bug in the code is that the condition for finding the repeated sum of the digits is incorrect. The code does not accurately solve the problem as described.

The approach for solving this problem is to find the digital root of a number, where the digital root of a number is the result of summing the individual digits of the number until a single digit is obtained.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        return 1 + (num - 1) % 9;
    }
}
```
