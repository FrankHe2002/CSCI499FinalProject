The issue with the given code is that, in the first for loop, the increment operation for bitCount is incorrect as it refers to a non-existent array variable, "Top++". Additionally, the implementation of the bit manipulation algorithm is conceptually correct but hard to follow due to poor variable naming and lack of comments, making it difficult to understand. 

Therefore, the code could be modified to improve readability and fix the bug.

The corrected code is:

```java
// Runtime: 12 ms (Top 11.96%) | Memory: 44.6 MB (Top 34.33%)
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {

        int[] bitCount = new int[32]; // 32 bit number

        // Count occurrence of each bits in each num
        for (int i = 0; i < bitCount.length; i++) {
            for (int num : nums) {
                if ((num & (1 << i)) != 0) // If ith bit in "num" is 1
                    bitCount[i]++;
            }
        }

        // Check the bit which doesn't have count multiple of 3 (i.e. no of repeating digits in input nums arr)
        // and add it to the result.
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < bitCount.length; i++)
            result |= ((bitCount[i] % 3) << i);

        return result;
    }
}
```
In the fixed code:
1. Fixed the increment operation of bitCount in the first for loop by changing "bitCount[Top]++" to "bitCount[i]++".
2. Updated the bit manipulation logic for accumulating the result to use the bitwise OR operator "|=" to set the appropriate bits in the result variable.
