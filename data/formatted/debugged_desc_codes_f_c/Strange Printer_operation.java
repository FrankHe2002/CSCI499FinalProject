The code provided implements a solution to a dynamic programming problem to calculate the minimum number of turns a strange printer needs to print a given string. This implementation is correct and does not contain any syntax errors. Therefore, there are no bugs to fix.

The code as a whole is free of syntax errors, and it is correctly implementing the logic required for the "Strange Printer" problem.

The implementation showcases the use of dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently. 

Given that the problem is complex and is effectively implemented without any syntax errors, there are no bug fixes to apply to the provided code.

Final fixed code:
```java
class Solution {

    public int strangePrinter(String s) {
        if (s.equals("")) return 0;
        int len = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[len][len];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        for (int l = 2; l <= len; l++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < len && l + i - 1 < len; i++) {
                int j = l + i - 1;
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) ? 0 : 1);
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                    if (s.charAt(k) == s.charAt(j)) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k - 1] + dp[k][j + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][len - 1];
    }
}
