The bug type for the provided Java code is a logical error. The `canBeTypedWords` function does not correctly determine the number of words that can be fully typed using a keyboard with some broken letter keys.

The reasoning process begins by analyzing the code and its output. In this case, the code loops through each character in the `text` string, counting the number of words that can be typed. If a space is encountered, the `count` is incremented, and if a character is in `brokenLetters`, it decrements the `count`. 

The fix is as follows:
- Initialize `count` to 0 rather than 1, to properly count the words.
- The check for `brokenLetters.indexOf(c) != - 1` should decrement `count` only when the current word was previously determined to be "good". This involves modifying the condition and adding a check if the current word is "good" before decrementing `count`.
- Return `count` at the end of the function.

The fully fixed code in markdown is as follows:

```java

class Solution {
    public int canBeTypedWords(String text, String brokenLetters) {
        String[] words = text.split(" ");
        int count = 0;
        boolean isGood;
        for (String word : words) {
            isGood = true;
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                if (brokenLetters.indexOf(c) != -1) {
                    isGood = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isGood) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
