Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation:
The original code fails to correctly solve the problem of returning the number of jumbo and small burgers that can be made given the tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices. It is supposed to solve two linear equations to find the number of jumbo and small burgers. The solution calculates the number of remaining cheese slices for small burgers and adds pairs of burgers based on the number of remaining tomato slices. However, the solution ranges are not entirely correct.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> numOfBurgers(int tomatoSlices, int cheeseSlices) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        if ((tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices) % 2 != 0 || tomatoSlices < 2 * cheeseSlices || tomatoSlices > 4 * cheeseSlices) {
            return list;
        }
        int jumbo = (tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices) / 2;
        int small = cheeseSlices - jumbo;
        list.add(jumbo);
        list.add(small);
        return list;
    }
}
```
