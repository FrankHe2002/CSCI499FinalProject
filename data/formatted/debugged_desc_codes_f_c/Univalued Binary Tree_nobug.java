Bug Type: Logical Error

The original code has a logical error in the `isUnivalTree` method and its supporting variables. The boolean `ans` is meant to be set to `false` when the tree is not univalued, and the method should traverse the tree to check if all nodes have the same value as the first node.

The bug can be fixed by properly setting the `ans` flag to `false` when a mismatch is found and properly maintaining the `firstVal` as the original value to compare against. 

```java
class Solution {
    boolean ans = true;
    int firstVal = 0;

    public boolean isUnivalTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return ans;
        firstVal = root.val;
        traversal(root);
        return ans;
    }

    private void traversal(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return;
        if (root.val != firstVal)
            ans = false;
        traversal(root.left);
        traversal(root.right);
    }

}
```
