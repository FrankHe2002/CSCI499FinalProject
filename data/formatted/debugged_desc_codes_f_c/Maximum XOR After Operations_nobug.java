The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The identified bug and reasoning behind the fix for each example are as follows:

1. Example #1:
   Bug: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException due to incorrect loop condition.
   Fix: Loop condition should be "i < nums.length".

2. Example #2:
   Bug: Missing semicolon inside the loop statement.
   Fix: Add a semicolon at the end of "result += c;".

3. Example #3:
   Bug: Incorrect operation inside the method.
   Fix: Replace addition with multiplication in the "multiply" method.

4. Example #4:
   Bug: Incorrect condition for determining if a number is even.
   Fix: Change the condition to "num % 2 == 0".

5. Example #5:
   Bug: Incorrect logic for determining leap years.
   Fix: Adjust the condition to check for leap years accurately.

After identifying and fixing the bugs in the provided code, the final fixed code for the maximumXOR function is:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumXOR(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            res ^= nums[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
