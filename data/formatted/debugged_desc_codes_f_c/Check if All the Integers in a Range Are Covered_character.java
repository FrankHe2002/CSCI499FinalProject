Bug: Syntax error and incorrect logic

Explanation: 
1. The `for` loop does not contain a comma between the two loop conditions, causing a syntax error.
2. The logic used to check if each integer in the range left to right is covered by at least one interval in ranges is incorrect. The `isCovered` method currently does not appropriately handle the situation where an integer in the range is not covered.

Fix:
1. Add a comma between the two loop conditions in the for loop: `for (int i = left; i <= right, i++)`.
2. In the `isCovered` method, the logic for checking coverage of each integer in the range needs to be adjusted to ensure that all integers are covered by at least one interval in ranges.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 85.31%) | Memory: 41.7 MB (Top 83.50%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isCovered(int[][] ranges, int left, int right) {
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            boolean flag = false;
            for (int[] arr : ranges) {
                if (i >= arr[0] && i <= arr[1]) {
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!flag) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
