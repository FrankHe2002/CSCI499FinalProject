The bug in the code is the calculation of the number of valid substrings. The current logic does not correctly count the number of valid substrings as described in the problem statement, and only counts the number of times the `curRunLength` is less than or equal to the `prevRunLength`, which is incorrect.

The fix is to keep a track of both previous and current run lengths and correctly calculate the number of substrings according to the problem constraints.

The correct logic is to find the minimum of the previous run length and the current run length, and add that to the final count for each iteration.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 47.54%) | Memory: 49 MB (Top 60.10/)
class Solution {
    public int countBinarySubstrings(String s) {
        int i, prevRunLength = 0, curRunLength = 1, count = 0;
        for (i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                curRunLength++;
            } else {
                prevRunLength = curRunLength;
                curRunLength = 1;
            }
            if (prevRunLength >= curRunLength) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
