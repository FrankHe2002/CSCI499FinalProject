The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The original code incorrectly calculates the minimum number of deletion indices needed to make the array of strings lexicographically ordered.

The reasoning for identifying and fixing the bug involves understanding the given problem and ensuring that the code addresses the problem correctly. The code should go through each column and check if the strings in the column are in lexicographical order. If not, it should increment the counter for the minimum number of deletion indices.

The fix involves correcting the column-wise comparison of strings to identify out-of-order characters and properly incrementing the deletion count. 

The fixed code in markdown format is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < strs[0].length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < strs.length - 1; j++) {
                if (strs[j].charAt(i) > strs[j + 1].charAt(i)) {
                    res++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
