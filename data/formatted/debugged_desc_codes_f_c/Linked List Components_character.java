The bug in the provided Java code is that the while loop condition `while head != null` is written without parentheses, as a result of which it is throwing a compilation error. Additionally, inside the while loop, the statement `head = head.next;` is not in a code block, and adding to this issue is that the if block is also not enclosed in braces, which will be a logical error as it is not working as intended.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numComponents(ListNode head, int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            set.add(nums[i]);
        }
        while (head != null) {
            if (set.contains(head.val)) {
                while (head.next != null && set.contains(head.next.val)) {
                    head = head.next;
                }
                count++;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
