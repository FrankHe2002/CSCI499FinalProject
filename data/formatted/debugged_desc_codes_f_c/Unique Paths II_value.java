The bug type in the provided code is a logical error due to an incorrect loop condition and incorrect index access. The code also lacks proper handling when there is an obstacle at the current block.

The fix involves correcting the loop condition and adjusting the index access to correctly check and fill in the path array. The obstacle check should be done with `obstacleGrid[i][j]` instead of `obstacleGrid[i][j]`. Additionally, the position indices should be decremented and the initial obstacle blocking should be handled as well.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length, n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        int[][] path = new int[m][n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) {
                    path[i][j] = 0;
                } else if (i == 0 && j == 0) {
                    path[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    if (i > 0)
                        path[i][j] += path[i - 1][j];
                    if (j > 0)
                        path[i][j] += path[i][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return path[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
```
