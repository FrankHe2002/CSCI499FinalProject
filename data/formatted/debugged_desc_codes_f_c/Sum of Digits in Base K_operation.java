The bug identified in the code is that when calculating the sum of the digits of `n` after converting it from base 10 to base `k`, the code fails to correctly interpret each digit as a base 10 number.

The fix for this bug requires a modification at the point where the sum of the digits of `n` in base `k` is calculated.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            res += n % k;
            n /= k;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
