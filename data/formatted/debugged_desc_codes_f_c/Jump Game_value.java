The bug in the provided code is that the condition inside the for loop is only checking if `maxjump` is less than `i` and returning false if true. It should also check if `maxjump` is less than or equal to `i` because the current value of `maxjump` should also be considered valid. After that, we also need to include a check to return false if `maxjump` equals 0, indicating that it's not possible to make any further jumps forward and reach the last index.

Additionally, the comment `//nums[i]+1 gives themax jump index possible from i` should be moved to a new line for clarity.

Here is the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 67.1%) | Memory: 67.1 MB (Top 78.50%)
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int maxjump = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // If the current index 'i' is more than the current maximum jump 'curr', it means there is no way to jump to the current index...
            // so we should return false
            if (maxjump < i)
                return false;
            else
                maxjump = Math.max(maxjump, nums[i] + i); // Update the current maximum jump...
            if (maxjump == 0 && i < nums.length - 1) // Return false if maxjump becomes 0, indicating unable to make further jumps to reach the last index
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
