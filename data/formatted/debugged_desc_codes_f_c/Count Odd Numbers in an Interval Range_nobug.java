The given code has a bug where the calculation to return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive) is incorrect. If both low and high are even, then the current code divides the difference by 2. But this is incorrect, as the number of odd numbers between two even numbers is half the difference plus 1. The fix involves updating the code to handle the condition where both low and high are even.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        if (low % 2 == 0 && high % 2 == 0) {
            return (high - low) / 2;
        }
        return (high - low) / 2 + 1;
    }
}
```
