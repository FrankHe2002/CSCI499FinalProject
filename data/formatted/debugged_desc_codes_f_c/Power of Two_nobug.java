Explanation:
The method `power2` contains a logical error in the recursive approach to find if a number is a power of 2. The fixed method will use a division-based approach to verify if a number is a power of 2.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        while (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
}
```
