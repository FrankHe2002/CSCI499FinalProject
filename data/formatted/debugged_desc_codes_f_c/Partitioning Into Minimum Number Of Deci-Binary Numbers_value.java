The bug type in the given code is a logical error.

The problem with the code is that the condition `n.charAt(i) - '0'` only considers the maximum digit in the input number. This approach does not ensure that the sum of deci-binary numbers will represent the input integer `n`. The correct approach is to convert each digit independently to a deci-binary number.

The fix is to modify the method to process each digit in the input and select the maximum digit to form the number of deci-binary numbers required. After the fix, the method should consider each digit as a separate entity and independently convert them to a deci-binary number.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 17 ms (Top 24.85%) | Memory: 108.4 MB (Top 36.19%)
class Solution {
    public int minPartitions(String n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n.length(); i++) {
            int digit = n.charAt(i) - '0';
            res = Math.max(res, digit);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
