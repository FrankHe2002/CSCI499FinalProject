Explanation:
The provided code is attempting to find the maximum product of the elements in the given array after at most k operations. The code contains several issues, but the main problems are:
1. The PriorityQueue is initialized without a custom comparator to order elements in descending order.
2. The long variable is not correctly initialized and updated.
3. There is a syntax error in the while loop that checks if the PriorityQueue is not empty.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Queue;

class Solution {
    public int maximumProduct(int[] nums, int k) {

        Queue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b, a));
        for (int num : nums) pq.add(num);

        while (k-- > 0) {
            int top = pq.poll() + 1;
            pq.add(top);
        }

        long res = 1;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            res = (res * pq.poll()) % 1000000007;
        }

        return (int) (res);
    }
}
```
