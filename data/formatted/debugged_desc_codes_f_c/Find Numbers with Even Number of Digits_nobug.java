Explanation:
The `findNumbers` method has a logical error in the condition to check for an even number of digits. The provided conditions are overcomplicated and don't cover all cases. The fix involves changing the approach to count the digits in each integer and then checking if the count is even.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            int digitCount = (int) (Math.log10(val) + 1);
            if (digitCount % 2 == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
