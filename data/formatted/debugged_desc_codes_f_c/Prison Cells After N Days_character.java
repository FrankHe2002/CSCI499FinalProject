The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The `prisonAfterNDays` method has a logical error in calculating whether the number of days is smaller or bigger than 14, as well as an incorrect iteration process based on that determination. The fix involves simplifying the calculation for the number of days and adjusting the iteration process to correctly reflect the number of days.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int n) {
        n = n % 14 == 0 ? 14 : n % 14;
        int temp[] = new int[cells.length];

        while (n-- > 0) {
            for (int i = 1; i < cells.length - 1; i++) {
                temp[i] = cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1] ? 1 : 0;
            }
            cells = temp.clone();
        }

        return cells;
    }
}
```
