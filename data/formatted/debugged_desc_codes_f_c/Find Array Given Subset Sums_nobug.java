The bug in the provided Java code is in the loop condition and statement assignments. The loop condition is incorrect as it checks `i < n`, where `n` is the length of the unknown array. It should check `i < m` to iterate through all the subset sums. Additionally, the code incorrectly assigns the difference value to `diff`. The code should update `sums` to either `left` or `right` based on whether it has 0 or not.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 73 ms (Top 62.96%) | Memory: 85.2 MB (Top 70.37%)
class Solution {
    public int[] recoverArray(int n, int[] sums) {
        Arrays.sort(sums);
        int m = sums.length;
        int[] res = new int[n], left = new int[m / 2], right = new int[m / 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int hasZero = 0, p = -1, q = -1, k = 0;
            int diff = sums[1] - sums[0];
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                if (k <= q && right[k] == sums[j]) {
                    k++;
                } else {
                    if (sums[j] == 0) {
                        hasZero = 1;
                    }
                    left[++p] = sums[j];
                    right[++q] = sums[j] + diff;
                }
            }
            if (hasZero == 1) {
                res[i] = diff;
                sums = left;
            } else {
                res[i] = -diff;
                sums = right;
            }
            m /= 2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
