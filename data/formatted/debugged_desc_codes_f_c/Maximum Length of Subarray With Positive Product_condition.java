The bug in the provided Java code is related to the logic of calculating the maximum length of a subarray with a positive product. The algorithm implementation does not correctly handle the different cases of subarrays and does not consider zero values properly.

The fix requires changing the logic of the method `getMaxLen` to handle subarrays with a positive product correctly and track the length of such subarrays based on the position of zero and the count of negative numbers.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 7 ms (Top 27.34%) | Memory: 84.2 MB (Top 12.92%)
class Solution {
    public int getMaxLen(int[] nums) {
        int first_negative = -1;
        int zero_position = -1;
        int count_neg = 0;
        int res = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < 0) {
                count_neg++;
                if (first_negative == -1) {
                    first_negative = i;
                }
            } else if (nums[i] == 0) {
                count_neg = 0;
                zero_position = i;
                first_negative = -1;
            }
            
            if (count_neg % 2 == 0) {
                res = Math.max(i - zero_position, res);
            } else {
                res = Math.max(i - first_negative, res);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the condition in the loop checks for negative, positive, and zero elements separately and updates the variables `first_negative`, `zero_position`, `count_neg`, and `res` accordingly. The corrected approach covers all scenarios and correctly calculates the maximum length of a subarray with a positive product based on the given constraints.
