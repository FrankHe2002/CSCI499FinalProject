The bug type in this code is a logical error, resulting in an incorrect output due to a flawed approach to identifying special equivalent strings.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug begins with understanding that the current solution is overly complex. A simpler approach can be taken to solve this problem. Additionally, the main error is in the logic for identifying the special-equivalent groups.

The fix will involve implementing an alternative solution and approach to correctly identify the special-equivalent groups of strings.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSpecialEquivGroups(String[] words) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();

        for (String word : words) {
            int[] odd = new int[26];
            int[] even = new int[26];

            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
                int index = word.charAt(i) - 'a';
                if (i % 2 == 0) {
                    even[index]++;
                } else {
                    odd[index]++;
                }
            }

            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for (int num : even) {
                sb.append(num);
            }
            for (int num : odd) {
                sb.append(num);
            }

            set.add(sb.toString());
        }

        return set.size();
    }
}
```
This fixed code uses a HashSet to store unique representations of special-equivalent strings. It loops through each word, creates two array counters for even and odd indices, and then converts and appends both arrays as a unique string representation to the set. Finally, it returns the size of the set to get the number of special-equivalent groups.
