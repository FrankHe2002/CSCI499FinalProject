The bug in the provided code is a logical error in the if-else condition where the x and y coordinates are updated. The initial implementation had the update for 'N' and 'S' reversed, as well as the update for 'E' and 'W'. Since the 'S' update is the opposite of the 'N' update and the 'W' update is the opposite of the 'E' update, these two statements need to be swapped.

Additionally, the check for path crossing is erroneous. Since it is necessary to check if a position has been visited previously, we need to check if the current position already exists in the Set of visited positions after every move.

Lastly, the approach of having x and y coordinates as string concatenated with a comma is not an error but can be simplified using a Pair class from Java's utility library.

Fix:

```java
// Path crossing
// Leetcode
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public boolean isPathCrossing(String path) {
        Set<Pair<Integer, Integer>> visited = new HashSet<>();
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        visited.add(new Pair(x, y));
        for (char c : path.toCharArray()) {
            if (visited.contains(new Pair(x, y))) return true;
            if (c == 'N') y++;
            else if (c == 'S') y--;
            else if (c == 'E') x++;
            else x--;
            visited.add(new Pair(x, y));
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
The fixed code now correctly checks for path crossing and updates the x and y coordinates based on the direction in the given path. It uses a Pair class to store the coordinates instead of concatenating them into a string.
