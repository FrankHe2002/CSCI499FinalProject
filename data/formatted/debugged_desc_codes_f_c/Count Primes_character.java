Explanation:
The error in this code is two-fold. Firstly, there is a missing semicolon at the end of the for loop definition. Secondly, the inner loop should start at `2 * i` instead of `i`.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countPrimes(int n) {
        boolean check[] = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (check[i] == false) {
                count++;
                for (int j = 2 * i; j < n; j += i) {
                    check[j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
