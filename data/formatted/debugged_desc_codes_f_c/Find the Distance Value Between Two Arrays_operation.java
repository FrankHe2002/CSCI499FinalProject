The bug in the provided Java code is incorrect calculation and handling of the variable `x`, which is intended to keep track of the number of elements in `arr1` that satisfies the distance value condition. The loop over `arr2` should not decrement `x` when the condition is met; instead, it should simply break and move to the next element in `arr1` to check the condition for it. Additionally, the initial value of `val` is excessive and unused. The corrected code includes a modification to avoid unnecessary decrement of `x` and cleanup the unused `val` variable.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 68.55%) | Memory: 44.9 MB (Top 25.67-)
class Solution {
    public int findTheDistanceValue(int[] arr1, int[] arr2, int d) {
        int x = 0;
        for (int i : arr1) {
            boolean satisfiesCondition = true;
            for (int j : arr2) {
                if (Math.abs(i - j) <= d) {
                    satisfiesCondition = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (satisfiesCondition) {
                x++;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```
