The code type is finding the bug in some given Java functions and fixing it.

Reasoning:
The bug in the given `distributeCoins(TreeNode root)` function lies in the helper function. The designed logic doesn't account for the moves needed to balance each node. It just adds the left and right subtree moves without considering the parent node's balance. An enhanced approach is to calculate the total moves needed for the left and right subtree and then subtract the excess coins from the parent node value. If the parent has too many (or too few) coins, calculate and add (or subtract) the moves needed from the subtree moves.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    int count = 0;

    public int helper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        int val = left + right + root.val - 1;
        count += Math.abs(val);
        return val;
    }

    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return count;
    }
}
```
