Bug type: Logical Error in Loop Condition and HashMap Usage

Explanation:
1. Logical Error in Loop Condition:
   The loop condition `i >= s.length()` is incorrect. Since the goal is to iterate over the entire string `s`, the condition should be `i < s.length()` to ensure that the loop runs while the index `i` is less than the length of the string `s`.

2. Logical Error in HashMap Usage:
   The HashMap `mp` is used to maintain the occurrence of characters in the string and determine the partition. There are issues with the logic inside the loop that populates and checks the HashMap for the characters.

Fix:
1. The loop condition should be corrected from `i >= s.length()` to `i < s.length()`.

2. The logic for populating and checking the HashMap should be revamped to achieve the correct functional requirements.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String s) {

        List<Integer> lr = new ArrayList<>();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> rightmostIndex = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            rightmostIndex.put(s.charAt(i), i);
        }

        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            end = Math.max(end, rightmostIndex.get(s.charAt(i)));
            if (i == end) {
                lr.add(end - start + 1);
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }

        return lr;
    }
}
```
In the corrected and fixed code:
- A new HashMap called `rightmostIndex` is introduced to store the rightmost index of each character in the string.
- The initial loop populates this HashMap efficiently.
- A new start and end pointer are utilized to keep track of the partitions.

This update eliminates the logical errors and employs a correct HashMap usage to achieve the intended functionality.
