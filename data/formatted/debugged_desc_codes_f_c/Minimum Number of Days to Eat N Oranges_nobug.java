The provided Java code attempts to solve the "Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges" problem using a dynamic programming approach but contains a logical bug as the implementation may exceed the recursion depth limit due to missing base cases.

The bug type is a logical error, leading to incorrect results when solving the problem recursively. The issue is with the recursive implementation, which has no base case to handle when the "n" value becomes 2 or less.

To fix this, additional base cases need to be added to the recursive `dp()` function to handle when "n" becomes less than 2 (0 or 1) to prevent potential stack overflow and incorrect results.

The corrected code is provided below:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map;

    public int minDays(int n) {
        map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(0, 0);
        map.put(1, 1);
        return dp(n);
    }

    public int dp(int n) {
        if (map.containsKey(n))
            return map.get(n);

        int one = 1 + (n % 2) + dp(n / 2);
        int two = 1 + (n % 3) + dp(n / 3);
        int result = Math.min(one, two);
        map.put(n, result);
        return result;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the recursive `dp()` function includes additional base cases that handle when "n" is 0 or 1, preventing the stack from exceeding the recursion depth limit and leading to a correct output for the problem's solution.
