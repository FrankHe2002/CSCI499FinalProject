The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The given `canBeEqual` function is designed to check if the two arrays can be made equal by reversing sub-arrays of the second array. But the logic used in the code is logically incorrect.

The current implementation is not correct because checking for HashMap size is not the right approach to determine if the arrays can be made equal by reversing sub-arrays.

The fixed code will involve comparing the frequency of elements in both arrays. The elements in the 'target' and 'arr' array should match exactly, meaning the frequency of elements in both arrays should be the same.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean canBeEqual(int[] target, int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm1 = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i : arr) {
            hm1.put(i, hm1.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        }
        for (int i : target) {
            if (hm1.containsKey(i)) {
                hm1.put(i, hm1.get(i) - 1);
                if (hm1.get(i) == 0)
                    hm1.remove(i);
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return hm1.isEmpty();
    }
}
```
