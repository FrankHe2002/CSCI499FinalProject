The bug in the provided Java code is in the "numIdenticalPairs" method, more specifically how the pairs are being counted. It is currently counting all of the pairs where the numbers are identical, but it should only count the ones where i < j.

The fix is to only increment the "counter" when the condition nums[i] == nums[j] is met, and i < j. This ensures that only pairs meeting both criteria are counted.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIdenticalPairs(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
                if (nums[i] == nums[j] && i < j) {
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
```
