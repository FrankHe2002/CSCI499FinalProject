The bug type in the buggy Java code is a logical error, as the code does not accomplish what it is intended to do.

The reasoning process for identifying the bug:
- The expected output for poorPigs function is a unique value: the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous.
- By analyzing the code's purpose, we see that the value `T`, calculated as `(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1`, is not used properly within the loop to deduce the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out the poisonous bucket. 
- Additionally, the while loop conditions do not align with the problem's requirements, leading to an incorrect calculation and return output from the function.

The fix:
- Modify the while loop to achieve the desired behavior of the function by updating the conditions and computation process.
- The adjustment in the while loop utilizes the following formula:
  - Let pigPerRound = T + 1 (considering the round itself and the possibility of using the pigs to the end)
  - Let timeRounds = (buckets - 1) / T, as it gives the corresponding number of time rounds needed to test each pig.
  - The function should then return the minimum number of pigs required to cover all the time rounds.

class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1;
        int pigPerRound = T;
        int timeRounds = 0;
        
        while (pigPerRound < buckets) {
            pigPerRound *= T;
            timeRounds++;
        }
        return timeRounds;
    }
}
