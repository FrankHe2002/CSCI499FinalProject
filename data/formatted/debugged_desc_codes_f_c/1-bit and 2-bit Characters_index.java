The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The code always returns false, resulting in incorrect output.

The error in the provided code is in the loop condition and the calculation of the number of one-bits. The calculation of the number of one-bits does not reflect the condition where the last character must be a one-bit character.

The logic should focus on counting the number of one-bits until a zero is encountered. The code should check whether the number of one-bits is odd or even to determine if the last character must be a one-bit character.

The fix involves modifying the logic to correctly calculate the number of one-bits and checking if it's odd or even to identify the last character as a one-bit character.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int ones = 0;
        // Starting from second last (as the last one is always 0).
        for (int i = bits.length - 2; i >= 0 && bits[i] != 0; i--) {
            ones++;
        }
        return ones % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```
