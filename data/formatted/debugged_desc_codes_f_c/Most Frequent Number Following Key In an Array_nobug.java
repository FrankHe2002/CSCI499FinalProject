The bug in the current code is a logical error. The `mostFrequent` function in the given Solution class is designed to find the target with the maximum count such that `nums[i] == key` and `nums[i + 1] == target`. The function, however, does not consider counting occurrences beyond immediate adjacency to the key in the input array.

The fix is to correct the logic of the `mostFrequent` function to count the number of occurrences of the targets that follow the key in the input array and return the target with the maximum count. Additionally, the loop should iterate until `n - 1` in the array to avoid accessing an index out of bounds.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int mostFrequent(int[] nums, int key) {
        int n = nums.length;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == key) {
                int target = nums[i + 1];
                map.put(target, map.getOrDefault(target, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        int max = 0;
        int re = 0;
        for (int x : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.get(x) > max) {
                re = x;
                max = map.get(x);
            }
        }
        return re;
    }
}
```
