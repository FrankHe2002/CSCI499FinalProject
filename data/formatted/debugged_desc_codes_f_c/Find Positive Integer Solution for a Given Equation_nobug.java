The issue is likely to be semantic in that the logic of the function does not match its fixed name/method signatures within the implementation.

An overview of the provided code reveals a misnamed method in the Solution class. The binarySearch method is used to identify the y value but is not quite in line with its logic. 

To fix:
- First, the binarySearch method must return the 'y' value, not the 'x' value. 
- The findSolution should be used to search for the 'x' value in the given range (1 to 1000) and not inside the binary search. Hence, the indexOfY variable must be set to gain access to the getAnsList function.
- Search for the function should only involve the x axis values but use of binary search to find the 'y' values that satisfy the original condition of f(x, y) = z.
- Once the y value is obtained, the x and the identified y form a solution and should be stored.
- The fixed code may look something like this:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findSolution(CustomFunction customfunction, int z) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int y;
        for (int x = 1; x <= 1000; x++) {
            int left = 1, right = 1000;
            while (left <= right) {
                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                int resValue = customfunction.f(x, mid);
                if (resValue == z) {
                    y = mid;
                    List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
                    temp.add(x);
                    temp.add(y);
                    res.add(temp);
                    break;
                } else if (resValue < z) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
