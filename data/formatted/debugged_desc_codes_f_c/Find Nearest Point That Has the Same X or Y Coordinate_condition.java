The bug in the provided Java code for the nearestValidPoint method is the use of an uninitialized variable, index, to store the index of the point with the smallest Manhattan distance from the current location. 

To fix this bug, we can initialize the index variable to -1. We can also remove the commented out line of code, as initializing index to -1 covers the case for when there are no valid points.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int nearestValidPoint(int x, int y, int[][] points) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, index = -1, i;

        for (i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (x == points[i][0] || y == points[i][1]) {
                int d = Math.abs(x - points[i][0]) + Math.abs(y - points[i][1]);
                if (d <= min) {
                    min = d;
                    index = i;
                }
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}
```
