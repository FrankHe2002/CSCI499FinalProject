Functional Bug:
   - The Skiplist class has a functional bug, where the condition for finding the target number is incorrect. This could lead to incorrect search results when verifying if the number exists in the Skiplist structure.

Error in find method:
   - The find method in the Skiplist class contains a logical bug where it is using an incorrect condition for finding the target key. The while loop should be modified to evaluate if the current entry has a down entry, and if the key is greater than the current entry's right key, instead of checking if the current entry has a right entry. This would ensure that the search can proceed down a level if the key is not present in the current level.

Fix:
   - Update the while loop in the find method to correct the search logic. Below is the fixed code:

```java
    private SkipListEntry find(int key) {
        // We have to always start from head
        SkipListEntry current = this.head;

        while (current != null && current.hasDown()) {
            while (current.hasRight() && key > current.right.key) {
                current = current.right;
            }

            if (current.hasDown()) {
                current = current.down;
            }
        }

        // now we are on the lowest level, find the target key
        while (current.hasRight() && key > current.right.key) {
            current = current.right;
        }
        
        if (key == current.right.key) {
            current = current.right;
        }

        return current;
    }
```
