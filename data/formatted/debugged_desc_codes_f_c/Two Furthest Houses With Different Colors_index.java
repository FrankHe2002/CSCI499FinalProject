The bug type in the provided buggy Java code is logical errors due to incorrect calculations.

The reasoning process for identifying and correcting the bugs in the provided buggy Java code is as follows:

1. In the `maxDistance` method, the logical error is located in the while loop conditions, which are incorrectly checking for the same colors rather than different colors.

2. In the first while loop, the variable `l` should be incremented while the color at index `l` is equal to the color at the end of the array, not the reverse as the original code.

3. In the second while loop, the variable `r` should be decremented while the color at index `r` is equal to the color at the start of the array.

4. The return statement should calculate the maximum distance between houses with different colors. This can be done by taking the maximum value between `r` (the distance from the start of the array to the last house with a different color) and `colors.length - 1 - l` (the distance from the last house with a different color to the end of the array).

Applying these fixes will correct the logical errors in the code. Below is the reformatted fixed code in markdown:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 42.7 MB (Top 13.21%)
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] colors) {
        int l = 0, r = colors.length - 1;
        while (colors[r] == colors[colors.length - 1]) r--;
        while (colors[l] == colors[0]) l++;
        return Math.max(r, colors.length - 1 - l);
    }
}
