The bug in the provided Java code is found in the method `countHousePlacements`. There are several conditional statements that do not account for the changing values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Additionally, there are syntax errors in the return statements that do not match the method signature. 

The correct approach should be to use dynamic programming to build the result incrementally. Based on the problem constraints, the results must be returned as an integer modulo 109 + 7.

Below is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;

    public int countHousePlacements(int n) {
        int a = 4, b = 9;
        if (n == 1) {
            return a;
        }
        if (n == 2) {
            return b;
        }
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            c = (int) ((a + b) % mod);
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }

        return (int) ((1L * c * c) % mod);
    }
}
```
In the provided code, a single loop is used to calculate the number of ways houses can be placed based on previous values, and the modulo operations are performed where necessary.

Please note that the value `1e9 + 7` is used as the modulo value, casting to long integer values, and the final result is cast to an integer for compatibility with the method signature.
