The bug in the provided Java code for `getWinner` method is that due to the condition `count = 2`, the count is getting reset to a fixed value directly when `winner` is updated. This results in incorrect winner calculation when `k` is higher than 2. 

To fix the bug, the code should increment the game count `count` when `winner` does not change and reset `count` to 1 only when `winner` changes. 

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int getWinner(int[] arr, int k) {

        int winner = arr[0];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (winner > arr[i])
                count++;
            else {
                winner = arr[i];
                count = 1;  // Reset count to 1 when winner changes
            }
            if (count == k)
                return winner;
        }
        return winner;
    }
}
```
