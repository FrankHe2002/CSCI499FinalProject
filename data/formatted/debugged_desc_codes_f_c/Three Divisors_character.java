Explanation:
The bugs in the code relate to the logic for checking three positive divisors. The loop stopping condition `i * i < n` should be changed to `i * i <= n`. Additionally, in the loop, the condition to check if `n` is divisible by `i` is incorrect. The condition should check if `n` is divisible by both `i` and `res`, and this should be done for the two factors of `n`. Finally, missing semicolon at the end of the statement `return true`.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isThree(int n) {
        if (n < 4) return false;
        int res = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0 && n / i != i) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
