The bug in the provided Java code is that the condition `if (r + c != mat.length * mat[0].length)` used to check if the reshape operation is possible and legal is incorrect. The reshape operation is possible if the product of the number of rows and the number of columns (r * c) matches the product of the input matrix's number of rows and columns (mat.length * mat[0].length).

The condition needs to be `if (r * c != mat.length * mat[0].length)` instead of `if (r + c != mat.length * mat[0].length)`.

Additionally, the solution code has an unnecessary if condition to check if j reaches c, which should be removed to correctly reshape the matrix.

The fixed code with the identified bug types addressed (Logical Error and Syntax Error) is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] mat, int r, int c) {
        if (r * c != mat.length * mat[0].length) {
            return mat;
        }
        
        int[][] ans = new int[r][c];
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        for (int k = 0; k < mat.length; k++) {
            for (int l = 0; l < mat[0].length; l++) {
                ans[i][j] = mat[k][l];
                j++;
                if (j == c) {
                    i++;
                    j = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
