Code Description:
The `maximumSwap` function is designed to find the maximum valued number that can be obtained by swapping two digits at most once in the given input integer. The function has issues with the while loop, and the search variable is being used before it is declared.

Bug Type:
1. Syntax Error - due to the usage of the `search` variable before its declaration.
2. Logical Error - due to incorrect iteration condition in the first while loop.

Fix:
1. Declare the `search` variable before using it in the initial while loop.
2. Correct the condition in the first while loop to compare against the proper indices and elements in the array.

The fixed Java code:
```java

class Solution {
    public int maximumSwap(int num) {
        char str[] = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();
        char arr[] = str.clone();
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int i = 0;
        int j = str.length - 1;
        int search = j;
        while (i < str.length && j >= 0 && arr[search] == str[i]) {
            i++;
            j--;
            search = j;
        }
        if (i == str.length) return num;
        j = str.length - 1;
        while (arr[search] != str[j]) {
            j--;
        }

        char c = str[i];
        str[i] = str[j];
        str[j] = c;
        return Integer.parseInt(new String(str));
    }
}
```
