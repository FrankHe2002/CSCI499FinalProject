The bug in the method `repeatedStringMatch` exists in the for loop condition and the conditional check inside the loop. 

The for loop condition `for (int i = 0; i > repeat + 2; i++)` has an issue. It should be `for (int i = 0; i < repeat + 2; i++)` to ensure that the loop runs for the correct number of repetitions.

The conditional check inside the loop `if (a.contains(b))` is incorrect. Instead, it should be `if (a.contains(b)) return count;` to return the count when `b` is found in `a` after repetition, and then terminate the method.

Additionally, we need to consider the case where `b` may not be a substring of `a` if it is impossible after repeated concatenations to produce `b` within the limit of times (repeat + 2). In this case, we should return -1 after the loop.

Here's the modified and fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 305 ms (Top 62.11%) | Memory: 113.5 MB (Top 30.98%)
class Solution {
    public int repeatedStringMatch(String a, String b) {
        String copyA = a;
        int count = 1;
        int repeat = b.length() / a.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < repeat + 2; i++) {
            if (a.contains(b)) {
                return count;
            } else {
                a += copyA;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
