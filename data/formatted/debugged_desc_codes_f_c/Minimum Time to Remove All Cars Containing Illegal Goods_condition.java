The bug in the given code involves the calculation of the minimum time required to remove train cars with illegal goods. The third step in the loop to merge the time taken to remove cars from the left and right end is incorrect, as it does not merge optimally. We need to find the minimum time to remove all illegal cars instead of just the cars from the left and right end.

The fix involves changing step 3 to merge the optimized times for each position of the train cars.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 42 ms (Top 58.8%) | Memory: 47.53 MB (Top 50.0%)

class Solution {
    public int minimumTime(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int min = s.length();
        int[] nums = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = s.charAt(i) - '0';

        // step1
        int[] leftOptimized = new int[n + 2];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            leftOptimized[i] = Math.min(i, leftOptimized[i - 1] + (nums[i - 1] != 1 ? 2 : 0));
        }

        // step2
        int[] rightOptimized = new int[n + 2];
        for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
            rightOptimized[i] = Math.min(n - i + 1, rightOptimized[i + 1] + (nums[i - 1] == 1 ? 2 : 0));
        }

        // step3 - merge optimized times for each position
        for (int p = 0; p <= n; p++) {
            min = Math.min(min, leftOptimized[p] + rightOptimized[p]);
        }

        return min;
    }
}
