The provided Java code contains a bug. It is causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to attempting to access an index out of the array's bounds, and logically the `max` and `counter` are being incremented and checked incorrectly.

The bug type is an off-by-one error and logical error.

The fix involves:
1. Changing the loop condition to `i < flips.length - 1` to avoid accessing an index out of the array's bounds.
2. Increment the counter before the comparisons.
3. The comparison of `max` should be done based on `flips[i]` instead of `flips[i + 1]`.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTimesAllBlue(int[] flips) {
        int counter = 0, total = 0, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < flips.length - 1; i++) {
            ++counter;
            max = Math.max(max, flips[i]);
            if (counter == max) total++;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```
