There is no apparent bug in the provided code. It seems to be working correctly to reconstruct and return the queue as represented by the input array 'people'. Additionally, based on the comments, the solution is efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage.

The code uses a lambda expression to sort the 'people' array based on their heights and the number of people in front of them. Then, it utilizes a list to add people to the corresponding position in the queue based on the number of people in front of them.

The logic and sorting methods seem to be correct. Therefore, there is no bug to fix, and the code appears to be functioning as intended.

Final code:
```java
// Runtime: 9 ms (Top 81.09%) | Memory: 53.8 MB (Top 84.02%)
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>(); //return value

        Arrays.sort(people, (a, b) -> {
            int x = Integer.compare(b[0], a[0]);
            if (x == 0) return Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]);
            else return x;
        });

        for (int[] p : people)
            result.add(p[1], p);

        return result.toArray(new int[people.length][2]);
    }
}
```
