Code Description:
The given Java function, named numOfSubarrays, aims to return the number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to the specified threshold from a given array of integers.

Buggy Code:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 95.20%) | Memory: 53.3 MB (Top 91.54%)
class Solution {
    public int numOfSubarrays(int[] arr, int k, int threshold) {
        int average = 0, count = 0, start = 0, sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
            if (i >= k - 1) {
                average = sum / k;
                if (average >= threshold) count++;
                sum -= arr[start];
                start++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

Bug: The bug in the code is that the average calculation is incorrect, which directly affects the comparison with the threshold and subsequently determines the count of valid sub-arrays.

Reasoning:
1. The `average` calculation should sum elements in the sub-array of size k and then divide by k to get the true average.
2. The valid sub-arrays are those where the average is greater than or equal to the threshold.

Fix:
The fix involves correcting the computation of the `average` and its logical comparison to the threshold.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfSubarrays(int[] arr, int k, int threshold) {
        int count = 0, sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        if (sum / k >= threshold) count++;
        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
            if (sum / k >= threshold) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
