The bug in the provided code is that it does not correctly track the kth distinct string. This means that the code does not check all the distinct strings before returning a result. The incorrect output might be returned especially if the string at index k is not a distinct string. 

The fix involves using two separate loops. The first loop is used to create the map of each string in the array and its count, while the second loop is used to find the kth distinct string from the map. 

Also, the code should handle the case where the value of k might be higher than the number of distinct strings in the array.

Here's the fixed code in markdown format:

```java
class Solution {
    public String kthDistinct(String[] arr, int k) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String s : arr) {
            map.put(s, map.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (String s : arr) {
            if (map.get(s) == 1) {
                count++;
                if (count == k) {
                    return s;
                }
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
}
```
