The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The code aims to find the earliest year with the maximum population from a 2D integer array logs that indicates the birth and death years of each person. The bug is the local variable names `maxNum` and `maxYear`, which do not correspond to their purposes, leading to a logical error in how the maximum population and its corresponding year are handled.

The approach for fixing the code is to change the local variable names to correctly represent their purposes and to ensure proper tracking of the maximum population and its earliest year. Additionally, we should consider the constraints and the range of birth and death years in the calculations to avoid any potential index out of bounds issues.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumPopulation(int[][] logs) {

        int[] year = new int[101]; // Initialize an array to store population by year from 1950 to 2050

        for (int[] log : logs) {
            year[log[0] - 1950] += 1;  // Increment population for birth year
            year[log[1] - 1950] -= 1;  // Decrement population for death year
        }

        int maxPopulation = 0, maxYear = 0, population = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < year.length; i++) {
            population += year[i];  // Calculate the running population
            if (population > maxPopulation) {
                maxPopulation = population;  // Update the maximum population
                maxYear = i + 1950;  // Update the year with maximum population
            }
        }

        return maxYear;
    }
}
```
