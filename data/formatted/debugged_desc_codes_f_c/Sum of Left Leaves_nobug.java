The provided Java code contains a logical bug in the method `sumOfLeftLeaves` which attempts to find the sum of all left leaves in a binary tree. The if condition `if (root.left != null && root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null)` is used to check if the current node is a left leaf, but it does not account for all cases. Additionally, the original implementation incorrectly returns the sum of the current node's left child value and the recursive calls for both the left and right subtrees. 

The fix involves checking whether the current node's left child is a leaf node and maintaining a separate leftSum variable to accumulate the sum of the left leaf nodes. The following code includes the necessary modifications to address these issues:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;

        int leftSum = 0;
        if (root.left != null) {
            if (root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null) {
                leftSum = root.left.val;
            } else {
                leftSum = sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left);
            }
        }

        return leftSum + sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right);
    }
}
```

In this fixed code:
- We introduce a new variable `leftSum` to store the sum of the values of left leaf nodes, initialized with 0.
- We check if the root node has a left child. If it does, we then check whether it is a leaf node. If it is, we add the value of the left leaf node to `leftSum`. If not, we make a recursive call to the `sumOfLeftLeaves` method with the left child.
- We return the sum of `leftSum` and the recursive call to `sumOfLeftLeaves` with the right child.

These modifications correct the logical errors in the original code and improve the accuracy and robustness of the left leaf node sum calculation.
