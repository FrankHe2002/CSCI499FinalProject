The identified bug in the provided Java code is that the logic for calculating the minimum difference between the largest and smallest values of the array is incorrect. The code currently sorts the array and then tries to calculate the minimum difference by removing the three smallest or largest values. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases and may not give the correct result.

The fix for this bug is to consider all four possible sets of three values in the array when calculating the minimum difference. This can be achieved by iterating through the array and computing the minimum difference for each set of three values. After computing the differences for all sets, the minimum difference can be returned as the result.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length <= 4) {
            return 0;
        }

        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int n = nums.length;
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Compare the 4 possible combinations of removing 3 elements
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            res = Math.min(res, nums[n - 1 - (3 - i)] - nums[i]);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
