Explanation:
The `detectCapitalUse` method has an incorrect implementation. It does not correctly detect if the usage of capitals in the word is right. Additionally, the implementation of the first case is flawed. The logic to check the first letter with a capital is not correct.

The fix involves checking for each of the given cases individually, returning true immediately if the first case is detected and false if any of the other cases are detected. This can simplify the logic and make the code more readable and maintainable.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean detectCapitalUse(String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if ('A' <= word.charAt(i) && word.charAt(i) <= 'Z') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count == word.length() || count == 0 || (count == 1 && 'A' <= word.charAt(0) && word.charAt(0) <= 'Z')) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
This final implementation handles each case distinctly, providing a more accurate outcome.
