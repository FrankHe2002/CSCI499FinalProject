There are several issues in the provided Java code:

1. Logical issue in the for loop conditional bounds related to k radius
2. Missing semicolon in one line that causes a syntax error

The first issue can be fixed by adjusting the for loop bounds for the range that calculates the k-radius average. The correct range to iterate over is from k to `N - k - 1`.

The second issue is easily fixed by adding a semicolon at the end of the incomplete expression in the range calculation line.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] getAverages(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (k == 0) return nums;

        int N = nums.length;
        long[] sum = new long[N];
        sum[0] = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++)
            sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i]; // Sum of 0 - ith element at sum[i]

        int[] ret = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(ret, -1);

        for (int i = k; i < N - k; i++) { // Corrected bounds for k-radius average range
            long temp = (sum[i + k] - sum[i - k]) / (k * 2 + 1); // Added missing semicolon
            ret[i] = (int) temp;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```
