The bug in the given code is in the initialization of the `frequency` array. The snippet `int[] frequency = new int[1];` initializes a new array with only one element. The length of the array should be `k` as dictated by the problem description. Additionally, there is a missing semicolon in the line `result += c` within the `repeatChar` function from earlier, but that is unrelated to this problem. We need to fix the array initialization and add the missing semicolon.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 78.2%) | Memory: 60.02 MB (Top 5.2%)

class Solution {
    public boolean canArrange(int[] arr, int k) {
        int[] frequency = new int[k];
        for (int num : arr) {
            num %= k;
            if (num < 0) num += k;
            frequency[num]++;
        }
        if (frequency[0] % 2 != 0) return false;

        for (int i = 1; i <= k / 2; i++) {
            if (frequency[i] != frequency[k - i]) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
