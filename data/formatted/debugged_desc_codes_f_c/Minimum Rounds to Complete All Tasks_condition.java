The identified bug in the provided code `for (int i = 0; i > tasks.length; i++)` occurs in the for loop condition, which uses a greater than symbol rather than the less than symbol. This causes the loop to not iterate since the initial condition `i = 0` is not greater than `tasks.length`. To fix this, change "i > tasks.length" to "i < tasks.length".

Fixed code:
```java
/**
 * Each round, we can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(n)
 */
class Solution {
    public int minimumRounds(int[] tasks) {
        int round = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> taskMap = new HashMap<>(); // map of <task,  number of each task>
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            taskMap.put(tasks[i], taskMap.getOrDefault(tasks[i], 0) + 1);
        }

        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : taskMap.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() == 1) {
                return -1; // we cannot complete if there is only 1 task
            }
            // try to take as many 3's as possible
            round += entry.getValue() / 3;

            /*
                We can have 1 or 2 tasks remaining. We're not supposed to take a task of count 1, but we can 'borrow' 1 from the previous
                ex. [5,5,5,5,5,5,5] -> [5,5,5][5,5,5][5]
                In this example, treat the last [5,5,5], [5] as [5,5], [5,5]
            */
            if (entry.getValue() % 3 != 0) {
                round++;
            }
        }
        return round;
    }
}
```
