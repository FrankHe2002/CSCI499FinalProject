The provided code is meant to count the number of homogenous substrings in a given string by iterating through the string and calculating the count of homogenous substrings.

There are a couple of errors in the code:
1. The for loop condition is incorrect and will never run because `i` starts with 1, so `i` will always be greater than `s.length()`. It should be `i < s.length()` instead of `i > s.length()`.
2. Additionally, there are missing curly braces around the for loop body.
3. The condition to check for a homogenous character sequence is incorrect. It currently checks if the current character is equal to the previous character, but it does not account for the fact that a homogenous substring can exist without being adjacent to each other. The count of homogenous substrings should be calculated correctly.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 25 ms (Top 22.57%) | Memory: 50.5 MB (Top 79.00%)
class Solution {
    public int countHomogenous(String s) {
        int res = 0;
        int carry = 1;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) carry++;
            else carry = 1;
            res = (res + carry) % mod;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
