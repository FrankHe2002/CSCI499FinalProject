The identified bug in the code is that the condition within the else if statement does not correctly check for the presence of the mapping (bijections) between a letter in the pattern and a word in s.

The incorrect condition can be found here:
```java
} else if (! (map.containsKey(ch) || map.containsValue(arr[i]))) {
    map.put(ch, arr[i]);
}
```

The correct check should ensure that the bijection between a pattern letter and a string in s is valid. To fix the bug, we should ensure the following:
1. If the map contains the character ch, it should be mapped to the corresponding string arr[i].
2. If the map does not contain the character ch, but the string arr[i] is already associated with another character in the map, then the bijection is not valid.
3. Otherwise, put the character and its corresponding string in the map.

Upon analyzing the condition, a replacement for the else if statement is required.

Additionally, the returned value should be `false` if no valid condition satisfies the bijection.

The code should be fixed in the following way:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean wordPattern(String pattern, String s) {
        String[] arr = s.split(" ");
        if (pattern.length() != arr.length) return false;
        Map<Character, String> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < pattern.length(); i++) {
            char ch = pattern.charAt(i);
            if (map.containsKey(ch)) {
                if (!map.get(ch).equals(arr[i])) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                if (map.containsValue(arr[i])) {
                    return false;
                }
                map.put(ch, arr[i]);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
