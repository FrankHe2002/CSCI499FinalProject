Bug Type:
Logical error
Syntax error

Explanation:
1. The `isLeapYear` method incorrectly includes non-leap years in its condition. The correct leap year condition is a year being divisible by 4 and not by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400. The fix adjusts the condition to `(year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)`, correctly identifying leap years.
2. The `chalkReplacer` method has a logical error in the return statement. It should be simply `return i;` instead of `return + 1;`.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        if ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int chalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) {
            sum += c;
        }
        long left = k % sum;
        for (int i = 0; i < chalk.length; i++) {
            if (left >= chalk[i]) {
                left -= chalk[i];
            } else {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return i; 
    }
}
```
