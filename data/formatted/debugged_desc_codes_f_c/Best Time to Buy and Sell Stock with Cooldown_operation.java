The bug in the code is related to the index initialization and the outer loop condition since they are not written correctly. In the inner for loop, buy should range from 0 to 1 (buy=0 for buying stock and buy=1 for selling stock). Additionally, the outer for loop iteration for the index should be decremented properly.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 55.13%) | Memory: 42.3 MB (Top 47.48%)
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int n = prices.length;

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 2][2];

        for (int index = n - 1; index >= 0; index--) {
            for (int buy = 0; buy <= 1; buy++) {

                int profit = 0;

                if (buy == 0) { // buy stocks
                    profit = Math.max(-prices[index] + dp[index + 1][1], dp[index + 1][0]);
                }
                if (buy == 1) { // we can sell stocks
                    profit = Math.max(prices[index] + dp[index + 2][0], dp[index + 1][1]);
                }
                dp[index][buy] = profit;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
```
