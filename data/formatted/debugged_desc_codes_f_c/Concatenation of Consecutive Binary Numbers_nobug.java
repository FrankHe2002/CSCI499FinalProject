The bug type in the provided Java code for the `concatenatedBinary` function is a logical error.

The logical error in the code is inside the for loop where `res` value is calculated. 

- Using `Math.pow(2, Integer.toBinaryString(i).length())` to calculate the number of bits for each `i` will cause issues for larger values of `i`. A more straightforward method would be to manually keep track of the number of bits.

- By directly appending `i` to `res`, the binary value of the next number is not properly concatenated to the existing `res` value. A shift and addition operation is needed to fully append the binary representation of the number to `res`.

To fix the logical error:
	- Keep track of the number of bits for each `i`.
	- Append the binary representation of `i` to `res` using shift and addition operations.

The final fixed code in markdown:

```java
// Runtime: 613 ms (Top 30.00%) | Memory: 117.4 MB (Top 18.57%)
class Solution {
    public int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
        long res = 0;
        
        int shift = 0;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if ((i & (i - 1)) == 0) {
                shift++;
            }
            res = ((res << shift) + i) % mod;
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
