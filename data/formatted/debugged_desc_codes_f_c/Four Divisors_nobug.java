The bug type in the last example is a logical error. The nested loops are not computing the sum of divisors correctly as it doesn't account for the conditions of having exactly four divisors. The fix would be to correct the nested loops to find the sum of divisors and counter for the divisors, and then check if the count is exactly 4.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumFourDivisors(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i * i <= val; i++) {
                if (val % i == 0) {
                    sum += i;
                    count++;
                    if (i != val / i) {
                        sum += val / i;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                if (count > 4) {
                    break;  // Terminate loop early as it will exceed 4 divisors
                }
            }
            if (count == 4) {
                res += sum;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
