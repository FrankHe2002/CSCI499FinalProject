Explanation:
The error here involves the condition within the for loop, which prevents the process from checking all adjacent pairs of numbers in `nums`. The new index calculation, `int newIndex = i - deletion`, results in increasing the current index after an element is deleted. The condition, `(newIndex * 2 == 0)`, aims to check an even index after deletion, but it's incorrectly written. In addition, the condition should also be checking for inequality between adjacent elements at even indices.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 8 ms (Top 50.94%) | Memory: 58.2 MB (Top 89.06%)
class Solution {
    public int minDeletion(int[] nums) {

        int deletion = 0, n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ) {
            int newIndex = i - deletion;
            if (newIndex % 2 == 0 && nums[newIndex] == nums[newIndex + 1]) deletion++;
            else i++;
        }
        return ((n - deletion) % 2 == 0) ? deletion : deletion + 1;
    }
}
```
