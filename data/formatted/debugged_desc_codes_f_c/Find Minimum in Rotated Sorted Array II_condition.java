The provided buggy Java code contains a logical error in the while loop condition of the `findMin` method, which is evident from the incorrect termination condition and the absence of cases for when elements are not equal. The code relies on the sortedness property, but it has time complexity O(n) due to extra iterations and does not consider special edge cases.

Here's the fixed code (with minimal changes) in markdown format:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] > nums[end]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] < nums[end]) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                end--;
            }
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
}
```

I've refactored the code to include a single while loop with appropriate conditions to check for relevant inequalities, handling the case when there are repeated elements and edge cases at start and end of the array. I've modified the variable names to improve readability and understandability. With these changes, the code becomes efficient, handling edge cases and not relying on unnecessary iterations, reducing the overall operation steps and effectively and efficiently determining the minimum element of the array.
