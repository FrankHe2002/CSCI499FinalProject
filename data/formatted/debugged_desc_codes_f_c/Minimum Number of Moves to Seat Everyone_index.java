Bug type: Logical error.

The bug is in the `minMovesToSeat` method. It has the following issues:
1. The array length is accessed outside its bounds: The loop `for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++)` iterates over the seats array, and inside it, `students[i + 1]` is accessed without proper bounds checking. This will result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
2. Incorrect calculation of the difference: The `diff` variable is meant to store the minimum moves, but the calculation `diff += Math.abs(students[i + 1] - seats[i]);` doesn't represent this logically. It should compare the distances between the seats and the students to find the minimum total move.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 99.78%) | Memory: 41.7 MB (Top 99.11%)
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        Arrays.sort(seats);
        Arrays.sort(students);
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
            diff += Math.abs(students[i] - seats[i]);
        }
        return diff;
    }
}
```
