The bug in the provided Java code is that there are missing semicolons at the end of the statement inside the `dfs` method. The syntax error needs to be fixed by adding semicolons at the end of the following lines:
1. `dfs(rods, left, right, level + 1, n, result);`
2. `dfs(rods, left + rods[level], right, level + 1, n, result);`
3. `dfs(rods, left, right + rods[level], level + 1, n, result);`

Additionally, a validation for the edge case when no rods are given is needed. Otherwise, the result would remain 0, which would be misleading as 0 could be an actual possible outcome in this problem's context. Hence we set the result to Integer.MIN_VALUE initially and return 0 only if the result is Integer.MIN_VALUE.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int tallestBillboard(int[] rods) {
        int[] result = new int[] {Integer.MIN_VALUE};
        dfs(rods, 0, 0, 0, rods.length, result);
        return result[0] == Integer.MIN_VALUE ? 0 : result[0];
    }

    private void dfs(int[] rods, int left, int right, int level, int n, int[] result) {
        if (level == n) {
            if (left == right) {
                result[0] = Math.max(left, result[0]);
            }
            return;
        }

        dfs(rods, left, right, level + 1, n, result);
        dfs(rods, left + rods[level], right, level + 1, n, result);
        dfs(rods, left, right + rods[level], level + 1, n, result);
    }
}
```
