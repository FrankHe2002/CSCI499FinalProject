The bug type is a logical error.

Reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The algorithm provided in the code does not make logical sense and does not correspond to the problem description or constraints.
2. The approach in the current code is not clearly covering the situation of constructing palindromic strings as described in the problem statement.
3. The code seems to be incorrectly computing the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String word1, String word2) {
        int n = word1.length(), m = word2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n + m][n + m];
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                dp[i][j] = word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(j) ? dp[i + 1][j + 1] + 1 : Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
            }
        }
        int mx = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
                if ((i == 0 || j == 0) && dp[i][j] > mx)
                    mx = dp[i][j];
            }
        }
        return mx;
    }
}
```
