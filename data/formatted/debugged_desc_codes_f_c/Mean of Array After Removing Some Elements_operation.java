Explanation:
The original code has several issues:
1. The process of removing the smallest and largest 5% of the elements is incorrect.
2. There are missing semicolons at the end of the two for-loops.
3. The multiplication inside the first for-loop should be an addition (to calculate the sum).

To fix these issues:
1. We need to calculate the proper range of elements to be removed based on the 5% requirement and eliminate those elements.
2. Add semicolons at the end of the two for-loops.
3. Change the multiplication in the first for-loop to addition to calculate the sum correctly.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public double trimMean(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int length = arr.length;
        int toRemove = length * 5 / 100;
        int total = 0;
        for (int number : arr) {
            total += number;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < toRemove; i++) {
            total -= arr[i];
        }
        for (int i = length - 1; i >= length - toRemove; i--) {
            total -= arr[i];
        }
        length -= (2 * toRemove);
        return (double) ((double) total / (double) length);
    }
}
```
