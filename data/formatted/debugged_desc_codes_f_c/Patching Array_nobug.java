The bug in the code is logic-related. The goal of the code is to find the minimum number of patches required to add elements to the array such that any number in the range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. The current logic is incorrect and doesn't fulfill this requirement.

Additionally, the code uses `long` as the data type for the variable `sum`, but the return type of the function is `int`. As a result, the data type of `sum` should be compatible with the return type.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        long sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (sum < n) {
            if (i < nums.length && nums[i] <= sum + 1) {
                sum += nums[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                sum += sum + 1;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
