Code Description:
The given code is for finding the minimum initial amount of energy required to finish all the tasks in an array. The tasks are stored as pairs of actual and minimum energy. The code iterates through the sorted tasks and calculates the minimum initial energy required based on the task-specific energy requirements and the current running sum.

Bug Type:
The given buggy Java code has a bug related to an off-by-one error in the for loop condition, which leads to an out-of-bounds access, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix:
The fix is to change the loop condition from `i <= tasks.length` to `i < tasks.length` to ensure that the last valid index is `tasks.length - 1`.

The final fixed code in markdown format:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minimumEffort(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                return (b[1] - b[0]) - (a[1] - a[0]);
            }
        });
        int sum = 0, max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, sum + tasks[i][1]);
            sum += tasks[i][0];
        }

        return max;

    }
}
```
