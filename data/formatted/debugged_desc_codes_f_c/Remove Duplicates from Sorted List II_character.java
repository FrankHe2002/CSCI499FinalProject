The bug in the code is the incorrect logic used to delete nodes with duplicate values from the list. The given code attempts to maintain an array of counters of the occurrence of each value in the list. Then, it tries to update the linked list based on the array's count, but the logic doesn't effectively delete the duplicate nodes and keep the single occurrence nodes.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly update and maintain the linked list by removing the nodes with duplicate values.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 8.62% | Memory: 43.1 MB (Top 83.93%)
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;

        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode current = head;
        ListNode previous = dummy;

        while (current != null) {
            while (current.next != null && current.val == current.next.val) {
                current = current.next;
            }

            if (previous.next != current) {
                previous.next = current.next;
            } else {
                previous = previous.next;
            }

            current = current.next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we traverse the list and compare values. If duplicate values are found, we update the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip the duplicate node. If no duplicates are found, we update the `previous` pointer to the current node and continue. This correctly removes the duplicate nodes from the linked list.
