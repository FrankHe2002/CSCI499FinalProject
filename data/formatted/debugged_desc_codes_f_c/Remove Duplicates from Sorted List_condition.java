The bug in the provided Java code is that the logic to delete duplicates in a sorted linked list is incorrect. It only checks for duplicate neighbors rather than removing all duplicate values.

The correct approach is to compare each node with its next to check for and remove duplicates.

The fixed code is:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.5 MB (Top 99.82%)
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {

        ListNode current = head;

        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            if (current.val == current.next.val) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            } else {
                current = current.next;
            }
        }

        return head;
    }
}
```
