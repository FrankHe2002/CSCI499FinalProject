The bug type for this code is a logical error. The `invertTree` method contains a logical error: it should return a new root after inverting the tree, but instead, it returns the original root without modifications. The essence of the problem is that the method is making the changes in place, and when the root is returned, it is the original root rather than the inverted one. Therefore, to fix this issue, it is essential to ensure that the `invertTree` method returns the new root after inverting the tree.

Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }

        TreeNode left = invertTree(root.left);
        TreeNode right = invertTree(root.right);

        root.left = right;
        root.right = left;

        return root;
    }
}
```
