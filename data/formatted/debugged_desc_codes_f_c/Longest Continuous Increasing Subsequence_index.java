The identified bug in the provided Java code is in the `findLengthOfLCIS` method of the Solution class. The bug is a logical error in the if condition `if (nums[2] > nums[i - 1])` which should be checking `if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1])`. This has led to incorrect identification of the increasing subsequence. Additionally, `maxCount = Math.max(count, maxCount);` should be placed outside the for loop to handle the scenario where the longest increasing subsequence extends to the end of the input array.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 45.4 MB (Top 76.62%)
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int count = 1;
        int maxCount = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                count++;
            } else {
                maxCount = Math.max(count, maxCount);
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        maxCount = Math.max(count, maxCount);
        return maxCount;
    }
}
```
