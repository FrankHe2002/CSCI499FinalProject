The bug in the provided code is that the variable `b` in the condition `if (visited[b] == true)` is undefined, causing a compilation error.

The cause of the bug is that the code tries to reference the variable `b`, which is not declared or initialized. It is likely a typographical error, and the intended variable name is `i`, which represents the iteration variable in the loop.

To fix the code, the variable name `b` should be replaced with `i` in the provided line of code. Additionally, the variable `v` should be checked that it is within the bounds of `visited` before accessing it.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 95 ms (Top 56.92%) | Memory: 193.9 MB (Top 33.32%)
class Solution {
    public long countPairs(int n, int[][] edges) {
        //Building Graph
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        for (int arr[] : edges) {
            graph.get(arr[0]).add(arr[1]);
            graph.get(arr[1]).add(arr[0]);
        }
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[n];
        long res = 0;
        int prev = 0;
        int count[] = { 0 };
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++) { // Running for loop on all connected components of graph
            if (i >= visited.length || visited[i] == true) continue; // if the node is already reached by any other vertex then we don't need to traverse it again
            dfs(graph, i, visited, count);
            long a = n - count[0]; // (total - current count)
            long b = count[0] - prev; // (current count - prev )
            prev = count[0]; // Now Store count to prev
            res += (a * b);
        }
        return res;
    }

    void dfs(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph, int v, boolean vis[], int count[]) {
        vis[v] = true;
        count[0]++; //for counting connected nodes
        for (int child : graph.get(v)) {
            if (!vis[child]) {
                dfs(graph, child, vis, count);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
