Explanation:
The provided code to find the minimum length of the string after performing the given operation has several bugs.
1. The condition `chars[left] == chars[-1]` should use `right` instead of `-1` to access the last character in the array.
2. After finding a matching prefix and suffix, the operations to increment `left` and decrement `right` should occur outside of the inner while loops.
3. The char `c` being assigned should be outside the first while loop's block.

The fixed code addresses these bugs, creating the intended functionality to accurately determine the minimum length of the string after applying the algorithm.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        int length = s.length();
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        for (int left = 0, right = chars.length - 1; left < right; ) {
            if (chars[left] == chars[right]) {
                char c = chars[left];
                while (left < right && chars[left] == c) {
                    left++;
                    length--;
                }
                while (right >= left && chars[right] == c) {
                    right--;
                    length--;

                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
}
```
