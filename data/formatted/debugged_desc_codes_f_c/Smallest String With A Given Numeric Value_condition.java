Bug Type: Logical Error

The for loop condition in the getSmallestString method is `i > n`, which will not execute the loop because `i` is never greater than `n` and `k` will not be reduced. Therefore, the char array ch will be all 'a' characters and the k value will not have the desired impact on the string.

Additionally, the expression `ch[--n] += currChar;` doesn't work as intended. It appends the currChar integer to ch[n-1], instead of appending the character with numerical value currChar.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public String getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        char[] ch = new char[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ch[i] = 'a';
            k--;
        }
        int currChar = 0;
        while (k > 0) {
            currChar = Math.min(25, k - n + 1);
            ch[--n] = (char)('a' + currChar);
            k -= currChar;
        }
        return String.valueOf(ch);
    }
}
```
