The identified bug in the provided Java code is the incorrect logic that determines the furthest index possible and the incorrect usage of the priority queue.

Explanation:
1. The priority queue should implement a Min Heap as the goal is to keep the smallest index in priority.
2. The computation of the furthest index possible seems to be incorrect, which can lead to wrong results.
3. `dp` array is initialized with `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, but this can generate undesirable results when comparing maximum sums for subsequences.

Fix:
```java
// Fixed constrainedSubsetSum
class Solution {
    public int constrainedSubsetSum(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int res = nums[0];
        Queue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> dp[a] - dp[b]); // Changed to Min Heap

        dp[0] = nums[0];
        res = Math.max(res, dp[0]);
        queue.offer(0);

        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (j - queue.peek() > k) {
                queue.poll(); // Find the global max considering the range
            }
            dp[j] = Math.max(dp[queue.peek()] + nums[j], nums[j]);
            res = Math.max(res, dp[j]);
            queue.offer(j);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
Note: The above implementation includes fixes related to maintaining the Min Heap queue and correctly calculating the furthest index while iterating through the `nums` array. This code should return the expected result and work efficiently.
