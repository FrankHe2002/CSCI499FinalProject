Explanation:
The buggy code contains incorrect indexing in the loop, accessing `nums[i + 2]` instead of `nums[i]`. This leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Additionally, the logic to update and return the maximum consecutive ones is flawed. The fix involves correcting the indexing inside the loop and updating the logic to ensure the correct maximum count of consecutive ones is returned.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.85%) | Memory: 53.3 MB (Top 85.85%)
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0;
        int new_max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                max++;
                new_max = Math.max(max, new_max);
            } else {
                max = 0;
            }
        }
        return new_max;
    }
}
```
