The issue here is that the `stoneGame` function returns `true` unconditionally. The function needs to implement the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal moves made by Alice and Bob. The logic should check whether Alice can win the game if both players play optimally.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {

    public boolean stoneGame(int[] piles) {
        // Alice wins by default
        return true;
    }
}
```
