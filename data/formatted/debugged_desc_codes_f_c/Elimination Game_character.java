The given code contains syntax errors and does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the last remaining number from a list. The logic of the lastRemaining method is incorrect and needs to be fixed. 

Explanation:
1. Syntax error: The `while` loop in the lastRemaining method is not enclosed within curly braces, causing it to iterate only a single line. The loop body must be properly enclosed within curly braces.
2. Logical error: The algorithm itself was not implemented correctly. The application of the alternating left-right and right-left removal of elements is not correctly represented in the code.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int head = 1;
        int remain = n;
        boolean left = true;
        int step = 1;

        while (remain > 1) {
            if (left || remain % 2 == 1) {
                head = head + step;
            }
            remain /= 2;
            step *= 2;
            left = !left;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```
