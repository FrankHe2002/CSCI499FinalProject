The bug in programming is an incorrect implementation in the minimumDeletions method. The issue is with the logic in the for loop where check for a balanced string is not being done correctly. The method checks for each character and adds up to a count that would reflect how many of b's should be removed if an a is encountered. However, this is not the correct logic for the problem statement

Also, the processing of `dp` array is error-prone.

**To fix -**

Cleaning up the code by providing a correct approach to the problem of counting the number of deletions needed to make the string balanced. Here's an updated version of the code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] bCount = new int[n + 1];
        int aCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'b') {
                bCount[i + 1] = bCount[i] + 1;
            } else
                bCount[i + 1] = bCount[i];
        } 

        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result = Math.min(result, bCount[i] - aCount + (n - i - 1 - bCount[n] + bCount[i + 1]));
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'a') {
                aCount++;
            }
        }

        result = Math.min(result, bCount[n]);
        return result;
    }
}
```
