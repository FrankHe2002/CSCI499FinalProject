The bug found in the code for the `numEnclaves` function is that it is not counting the number of land cells surrounded by other land cells. The logic should be updated to mark the land cells that are connected to the boundary as visited and excluded from the final land count.

The code should be updated to address this bug by refactoring the existing logic within the `numEnclaves` method. To do this, a boolean array can be introduced to mark land cells that are not counted and then include the logic to identify the land cells not connected to the boundary. The DFS search can be employed to explore the grid and assess if there exists any land cell not connected to the boundary. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 84.26%) | Memory: 54.7 MB (Top 92.39%)

class Solution {
    int[][] dirs = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, - 1}, {- 1, 0}};

    public int numEnclaves(int[][] grid) {
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if ((i == 0 || i == grid.length - 1 || j == grid[0].length - 1 || j == 0) && grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public void dfs(int[][] grid, int row, int col) {
        if (row < 0 || col < 0 || row >= grid.length || col >= grid[0].length || grid[row][col] == 0) {
            return;
        }
        
        grid[row][col] = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
            int rowdash = row + dirs[k][0];
            int coldash = col + dirs[k][1];
            
            dfs(grid, rowdash, coldash);
        }
    }
}
```

With these changes, the code should now correctly count the number of land cells from which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.
