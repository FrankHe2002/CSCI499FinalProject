Bug Type:
Logic Error

Reasoning:
The given code has a logic error in the for loop where the two nested loops are incorrectly entered. The variable `j` is used before its declaration, which should result in a compilation error. Additionally, the variable `freq` is used within `freq[j][i]` without being declared, which also will result in a compilation error. 

Fix:
1. Declare the variable `j` before using it in the nested loop.
2. Declare and initialize the `freq` array before using it in the for loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String[] words) {
        int[][] freq = new int[26][26]; // array for all alphabet combinations
        for (String word : words)
            freq[word.charAt(0) - 'a'][word.charAt(1) - 'a']++; // here we first increase the freq for every word
        int res = 0; // to store freq counts
        boolean odd = false;
        for (int i = 0; i != 26; i++) { // iterate over our array
            int left = 0;
            odd |= (freq[i][i] & 1) == 1; // means odd number of freq for similar words are there
            left += freq[i][i] / 2;
            for (int j = i + 1; j != 26; j++) { // nested iteration to find non similar pairs
                left += Math.min(freq[i][j], freq[j][i]); // taking min times from both present
            }
            res += left * 2;
        }
        if (odd) {
            res += 1; // if odd then adding 1
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
