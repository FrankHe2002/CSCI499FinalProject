The bug type in the provided Java code is an array index out of bounds error. The original code attempts to iterate through the entire matrix for the first row of the grid, while it should only iterate within the permissible indices.

To fix this, the loop in the minPathCost function must iterate from 0 to less than grid[0].length, instead of from 0 to less than or equal to grid[0].length.

Additionally, since moveCost[i][j] refers to the cost of moving from a cell with value i to a cell in column j of the next row, the helper function must be modified to adjust the value of cur as per the move, i.e., cur + n, where n is the number of columns.

Below is the revised Java code with the fixes:

```java
class Solution {
    Integer dp[][];

    public int minPathCost(int[][] grid, int[][] moveCost) {
        dp = new Integer[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid[0].length; i++) {
            ans = Math.min(ans, grid[0][i] + helper(grid, moveCost, i, 1));
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public int helper(int[][] grid, int[][] moveCost, int cur, int i) {
        if (i == grid.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int m = grid[0].length;
        for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
            int a = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            if (dp[i][k] != null) {
                a = dp[i][k];
            } else {
                a = helper(grid, moveCost, k, i + 1);
                dp[i][k] = a;
            }
            ans = Math.min(grid[i][k] + moveCost[cur * m + k][k] + a, ans);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
