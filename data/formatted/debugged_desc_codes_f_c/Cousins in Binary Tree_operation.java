There is a logical error in the `isCousins` function, as it does not check for the nodes x and y to be at the same level (depth) and if they have different parents. The correct approach would be to keep track of both the parents and levels of the nodes and then compare them.

The fix involves traversing the tree once to record the level and parent of both nodes, and then comparing the recorded parent and level to determine if they're cousins.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 20.27*) | Memory: 42 MB (Top 40.06%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isCousins(TreeNode root, int x, int y) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> parents = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> levels = new HashMap<>();

        dfs(root, null, 0, parents, levels);

        return (parents.get(x) != parents.get(y)) && (levels.get(x) == levels.get(y));
    }

    private void dfs(TreeNode node, TreeNode parent, int level, Map<Integer, Integer> parents, Map<Integer, Integer> levels) {
        if (node != null) {
            parents.put(node.val, parent != null ? parent.val : 0);
            levels.put(node.val, level);
            dfs(node.left, node, level + 1, parents, levels);
            dfs(node.right, node, level + 1, parents, levels);
        }
    }
}
```
