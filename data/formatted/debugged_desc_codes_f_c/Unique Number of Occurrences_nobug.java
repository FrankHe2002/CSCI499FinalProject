The problem is a logical error. The code checks if the number of occurrences of each value is unique; however, it only tracks the count of each value without considering the uniqueness among the different values.

A better approach to fixing the issue would be to use a HashMap to track the count of each value. After counting all occurrences, it is necessary to check that the counts themselves are unique and not just if the same count has occurred before.

Here's the fix:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean uniqueOccurrences(int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            countMap.put(num, countMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        HashSet<Integer> uniqueCounts = new HashSet<>(countMap.values());

        return uniqueCounts.size() == countMap.size();
    }
}
```
