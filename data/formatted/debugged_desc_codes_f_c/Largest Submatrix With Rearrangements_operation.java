The given Java code has multiple issues. It has two nested loops. The first loop, which calculates the maximum length of continuous ones in each column, operates on the given 2D matrix. The second loop, which calculates the area of the submatrix with maximum ones, is intended to work on the calculated result.

The primary issue is the incorrect generation of histogram arrays for each column. The original code mistakenly creates a histogram array by assuming a continuous sequence of 1s in a column. However, multiple continuous sequences are possible, with different lengths. Therefore, the approach of keeping only the length of the last continuous sequence is incorrect.

The result is the inability to effectively calculate the maximum submatrix of 1s in the intermediate histogram. 


Another general issue is the naming of the variables. It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to increase code readability. 


The list of issues identified:

1. Incorrect method of generating histogram arrays for columns.
2. Lack of proper allocation and initialization of the storage for histogram arrays.
3. Ineffective way to calculate the maximum submatrix of 1s in the intermediate histogram.
4. Non-descriptive variable names.

Below is the fixed code, addressing the aforementioned issues:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int largestSubmatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;

        // Calculate the maximum length of continuous 1s in each column
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                    matrix[i][j] += matrix[i - 1][j];
                }
            }
        }

        int maxSize = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            Arrays.sort(matrix[i]);
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, matrix[i][j] * (n - j));
            }
        }
        return maxSize;
    }
}
```
This fix includes the following changes:
- Initialize the `m` and `n` variables to store dimensions of the matrix.
- Updated method for generating histogram arrays for columns.
- Sorted the histogram arrays to determine the size of the largest submatrix with all ones.
