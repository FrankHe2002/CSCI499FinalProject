The bug type in the given buggy Java code is a logical error.

**Reasoning:**

In the provided `backtrack` function, the recursion logic for checking if a number is an additive number is flawed. The method should ensure that, except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two. The bug in the code's logic prevents it from correctly verifying the additive sequence condition.

**Fix:**

Modify the stop condition to check if the number is an additive number based on the calculated sum and length.

```java
class Solution {

    public boolean isAdditiveNumber(String num) {
        return backtrack(num, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    }

    public boolean backtrack(String num, int idx, long sum, long prev, int length) {
        if (idx == num.length() && length >= 3) {
            return true;
        }

        long currLong = 0;

        for (int i = idx; i < num.length(); i++) {
            //make sure it won't start with 0
            if (i > idx && num.charAt(idx) == '0') break;
            currLong = currLong * 10 + num.charAt(i) - '0';

            if (length >= 2) {
                if (sum < currLong) {
                    //currLong is greater than sum of previous 2 numbers
                    break;
                } else if (sum > currLong) {
                    //currLong is smaller than sum of previous 2 numbers
                    continue;
                }
            }
            //currLong == sum of previous 2 numbers
            if (backtrack(num, i + 1, currLong + prev, currLong, length + 1) == true) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

The fixed code ensures that the `isAdditiveNumber` method and the `backtrack` method work together correctly to determine whether a given string forms an additive sequence or not.
