The code is giving errors (assumed) due to complexity issues, missing import and compilation issues. 
The function length is missing the definition. The following needs to be added at the top of the code.
```java
  public class ListNode {
          int val;
          ListNode next;

          ListNode() {
          }

          ListNode(int val) {
              this.val = val;
          }

          ListNode(int val, ListNode next) {
              this.val = val;
              this.next = next;
          }
      }
  }
```
Following needs to be added in the Solution class to fix the length function
```java
public int length(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return 0;
        ListNode curr = head;
        int k = 0;
        while (curr != null) {
            k++;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return k;
    }
```
And Static keyword needs to be removed from the declaration of `ListNode oh`, `ot`, `th`, `tt` as it is causing compile-time errors and not required.
```java
ListNoe oh;
ListNode ot;
ListNode th;
ListNode tt;
```
