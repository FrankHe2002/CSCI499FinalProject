Explanation:
The given code tries to rearrange the array `nums` based on the conditions provided. However, there are several issues with it. 
1. The logic to increment `posIdx` and `negIdx` inside the loop is flawed and may lead to incorrect index updates and results.
2. The initial values of `posIdx` and `negIdx` are arbitrary (-1 and -2), which may lead to unexpected behavior.

Fix:
To correct the code, we need to implement an entirely new solution with a different approach. We can achieve the rearrangement by first sorting the array based on absolute values and then constructing a new array in alternating positive and negative segments.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums, Comparator.comparingInt(Math::abs));
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        int j = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                result[j] = num;
                j += 2;
            } else {
                result[j] = num;
                j += 2;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
