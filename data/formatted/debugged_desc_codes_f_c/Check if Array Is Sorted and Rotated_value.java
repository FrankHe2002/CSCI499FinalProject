Code Description:
The code provided takes an array nums, and aims to return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, it returns false.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

Bug:
The code has a bug at line 13, where the break statement is incorrectly placed.

Fix:
Move the break statement to the correct location where the code needs to stop iterating once an irregularity is found.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        int irregularities = 1;
        int length = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % length]) {
                irregularities += 1;
                if (irregularities > 1)
                    return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
