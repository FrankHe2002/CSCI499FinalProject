The bug in the provided Java code is the incorrect logic for counting excellent pairs using bit operations.

The first fix involves updating the bit counting and bit operations logic for finding excellent pairs.

Detailed steps are as follows:
Initialize a counter variable, 'excellentPairs', to zero.
Create a nested loop to go through each pair of numbers from the array.
Within the nested loop, calculate the count of set bits for each number using Integer.bitCount() method.
Use a bitwise OR and AND operations to calculate the sum of the set bits and operations between the two numbers.
If the sum is greater than or equal to k, increment the 'excellentPairs' counter variable.
Run the nested loop for each pair of numbers and finally return the 'excellentPairs' count.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Fixed code to count excellent pairs using bit operations
class Solution {
    public long countExcellentPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        long excellentPairs = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int num1 = nums[i];
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                int num2 = nums[j];
                int setBitsCount1 = Integer.bitCount(num1);
                int setBitsCount2 = Integer.bitCount(num2);
                int orResult = num1 | num2;
                int andResult = num1 & num2;
                int sumSetBitsAndOps = setBitsCount1 + setBitsCount2 + Integer.bitCount(orResult) + Integer.bitCount(andResult);
                if (sumSetBitsAndOps >= k) {
                    excellentPairs++;
                }
            }
        }
        return excellentPairs;
    }
}
```

The fixed code now appropriately calculates the excellent pairs using the provided bit operations and counting logic. This should resolve the bug and return accurate results for counting excellent pairs.

Note: The performance of the fixed code may vary as the provided code included runtime and memory usage details for the original implementation.
