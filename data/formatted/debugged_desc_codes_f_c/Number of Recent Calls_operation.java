Bug type: Logical error

Explanation: 
The `ping` method has a time complexity of O(n) due to the loop that iterates through all the calls. This can be optimized to O(1) by changing the data structure used to store calls.

Fix:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class RecentCounter {
    Queue<Integer> calls;

    public RecentCounter() {
        calls = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public int ping(int t) {
        calls.add(t);
        while (calls.peek() < t - 3000) {
            calls.poll();
        }
        return calls.size();
    }
}
```
