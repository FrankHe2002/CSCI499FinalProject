Bug Type:
1. Logical Error
2. Syntax Error

Reasoning:
The original code has a logical error and missing imports. The logical error is in the method 'minimumLines' where it skips the last element during iteration due to incorrect boundary checking in the for loop condition. Additionally, the code is missing the necessary import statement for `Arrays` in order to use the `sort` method.

The fixed code will adjust the boundary check in the for loop condition and add the import statement for `Arrays`.

Solution:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumLines(int[][] stockPrices) {
        if (stockPrices.length < 3) return stockPrices.length;
        int count = 1;
        Arrays.sort(stockPrices, (o1, o2) -> o1[0] - o2[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < stockPrices.length - 1; i++) {
            int x1 = stockPrices[i - 1][0];
            int y1 = stockPrices[i - 1][1];
            int x2 = stockPrices[i][0];
            int y2 = stockPrices[i][1];
            int x3 = stockPrices[i + 1][0];
            int y3 = stockPrices[i + 1][1];
            if (((x3 - x2) * (y2 - y1)) == ((y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1))) continue;

            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
