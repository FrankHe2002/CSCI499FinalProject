The bug type present in the code is a logical error.

Explanation:
The `threeEqualParts` method does not correctly identify if it is possible to divide the array into three non-empty parts, such that all of these parts represent the same binary value. The logical error may lie in incorrectly identifying pointers for the first and second part of the array or in comparing the gaps between the ones.

Fix:
To fix this issue, a different approach needs to be implemented in the `threeEqualParts` method to identify the pointers of the three non-empty parts. We need to add a check to handle the situation when it is not possible to divide the array into three equal parts. Additionally, we need to make sure that the comparison of the gaps between the ones is accurate.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] threeEqualParts(int[] arr) {
        List<Integer> ones = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == 1) {
                ones.add(i);
            }
        }
        if (ones.size() % 3 != 0) { // if not divisible by 3, not possible
            return new int[] {-1, -1};
        }
        
        int each = ones.size() / 3; // calculate the number of ones in each part
        int pointer1 = ones.get(each - 1); // end of first part
        int pointer2 = ones.get(2 * each - 1); // end of second part
        
        // calculate the starting and ending zeros at the end
        int zerosAtTheEnd = arr.length - ones.get(ones.size() - 1) - 1;
        while (zerosAtTheEnd > 0) {
            if (arr[pointer1] != arr[pointer2]) {
                return new int[] {-1, -1};
            }
            pointer1++;
            pointer2++;
            zerosAtTheEnd--;
        }
        return new int[] {pointer1, pointer2 + 1}; // return the pointers for the three equal parts
    }
}
```
