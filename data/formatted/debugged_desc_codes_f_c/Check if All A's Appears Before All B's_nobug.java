The bug type in the provided Java code is Semantic Error. The semantic error is caused by a logic error within the implementation of the function or method, leading to incorrect behavior.

Explanation for identifying and fixing the bug:

Looking at the code to find the bug and understand its cause:

In the given buggy code, the `checkString` method checks if every 'a' appears before every 'b' in the string. However, the implementation has a logical flaw causing incorrect test results. The method checks each 'b' in the string to see if there is an 'a' after it. If it finds an 'a' after a 'b', it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

For the string "ab", this implementation returns true, as expected.
For the string "ba", this implementation returns false, as expected.
For the string "abba", this implementation returns false, which is incorrect based on the requirements. The method should return true for this input, but it returns false because the second 'b' is checked for an 'a' after it.

The fix is to maintain a count of 'a's and 'b's found so far and directly returning false if a 'b' is found after an 'a'.
This approach will correctly ensure that every 'a' appears before every 'b' in the string.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 6.51%) | Memory: 40.1 MB (Top 97.53%)
class Solution {
    public boolean checkString(String s) {
        int aCount = 0, bCount = 0, i = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'b') {
                bCount++;
            } else {
                aCount++;
            }
            if (bCount > 0 && aCount < bCount) {
                return false;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
