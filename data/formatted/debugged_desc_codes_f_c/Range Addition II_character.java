The bug type in the code is a logical error due to misplaced brackets.

Explanation:
The for-loop inside the `maxCount` function iterates through the given operations and updates the minimum row and column indices. However, the return statement to calculate the maximum integer count should be outside the for-loop, but the original code mistakenly placed it inside the for-loop block.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 12.57%) | Memory: 45.3 MB (Top 7.43%)
class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        int minRow = m, minCol = n;
        for (int[] op : ops) {
            minRow = Math.min(minRow, op[0]);
            minCol = Math.min(minCol, op[1]);
        }
        return minRow * minCol;
    }
}
```
