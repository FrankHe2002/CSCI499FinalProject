The code has multiple issues:

1. Logic of approach 1 may not yield correct results because it doesn't handle collisions properly and this approach also extends the time complexity.
2. Approach 2 is a much efficient way to solve the problem and make every value unique in the array, but in the given final code, both approaches are presented. The function should only implement one of them according to the problem statement.

The fix is to remove the logic of approach 1 and its related code, keeping approach 2 intact.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minIncrementForUnique(int[] nums) {
        //Approach - 2:
        // TC : O(nlogn)
        // SC : O(1)

        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int answer = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i - 1] >= nums[i]) {
                answer += nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
