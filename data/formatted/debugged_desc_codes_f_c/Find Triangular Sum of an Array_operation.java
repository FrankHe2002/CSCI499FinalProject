The bug type in the provided Java code is incorrect mathematical operation, which results in an incorrect sum for the given triangular sum.

The code uses modulo operator incorrectly. In the method `find`, when computing the value of `a[i]`, the code uses both modulo and integer division, which can lead to incorrect results. 

The fix for this is to adjust the mathematical operation to correctly calculate the triangular sum as the sum of (nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10.

Furthermore, the method does not calculate the triangular sum correctly due to the mathematical operation issue discussed above. It should use (a[i] + a[i + 1]) % 10 instead of (a[i] % a[i + 1]) % 10.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int triangularSum(int[] nums) {
        return find(nums, nums.length);
    }

    public int find(int[] a, int n) {
        if (n == 1)
            return a[0];

        int[] newNums = new int[n - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            newNums[i] = (a[i] + a[i + 1]) % 10;
        }
        return find(newNums, n - 1);
    }
}
```
