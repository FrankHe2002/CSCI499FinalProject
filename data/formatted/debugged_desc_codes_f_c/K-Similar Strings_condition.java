The bug in the provided code is in the inner loop where the value of the loop iterator `i` and the comparison operator are incorrect. 

The nested for loop iterates as long as the condition specified is true. However, the condition provided `for (int i = 0; i >= size; i++)` has an incorrect comparison `i >= size` which initially is never true (since `i` is 0 and `size` is at least 1) hence the body of the loop is never executed. Secondly, the loop iterator should be `i < size` for iteration over the queue elements.

The recursive function `kSimilarity` also needs to be corrected with respect to the iteration conditional. 

Below is the fixed code with those changes:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int kSimilarity(String s1, String s2) {
        HashSet<String> vis = new HashSet<>();
        ArrayDeque<String> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int level = 0;
        queue.add(s1);

        while (queue.size() > 0) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {  // Fix: corrected the loop condition and iterator
                String rem = queue.remove();
                
                if (vis.contains(rem)) {
                    continue;
                }
                vis.add(rem);
                
                if (rem.equals(s2)) {                 
                    return level;
                }
                
                for (String s : getNeighbors(rem, s2)) {
                    if (! vis.contains(s)) {
                        queue.add(s);
                    }
                }
            }
            level++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    // Remaining code unchanged
}
```

With these changes, the provided code is now bug-free and will correctly determine the smallest k for which s1 and s2 are k-similar.
