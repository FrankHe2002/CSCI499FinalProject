The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The reasoning to identify and fix the bug is as follows:
1. The purpose of the code is to find the smallest index i of nums such that i mod 10 == nums[i], or return -1 if no such index exists.
2. After analyzing the code, it is found that the condition `if (index == nums[i])` is used to check if i mod 10 == nums[i], which is not correct. It should check if `i % 10 == nums[i]`.
3. The condition inside the if statement needs to be modified to `if (i % 10 == nums[i])`.
4. No change is required for the incremented index condition.

Applying the fix to the code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestEqual(int[] nums) {
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i % 10 == nums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            if (++index == 10) {
                index = 0;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
