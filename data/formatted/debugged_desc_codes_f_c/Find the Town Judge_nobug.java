The bug in the provided `findJudge` method is with the incorrect implementation of finding the town judge in the nested loops and conditional logic.

The main logic to identify the town judge is to keep track of the trusts count. Since the judge trusts nobody and everybody trusts the judge, the person with trust count equal to `n - 1` should be the judge.

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for finding the town judge. It also has unnecessary extra code.

The fixed code should be:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] count = new int[n + 1];
        
        for (int[] t : trust) {
            count[t[0]]--;
            count[t[1]]++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (count[i] == n - 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
