The code presented determines the number of good nodes in a binary tree, where a node X in the tree is considered good if, in the path from the root to X, there are no nodes with a value greater than X. 

The main issue with the code is a missing parenthesis in the 'goodNodes' method. 

Additionally, it would be best practice to add check for handling null inputs in the method named 'goodNodes'.

After making the correction, there is a slight optimization: use 'root.val' in place of 'mx' in the 'dfs' method. The 'mx' parameter is redundant and is not needed.

Fix:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 50.3 MB (Top 97.37%)
class Solution {
    int ans = 0;

    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        dfs(root, root.val);
        return ans;
    }

    void dfs(TreeNode root, int mx) {
        if (root == null) return;

        if (mx <= root.val) ans++;

        dfs(root.left, root.val);
        dfs(root.right, root.val);
    }
}
```
