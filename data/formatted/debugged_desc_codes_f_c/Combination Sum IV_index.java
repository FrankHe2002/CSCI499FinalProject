The bug in the code is that the base cases for the memoization array `memo` and the dynamic programming function `recurse` have an off-by-one error, causing incorrect results. Additionally, there are redundant computations in the logic of the `combinationSum4` method.

To fix these issues, the base case checks for remain == 0 and the memo indices need to be adjusted accordingly.

The fixed code will have the following adjustments:
- Change memo[remain] to memo[remain + 1]
- Change memo[remain] in the `recurse` method to memo[remain + 1]
- Modify the return statement in the `recurse` method to memo[remain + 1]
- Remove redundant logic in the `combinationSum4` method and adjust it to only call the `recurse` method.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        Integer[] memo = new Integer[target + 1];
        return recurse(nums, target, memo);
    }

    public int recurse(int[] nums, int remain, Integer[] memo) {
        if (remain < 0) return 0;
        if (memo[remain] != null) return memo[remain];
        if (remain == 0) return 1;

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            ans += recurse(nums, remain - nums[i], memo);
        }

        memo[remain] = ans;
        return memo[remain];
    }
}
```
