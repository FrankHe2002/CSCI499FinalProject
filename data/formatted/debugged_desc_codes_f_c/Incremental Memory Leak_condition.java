The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The condition within the while loop is not correctly checking for available memory, leading to incorrect memory allocation.

The fix involves checking if either memory stick has enough available memory left at each second to allocate based on the value of `i`. If neither stick has enough memory, the loop should terminate, resulting in the program crashing. Additionally, since the `i` value is incremented after allocation, its initial value should be 0 instead of 1.

A corrected version of the Java code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int i = 0;
        while(memory1 >= i || memory2 >= i) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2) {
                memory1 -= i;
            } else {
                memory2 -= i;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return new int[] {i, memory1, memory2};
    }
}
```
