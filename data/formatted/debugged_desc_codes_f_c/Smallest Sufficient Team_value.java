The identified bug type is a logical bug, given that the algorithm has a mistake that produces incorrect or unexpected results.

Explanation of Bug:
The issue lies in the conditional for updating the number of people required in the suffient team. The statement `if (dp[cur] > dp[i] + 2)` increments the number of people by 2 instead of the correct 1 as per the problem description. This leads to an incorrect minimum sufficient team size.

Fix:
To correct the logic, the statement should be `if (dp[cur] > dp[i] + 1)` to ensure that the number of people is incremented by 1 for each skill that needs to be covered.

The final fixed code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] smallestSufficientTeam(String[] req_skills, List<List<String>> people) {
        int N = 1 << req_skills.length, INF = (int) 1e9;
        int[] parent = new int[N];
        int[] who = new int[N];
        int[] dp = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(dp, INF);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (dp[i] != INF) { // valid state
                for (int k = 0; k < people.size(); k++) {
                    int cur = i;
                    for (int j = 0; j < req_skills.length; j++) {
                        for (String skill : people.get(k)) {
                            if (req_skills[j].equals(skill)) {
                                cur |= 1 << j; // set the mask
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    if (dp[cur] > dp[i] + 1) { // replace if better (corrected)
                        dp[cur] = dp[i] + 1;
                        parent[cur] = i;
                        who[cur] = k;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        int[] ans = new int[dp[N - 1]];
        for (int i = 0, cur = N - 1; i < ans.length; i++) {
            ans[i] = who[cur];
            cur = parent[cur];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
