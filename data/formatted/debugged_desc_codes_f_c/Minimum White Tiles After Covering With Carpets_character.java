The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The code has logic for finding the minimum number of white tiles still visible after covering the floor with black carpets, but the logic is incorrect.

To fix the logic, the code needs to calculate the minimum number of white tiles still visible, which means the code should get the minimum number for overlapping carpets or non-overlapping carpets while covering the black tiles.

The fixed code will update the function `helper` to calculate both the minimum of overlapping and non-overlapping cases, summing up the black tiles with the number of white tiles calculated, and returning the accumulated result.

The fixed Java code with minimal changes is as follows:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    Map<String, Integer> cache;

    public int minimumWhiteTiles(String floor, int numCarpets, int carpetLen) {
        cache = new HashMap<>();
        return helper(floor, 0, numCarpets, carpetLen);
    }

    public int helper(String floor, int position, int numCarpets, int carpetLen) {
        if (position >= floor.length()) {
            return 0;
        }

        String key = position + ", " + numCarpets;
        if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
            return cache.get(key);
        }

        int whiteTiles = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < carpetLen; i++) {
            if (position + i < floor.length() && floor.charAt(position + i) == '1') {
                whiteTiles++;
            }
        }

        // Calculate the minimum between covering this portion of the floor
        // with carpet and skipping to the next portion
        int output = Math.min(whiteTiles + helper(floor, position + carpetLen, numCarpets - 1, carpetLen), helper(floor, position + 1, numCarpets, carpetLen));
        
        cache.put(key, output);
        return output;
    }
}
```
