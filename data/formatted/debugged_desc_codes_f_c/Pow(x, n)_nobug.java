Explanation:
The `myPow` method incorrectly computes the power of the given number. The recursive implementation presents logical errors and does not address negative exponents effectively. The computation of the result should be based on the definition of exponentiation, i.e., repeated multiplication. 

The fix involves removing the recursive approach and implementing a loop to multiply the base repeatedly for the specified exponent. Additionally, the method should handle negative exponents by obtaining the reciprocal of the base to the positive exponent.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        double result = 1;
        long absN = Math.abs((long) n); // handle overflow for Integer.MIN_VALUE
        while (absN > 0) {
            if (absN % 2 == 1) {
                result *= x;
            }
            x *= x;
            absN /= 2;
        }
        return n < 0 ? 1 / result : result; // handle negative exponent
    }
}
```
