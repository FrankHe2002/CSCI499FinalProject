The bug in the code is that it does not correctly compute the longest subsequence that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k. 

The code should iterate over all possible subsequences of the given binary string s, and then check if each subsequence's value is less than or equal to k. Subsequently, it should return the length of the longest such subsequence.

To fix the bug, a recursive function can be utilized to compute all subsequences of the binary string.

The fixed code is:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(String s, int k) {
        return findLongestSubsequence(s, 0, k);
    }
    
    private int findLongestSubsequence(String s, int index, int k) {
        if (index == s.length()) {
            int value = Integer.parseInt(s, 2);
            if (value <= k) {
                return s.length();
            }
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Exclude the current character
        int maxLengthWithoutCurrent = findLongestSubsequence(s, index + 1, k);
        // Include the current character
        char currentChar = s.charAt(index);
        if (currentChar == '0' || currentChar == '1') {
            String subsequence = s.substring(index + 1);
            int maxLengthWithCurrent = findLongestSubsequence(subsequence, index, k);
            return Math.max(maxLengthWithoutCurrent, 1 + maxLengthWithCurrent);
        }
        return maxLengthWithoutCurrent;
    }
}
```
