Explanation:
The issue here is an unnecessary closing bracket `}` after the `for` loop `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)` that breaks the program's logic. By deleting the unnecessary bracket, the scope of the `for` loop remains correct.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countTriples(int n) {
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                int sq = (i * i) + (j * j);
                int r = (int) Math.sqrt(sq);
                if (r * r == sq && r <= n)
                    c += 2;
            }
        return c;
    }
}
```
