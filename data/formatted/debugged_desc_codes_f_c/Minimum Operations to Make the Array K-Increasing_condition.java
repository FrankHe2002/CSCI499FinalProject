Bug type: Logical error

The main issue here is that the code does not ensure the k-increasing property. Additionally, the provided code does not maintain a count of operations made to make the array k-increasing.

We can fix this issue by keeping track of the initial positions and the final positions of each window (i, n), and compare the sum of the operations needed to move from the start position of each window to the end position. The result is then an answer.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int kIncreasing(int[] arr, int k) {
        if(k == 1) {
            return arr.length - 1;
        }
        int ans = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            if(arr[i] >= arr[i+1]) {
                ans += arr[i] - arr[i+1] + 1;
                arr[i+1] = arr[i] + 1;
            }
        }
        for(int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
            if(arr[i] <= arr[i-1]) {
                ans += arr[i-1] - arr[i] + 1;
                arr[i-1] = arr[i] - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
