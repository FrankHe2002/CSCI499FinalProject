The bug in the given Java code is a condition error in the perimeter logic in the islandPerimeter method. The initial if-statement checks for grid.length to be -1 instead of comparing it with 0. This check will not allow any further calculations for finding the island's perimeter, leading to an incorrect result.

The fix for this bug is to change the if-statement to ensure it is properly comparing with 0 instead of -1. The corrected code will also be surrounded by the correct syntax and complete the solution as requested.

class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;

        int row = grid.length, col = grid[0].length;
        int perimeter = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {

                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    perimeter += 4;

                    if (i > 0 && grid[i - 1][j] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }

                    if (j > 0 && grid[i][j - 1] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }
                }

            }
        }
        return perimeter;
    }
}
