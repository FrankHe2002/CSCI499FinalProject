Explanation:
The code seems to be incorrectly implementing the condition for determining if two strings are isomorphic. Additionally, there is a duplication of the `ArrayList` declaration.

The fix is to use HashMaps to store the last index of each character as it appears in both strings. Then, check if every character has the same last index. If so, the strings are isomorphic.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map2 = new HashMap<>();

        for (Integer i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (map1.put(s.charAt(i), i) != map2.put(t.charAt(i), i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
