Explanation:
There are multiple issues in the provided `detectCycle` method. 
1. The hare pointer is incorrectly initialized with `head.next`, moving it one step ahead of the tortoise pointer instead of being initialized at `head`.
2. The cycle detection logic using the tortoise and hare pointers could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect cycle detection due to the wrongful comparison of the tortoise and hare pointers for cycle detection.

The following key points must be addressed with the provided code:
1. Initialization of the hare pointer should point to the starting node of the linked list.
2. The cycle detection logic using the tortoise and hare pointers should abide by the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to ensure proper cycle detection.

Fix:
```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode tortoise = head;
        ListNode hare = head;

        ListNode meetingNode = findCycleIntersection(tortoise, hare, head);
        
        if (meetingNode == null) {
            return null;
        }

        tortoise = head;
        while (tortoise != hare) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next;
        }
        return hare;
    }

    private ListNode findCycleIntersection(ListNode tortoise, ListNode hare, ListNode head) {
        while (hare != null && hare.next != null && tortoise != null) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next.next;
            if (tortoise == hare) {
                return tortoise;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
In the fix, we have modified the method to include the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm for finding a cycle in the linked list and corrected the initialization of the hare pointer. Also, a helper method `findCycleIntersection` is introduced to handle the cycle detection, which returns the node where the tortoise and hare pointers meet. This node represents the intersection of the tortoise and hare pointers in the linked list and acts as the starting node of the cycle.
