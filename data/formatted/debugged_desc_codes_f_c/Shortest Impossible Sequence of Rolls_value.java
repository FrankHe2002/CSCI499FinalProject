The bug type in the given Java code is a logical error. The logic used in the `shortestSequence` method is incorrect. 

The fix is to change the logic to correctly identify the length of the shortest sequence of rolls that cannot be taken from rolls. 

To fix this, we will initialize an array of size `k` to check for each possible roll, and increment the length whenever a roll matches the index. Then, we return the index where we first find an unmatched segment, which represents the length of the shortest sequence that cannot be taken from rolls.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int shortestSequence(int[] rolls, int k) {
        boolean[] rollExists = new boolean[k + 1];
        for (int roll : rolls) {
            rollExists[roll] = true;
        }
        
        int len = 1;
        while (len <= k && rollExists[len]) {
            len++;
        }

        return len;
    }
}
```
