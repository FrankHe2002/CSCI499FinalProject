The issue with the code results from errors in the calculations of nodes that are reachable and the implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.

The main bug types and corrections are as follows:
- The initial filling of the 2D array `graph` is reversed as it's filled with `-1`, which should be `0`, and vice versa.
- The distance calculation is incorrect and needs to be handled carefully to reflect the number of new edges and the remaining moves.
- After looping through the neighbors, an adjustment is necessary to update the moves taken and the edges to reflect the number of remaining moves correctly.

Based on these observations, the corrected `reachableNodes` function is presented below:

```java
class Solution {
    public int reachableNodes(int[][] edges, int maxMoves, int n) {
        int[][] graph = new int[n][n];
        for (int[] t : graph) {
            Arrays.fill(t, 0);
        }
        for (int[] t : edges) {
            graph[t[0]][t[1]] = t[2];
            graph[t[1]][t[0]] = t[2];
        }
        PriorityQueue<int[]> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        int ans = 0;
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[n];
        heap.offer(new int[] {0, maxMoves});
        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] info = heap.poll();
            int nearestNodeId = info[0];
            int maxMovesRemaining = info[1];
            if (vis[nearestNodeId]) {
                continue;
            }
            // visiting the current node
            vis[nearestNodeId] = true;
            // since we visited this node we increment our counter
            ans++;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                // checking if we do have an edge
                if (graph[nearestNodeId][i] > 0) {
                    if (!vis[i] && maxMovesRemaining >= graph[nearestNodeId][i] + 1) {
                        heap.offer(new int[]{i, maxMovesRemaining - graph[nearestNodeId][i] - 1});
                    }
                    int movesTaken = Math.min(maxMovesRemaining, graph[nearestNodeId][i]);
                    graph[nearestNodeId][i] -= movesTaken;
                    graph[i][nearestNodeId] -= movesTaken;
                    ans += movesTaken;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

The corrected code ensures that the nodes and edges in the graph are correctly processed and considered when calculating `reachableNodes`.
