There are multiple issues in the provided Java code for the `distributeCookies` and `backtrack` functions that need to be addressed. Based on the code description and constraints, the main problems can be identified as the incorrect handling of the distribution logic for the cookies among children and the lack of necessary array bounds checks when accessing `count[i]`. 

Here's the fixed code for the Solution class:

```java
class Solution {
    int ans;
    int count[];

    public int distributeCookies(int[] cookies, int k) {
        ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        count = new int[k];
        backtrack(0, cookies, k);
        return ans;
    }

    public void backtrack(int cookieNumber, int[] cookies, int k) {
        if (cookieNumber == cookies.length) {
            int max = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                max = Math.max(max, count[i]);
            }
            ans = Math.min(ans, max);
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            count[i] += cookies[cookieNumber];
            backtrack(cookieNumber + 1, cookies, k);
            count[i] -= cookies[cookieNumber];
            if (count[i] == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, the following changes were made:

1. Added the missing semicolon to complete the previous statement in `backtrack`.
2. Added an array bounds check for the `count` array to prevent erroneous access outside the array size.
3. Fixed the method signature in `backtrack` by correcting the parameter list by adding correct square brackets (`int[]`) for the `cookies` parameter.
