The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The logic issue in the `MyCalendarThree` class is that the implementation is not correct for finding the maximum k-booking between all the previous events. The algorithm to calculate the maximum k-booking is incorrect.

The fix involves restructuring the approach to better track and calculate the maximum k-booking for all events.

After refactoring, the fixed code for the `MyCalendarThree` class is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 197 ms (Top 36.54%) | Memory: 54.3 MB (Top 59.44%)
class MyCalendarThree {

    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map;

    public MyCalendarThree() {
        map = new TreeMap<>();
    }

    public int book(int start, int end) {
        map.put(start, map.getOrDefault(start, 0) + 1);
        map.put(end, map.getOrDefault(end, 0) - 1);

        int res = 0;
        int activeEvents = 0;
        for (int val : map.values()) {
            activeEvents += val;
            res = Math.max(res, activeEvents);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

The fixed code updates the book method to correctly calculate the active events and then determine the maximum k-booking. This provides the expected functionality for the MyCalendarThree class.
