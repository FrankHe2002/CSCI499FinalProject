Bug Type:
The bug is in the mathematical calculation of the area, resulting in a logical error. The bug causes incorrect area calculations that would lead to inaccurate judgment of whether the points form a boomerang.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBoomerang(int[][] points) {
        double a, b, c, d, area;
        a = points[0][0] - points[1][0];
        b = points[1][0] - points[2][0];
        c = points[0][1] - points[1][1];
        d = points[1][1] - points[2][1];
        area = 0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c));  // Changed from 0.5% to 0.5*
        return area != 0;
    }
}
```
