Code Description:
The provided Java code defines a function `numMagicSquaresInside` in the `Solution` class that counts the number of 3 x 3 "magic square" subgrids within the given grid of integers. The `sum` function, also defined within the `Solution` class, evaluates whether a given 3 x 3 subgrid forms a "magic square" as per the specified rules.
The existing code fails to accurately identify "magic square" subgrids, as well as contains several logical and syntax errors.

Errors in the provided code:
1. Indentation issues and inconsistency throughout the code.
2. Logical bugs and incorrect condition checks in the `sum` function, affecting the determination of a "magic square" subgrid.
3. Incorrect use of modulo operator `x % j` in the `sum` function.

Let's refactor the provided code to fix these issues.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numMagicSquaresInside(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length, m = grid[0].length, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m - 2; j++) {
                if (isMagicSquare(i, j, grid)) // Corrected function name from sum to isMagicSquare
                    count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public boolean isMagicSquare(int x, int y, int[][] grid) {
        int sum = grid[x][y] + grid[x][y + 1] + grid[x][y + 2], sum1, sum2;
        int[] count = new int[10]; // Using an array to keep occurrences of each number
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            sum1 = 0;
            sum2 = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                sum1 += grid[x + i][y + j];
                sum2 += grid[x + j][y + i];
                if (grid[x + i][y + j] < 1 || grid[x + i][y + j] > 9 || count[grid[x + i][y + j]] != 0)
                    return false;
                count[grid[x + i][y + j]] = 1;
            }
            if (sum1 != sum || sum2 != sum) // Changing the incorrect comparison to sum2 != sum
                return false;
        }
        sum1 = grid[x][y] + grid[x + 1][y + 1] + grid[x + 2][y + 2];
        sum2 = grid[x][y + 2] + grid[x + 1][y + 1] + grid[x + 2][y];
        if (sum1 != sum2 || sum1 != sum) // Comparing sum1 and sum2 with sum
            return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```
The provided code has been refactored to eliminate the issues stated above and improve the functionality and readability.
When modifying code, it is necessary to understand the syntax and the logic implemented in the initial version of the program. Analyzing each statement and its intended function is crucial to making correct adjustments.
