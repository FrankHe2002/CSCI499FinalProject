Bug type: Logical Error - Incorrect flattening of the multilevel linked list.

The original code has a logical error in the way it is handling the nodes with child lists. The code does not properly flatten the multilevel linked list as described in the problem statement, and it also has an unnecessary loop at the end.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 40.2 MB (Top 95.78%)
class Solution {
    public Node flatten(Node head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        Node curr = head;
        
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.child != null) {
                Node nextNode = curr.next;
                curr.next = flatten(curr.child);
                curr.next.prev = curr;
                curr.child = null;
                
                while (curr.next != null) {
                    curr = curr.next;
                }
                
                if (nextNode != null) {
                    curr.next = nextNode;
                    nextNode.prev = curr;
                }
            }
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```
