Bug Type:
The bug is a logical error. The variable `emptyBottles` is being incorrectly updated inside the while loop.

Fix:
The correct logic should be to subtract the used empty bottles after adding the gained bottles.

Updated Code:
```java

class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int drankBottles = numBottles;
        int emptyBottles = numBottles;

        while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
            int gainedBottles = emptyBottles / numExchange;
            drankBottles += gainedBottles;
            emptyBottles = (emptyBottles % numExchange) + gainedBottles;
        }
        return drankBottles;
    }
}
```
