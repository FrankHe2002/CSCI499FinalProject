Bug type: Logical

The logic for computing the profit after the first rotation seems to be incorrect. Also, there is a logical issue in the while loop conditions, which does not correctly handle the subtraction and addition of occupied customer seats.

Here are the steps to fix the issues:
1. Initialize the variables cust, cSit, and profit to 0.
2. In the loop, update cust by subtracting 4 for each gondola filled and adding the remaining customers to cSit. 
3. Calculate the profit using the updated cSit value after each operation.
4. Check if the current profit is greater than the maximum profit and update the maximum profit accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperationsMaxProfit(int[] customers, int boardingCost, int runningCost) {
        int rotatn = 0;
        int cust = 0;
        int cSit = 0;
        int profit = 0;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int prRotn = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < customers.length || cust > 0; i++) {
            if (i < customers.length) {
                cust += customers[i];
                rotatn++;
            }
            int boarded = Math.min(4, cust);
            cust -= boarded;
            cSit += boarded;
            profit = cSit * boardingCost - rotatn * runningCost;
            if (profit > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = profit;
                prRotn = rotatn;
            }
        }
        return prRotn;
    }
}
```
