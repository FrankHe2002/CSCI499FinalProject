There is a bug in the given code. The bug is that the head of the linked list is being returned without updating it after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end.

To fix this, we need to update the values of the swapped nodes and return the updated head of the linked list.

Here's the modified code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapNodes(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode first = null, second = null;

        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i)
            fast = fast.next;

        first = fast;

        while (fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }

        second = slow;

        int temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;

        return head;
    }
}
```
