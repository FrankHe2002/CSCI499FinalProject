Bug type:
The bug in the provided code is logic error. The code does not correctly implement the requirement of changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

Fix:
To fix the issue, we need to update the logic for changing the digits from 6 to 9 and 9 to 6. We should only change the first occurrence of 6 to 9 and then return the modified integer.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximum69Number (int num) {
        String s = String.valueOf(num);
        String p = s.replaceFirst("6", "9");
        return Integer.parseInt(p);
    }
}
```
