Bug type: Logical Error

Issue:
1. The code has a logical error in the declaration of the variable 'prev'. The code has incorrect initialization of 'prev' with 'nums[-1]', which should be 'nums[0]'.
2. The variable 'modified' is initialized with the value 0, but it should be initialized with -1, as it is used to keep track of the number of modifications made.

Fixing the code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPossibility(int[] nums) {
        int modified = -1, prev = nums[0], index = 1;
        for (; index < nums.length; ++index) {
            if (nums[index] < prev) {
                if (++modified > 1) return false;
                if (index - 2 >= 0 && nums[index - 2] > nums[index]) continue;
            }
            prev = nums[index];
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
