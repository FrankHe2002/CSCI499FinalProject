The identified bug in the given Java code is that the `backtrack` method is not correctly removing the last substring from the set after backtracking. This is causing the set `h` to accumulate all substrings leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug:
1. Make sure to pass a new instance of the set to the recursive call of `backtrack` method instead of modifying the existing set. 
2. Also, initialize the `res` inside the loop to avoid the accumulation of substrings.

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    int max = 0;

    public int maxUniqueSplit(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        backtrack(s, 0, new HashSet<String>());
        return max;
    }

    public void backtrack(String s, int start, Set<String> h) {
        if (start == s.length()) {
            max = Math.max(max, h.size());
            return;
        }

        for (int i = start; i < s.length(); i++) {
            String res = s.substring(start, i + 1);
            if (h.contains(res)) continue;
            h.add(res);
            backtrack(s, i + 1, new HashSet<>(h)); // pass a new instance of the set
            h.remove(res);
        }
    }
}
```

With these changes, the bug in the original code has been fixed. Now, the backtrack method correctly removes the last added substring from the set and passes a new instance of the set to the recursive call, ensuring that the set is not modified during backtracking.
