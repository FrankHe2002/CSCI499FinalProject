Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
1. The code is using i = hash.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1 to move the index i to the next position after the repeated character is found. This will cause it to skip over potential non-repeating characters and is not the correct approach to handle this situation.
2. The code clears the hash map and resets the count every time a repeating character is found. This is not the correct approach as it will miss counting non-repeating characters that come after the repeating character.

Solution:
1. We need to keep track of the starting index of the non-repeating substring and update it if a repeating character is found.
2. We also need to update the ans (length of the longest substring) once we find a repeating character.

Code with minimal changes:

```java
// Runtime: 310 ms (Top 7.97%) | Memory: 117.9 MB (Top 6.60/)
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> hash = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (hash.containsKey(s.charAt(i))) {
                start = Math.max(start, hash.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1);
            }
            hash.put(s.charAt(i), i);
            ans = Math.max(ans, i - start + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
