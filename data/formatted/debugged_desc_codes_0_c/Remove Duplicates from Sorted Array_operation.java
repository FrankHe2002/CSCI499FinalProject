The code provided seems to have a bug.
The bug is likely to be in the condition of the if-statement `if (arr[i] != arr[j])`. It checks if the current element and next element are different and if so, it should increment `i` and set `arr[i]` to be the next element. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the relative order within the array.

To fix this, we should also consider the condition where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j]`. In this case, we should skip the duplicate value and proceed to the next element in the loop.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.0+) | Memory: 43.72 MB (Top 69.8%)

class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] arr) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[j]) {
                i++;
                arr[i] = arr[j];
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```
