The code seems to be trying to invert a binary tree by recursively swapping the left and right child of each node. However, there is a potential bug in the `invertTree` method as it does not seem to update the root node after the swap.

To fix the bug, we need to update the root node after the swap. We can simply return the result of the `swap` method instead of directly returning the root node.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00+) | Memory: 35.9 MB (Top 82.69%)
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        return swap(root);
    }

    private static TreeNode swap(TreeNode current) {
        if (current == null) {
            return current;
        }

        TreeNode left = swap(current.left);
        TreeNode right = swap(current.right);

        current.left = right;
        current.right = left;

        return current;
    }
}
```
