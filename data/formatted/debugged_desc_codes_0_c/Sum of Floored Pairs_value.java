Bug type:
Logical error

Reasoning process:
The code seems to be quite complex, and it is difficult to identify the bug just by a glance. Given the nature of the problem and the complexity of the code, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate each part of the solution to identify any logical errors.

1. The function first sorts the input array and then initializes some arrays and variables for calculations.
2. It then loops through the input array to calculate the summation based on some specific logic and conditions.

By thoroughly checking the logic and intermediate variable values, we can identify the logical error and fix the bug.

Identification of logical error:
The logical error might be in the calculation of the 'tot' variable. The calculation inside the second for loop is complex and might not be covering all the edge cases.

Fix:
Refactor the calculation of the 'tot' variable inside the second for loop to ensure that it correctly computes the sum of floor(nums[i] / nums[j]) for all pairs of indices 0 <= i, j < nums.length in the array. This can involve redesigning the loop and calculation logic to cover all pairs of indices and handle the floor operation correctly.

Updated code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int sumOfFlooredPairs(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        
        long cnt[] = new long[nums[n - 1] + 2];
        for (int num : nums) {
            cnt[num + 1]++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < cnt.length; i++) {
            cnt[i] += cnt[i - 1];
        }
        
        long res = 0;
        long mod = 1000000007;
        long dp[] = new long[cnt.length];
        for (int num : nums) {
            long tot = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= nums[n - 1] / num; j++) {
                long val = (long) j * num;
                tot = (tot + (cnt[(int) Math.min(val + num, nums[n - 1] + 1)] - cnt[(int) val]) * j) % mod;
            }
            dp[num] = tot;
            res = (res + tot) % mod;
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```

The fix has been applied by changing the logic inside the second for loop to correctly calculate the total sum while handling the floor operation and considering all pairs of indices. The modulo operation has been updated, and the code has been refactored a bit to improve readability.
