The bug in the code lies in the conditions used to check the alternating pattern. The conditions for checking the alternating pattern are incorrect. 

Here's how we can identify and fix the bug:
1. The code is iterating through the string and checking if the character at each index follows the alternating pattern based on the index being even or odd. 
2. However, the conditions for checking if the string starts with '0' or '1' and the conditions for checking the alternating pattern are incorrect. 
3. The conditions should be modified to correctly check for the alternating pattern and determine the count of operations required to make it alternating.
4. The "if" conditions do not account for the case when i % 2 == 0 and the character is '0'.
5. Additionally, there is a logical error in the conditions used to check the alternating pattern.

Here's the corrected code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String s) {
        int count0 = 0; // changes required when the string starts from 0
        int count1 = 0; // changes required when the string starts from 1

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

            // string starts with 1 => all chars at even places should be 1 and that at odd places should be 0
            if ((i % 2 == 0 && s.charAt(i) == '0') || (i % 2 != 0 && s.charAt(i) == '1'))
                count1++;

                // string starts with 0 => all chars at even places should be 0 and that at odd places should be 1
            else if ((i % 2 == 0 && s.charAt(i) == '1') || (i % 2 != 0 && s.charAt(i) == '0'))
                count0++;
        }

        // return minimum of the two
        return Math.min(count0, count1);
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the conditions for checking the alternating pattern have been modified to correctly identify the alternating pattern. Additionally, the logical error in the conditions has been fixed, and the code now correctly determines the count of operations required to make the string alternating.
