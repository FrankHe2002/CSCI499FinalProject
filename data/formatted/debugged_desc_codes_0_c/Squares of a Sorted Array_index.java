The logical error appears to be in the while loop where it tries to sort the squares of the numbers in the array, but it doesn't consider that the array nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

To fix the bug:
I will change the condition in the while loop to check the absolute values of nums[s] and nums[e] since the values in the nums array are either positive or non-negative, hence considering the absolute values makes more sense for comparison.

I will also modify the condition inside the while loop to handle squaring the numbers correctly based on the absolute values of nums[s] and nums[e].

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 87.02%) | Memory: 54.8 MB (Top 82.69%)
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = nums.length - 1;
        int p = nums.length - 1;
        int[] a = new int[nums.length];
        while (s <= e) {
            if (Math.abs(nums[s]) > Math.abs(nums[e])) {
                a[p--] = nums[s] * nums[s];
                s++;
            } else {
                a[p--] = nums[e] * nums[e];
                e--;
            }
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
