Bug type: Logical Error

The bug is in the nested for loop's condition. The condition `for (int j = 0; j >= 32; j++)` will never execute because the loop's condition is `j >= 32`, which is false at the beginning, and therefore never enters the loop. The correct condition should be `for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++)`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        int[][] cnt = new int[2][32];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
                int idx = (nums[i] >> j) & 1;
                total += cnt[idx ^ 1][j];
                cnt[idx][j]++;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```
