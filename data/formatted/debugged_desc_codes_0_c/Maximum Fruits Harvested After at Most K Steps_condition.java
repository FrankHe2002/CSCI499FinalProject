Bug type:
Logical error leading to incorrect output.

Reasoning:
1. The code seems overly complex and involves multiple nested loops, which might make it difficult to understand and debug.
2. The logic of calculating the maximum total number of fruits harvested is overly complicated and may not handle all cases correctly, leading to incorrect output.

The main issue in the code appears to be in the complex logic for calculating the maximum total number of fruits harvested.

Fix:
Simplify the logic for calculating the maximum total number of fruits harvested by removing unnecessary complexity and nested loops.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTotalFruits(int[][] fruits, int startPos, int k) {
        int n = fruits.length;
        int maxTotalFruits = 0;
        
        for (int[] fruit : fruits) {
            int distance = Math.abs(fruit[0] - startPos);
            if (distance <= k) {
                maxTotalFruits += Math.min(fruit[1], k - distance);
                k -= distance;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return maxTotalFruits;
    }
}
```
