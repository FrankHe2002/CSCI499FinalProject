The given code is intended to take an array of non-negative integers, arrange them in a way that forms the largest number, and return it as a string.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the logic for sorting the numbers might be incorrect as it directly compares the concatenation of two numbers. This can lead to unexpected results.

To identify and fix the bug, I will follow the steps below:
1. Check the sorting logic used in the `Arrays.sort` method.
2. Check if the logic used for comparing two numbers while sorting is correct.
3. If the logic is incorrect, update the comparison logic to sort the numbers correctly.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String largestNumber(int[] nums) {
        String[] arr = new String[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            arr[i] = Integer.toString(nums[i]);
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> {
            String order1 = a + b;
            String order2 = b + a;
            return order2.compareTo(order1);
        });
        
        if (arr[0].equals("0")) return "0";
        
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        for (String item : arr) {
            builder.append(item);
        }
        return builder.toString();
    }
}
```

In the modified code, I have updated the sorting logic inside the `Arrays.sort` method. The new logic compares the combinations of two numbers in a way that ensures the largest number formed from the concatenated strings. Now, the code should work as intended without any bugs.
