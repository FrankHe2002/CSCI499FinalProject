The provided code seems to be correctly implementing the logic to return the maximum number of coins that you can have based on the given rules. However, there seems to be a potential bug in the loop condition where we are incrementing the value of 'i'. 

The loop condition `for (int i = n / 3; i < n; i += 2)` will skip every second element after the value of `n / 3`. This logic may not be correct.

One possible bug type here is a logical error, where the loop may not be iterating over the correct elements of the array 'piles' and therefore not following the rules specified in the problem.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the loop iterates over the correct elements and selects the piles according to the given rules.

Here's the corrected code with minimal changes:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[] piles) {
        Arrays.sort(piles);
        int s = 0, n = piles.length;
        int j = n - 2;
        for (int i = n / 3; i < n / 2; i++) {
            s += piles[j];
            j -= 2;
        }
        return s;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code:
- We use an additional variable 'j' to keep track of the index of the last pile (Bob's pile) and initialize it to 'n - 2'.
- We change the loop condition to loop until 'i' reaches 'n / 2' to make sure we iterate through the first half of the remaining piles.
- Inside the loop, we add the value of 'piles[j]' to 's' and then decrement 'j' by 2 to pick the next maximum pile according to the rules.

These changes ensure that the loop iterates over the correct elements and selects the piles based on the given rules.
