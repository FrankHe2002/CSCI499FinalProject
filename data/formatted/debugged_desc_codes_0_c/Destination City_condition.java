The bug in the code is in the second for loop. The loop runs from 0 to paths.size(), but it should be from 0 to paths.size() - 1. This will cause an IndexOutOfBoundsException as it tries to access paths.get(i) at the index paths.size(), which is out of bounds.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String destCity(List<List<String>> paths) {
        HashSet<String> set1 = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < paths.size(); ++i) {
            set1.add(paths.get(i).get(0));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < paths.size(); ++i) {
            if (!set1.contains(paths.get(i).get(1))) return paths.get(i).get(1);
        }
        return "placeholder";
    }
}
```
