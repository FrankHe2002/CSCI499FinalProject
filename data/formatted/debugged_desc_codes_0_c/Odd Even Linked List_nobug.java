The bug in the code is that it does not correctly handle the case when the linked list has only one or two nodes. This can be seen by running the code with a linked list of 1 or 2 nodes and observing that it does not produce the correct result.

To fix this, we need to explicitly handle the cases when the linked list has 0, 1, or 2 nodes before entering the main loop.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }
        
        ListNode result = head, evenHalf = head.next, evenHalfPtr = evenHalf;
        
        while (evenHalfPtr != null && evenHalfPtr.next != null) {
            head.next = evenHalfPtr.next;
            head = head.next;
            evenHalfPtr.next = head.next;
            evenHalfPtr = evenHalfPtr.next;
        }
        head.next = evenHalf;
        return result;
    }
}
```
