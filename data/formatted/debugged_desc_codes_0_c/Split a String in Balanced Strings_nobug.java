Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
The code seems to be counting the number of balanced substrings by checking the balance of 'L' and 'R' characters in the input string. However, the logic is flawed in the if statement that checks if the number of 'L' and 'R' characters are equal.

Bug fix:
Modify the if statement logic to reset the counts of 'L' and 'R' characters when a balanced substring is found. Also, update the logic to correctly count the maximum number of balanced strings.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int balancedStringSplit(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        int balance = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++ i) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'L') {
                ++ balance;
            } else {
                -- balance;
            }
            if (balance == 0) {
                ++ count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
