The bug in the provided code is in the `addOneRow` method, where the modified `TreeNode` object is not returned, making additional changes to the input object `root` ineffective.

To fix this issue, I will add code to create a new `TreeNode` when the depth is 1. Then, I will connect the original root as the left child of the new node and also make the new node as the root. If the depth is greater than 1, the function will recursively find the node where depth - 1 equals `currentDepth` and perform the required node creation.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode addOneRow(TreeNode root, int val, int depth) {
        if (depth == 1) {
            return new TreeNode(val, root, null);
        }
        addRow(root, val, depth, 1);
        return root;
    }

    public void addRow(TreeNode root, int val, int depth, int currentDepth) {
        if (root == null)
            return;
        if (currentDepth == depth - 1) {
            root.left = new TreeNode(val, root.left, null);
            root.right = new TreeNode(val, null, root.right);
        } else {
            addRow(root.left, val, depth, currentDepth + 1);
            addRow(root.right, val, depth, currentDepth + 1);
        }
    }
}
```
In this updated code:
- If the depth is 1, a new `TreeNode` is created with the given `val`, and the input `root` is connected as the left child of the new `TreeNode`. The new `TreeNode` becomes the root. This fix ensures that the original tree becomes the left child of the new root.
- For depths greater than 1, the method `addRow` searches for the correct depth recursively and adds the new nodes as required.
