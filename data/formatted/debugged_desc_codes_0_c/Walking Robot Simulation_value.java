Bug type: Logical Error

The bug in the code is related to the movement of the robot. The current approach doesn't handle the obstacles correctly, and it's also overly complicated.

Here's the reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug step by step:
1. The initial direction is set to 0 (north), which is correct.
2. The variable `dir` is used to keep track of the current direction, but it is unnecessarily complicated.
3. The main issue is with the movement logic. The code tries to handle each direction separately but doesn't check for obstacles correctly.
4. We can simplify the movement logic by using a single loop that checks for obstacles and updates the position accordingly.
5. The code fails to account for wrapping around when `dir` becomes negative. We can fix this by adding `dir = (dir + 4) % 4;` after checking the commands.
6. We should also calculate the squared Euclidean distance while updating the position.
7. Remove unnecessary calculations and update `farthestSofar` accordingly.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int robotSim(int[] commands, int[][] obstacles) {
        int[] dx = {0, 1, 0, -1}; // x direction
        int[] dy = {1, 0, -1, 0}; // y direction

        Set<String> obstacleSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] obs : obstacles) {
            obstacleSet.add(obs[0] + "," + obs[1]);
        }

        int x = 0, y = 0, dir = 0; // initial position and direction
        int farthestSofar = 0;

        for (int command : commands) {
            if (command == -1) { // turn right
                dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
            } else if (command == -2) { // turn left
                dir = (dir + 3) % 4; // equivalent to dir - 1, while handling negative numbers
            } else { // move forward
                for (int i = 0; i < command; i++) {
                    int nextX = x + dx[dir];
                    int nextY = y + dy[dir];
                    if (obstacleSet.contains(nextX + "," + nextY)) {
                        break;
                    }
                    x = nextX;
                    y = nextY;
                    farthestSofar = Math.max(farthestSofar, x * x + y * y);
                }
            }
        }

        return farthestSofar;
    }
}
```
