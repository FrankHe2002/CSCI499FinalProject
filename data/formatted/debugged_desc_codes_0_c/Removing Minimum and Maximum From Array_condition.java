The given code is attempting to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove the minimum and maximum elements from the input array. 

I will follow the following steps to review the code and identify any potential bugs:
- Scan over the code and try to understand the logic and the implementation.
- Identify any issues with the logic or potential edge cases.
- Review the variable names, loops, and conditions to identify syntax errors or improper handling of the input.

After reviewing the code, I do not see any syntax errors or improper handling of the input array.

But there seems to be a logical bug in the code. The code calculates the number of deletions required to remove either the minimum or the maximum element from the array, but it does not accurately represent the minimum number of deletions to remove both the minimum and maximum elements.

I will apply the fix by changing the approach to solving the problem as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(int[] nums) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minInd = 0;
        int maxInd = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        //First Find out the max and min element index
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > max) {
                max = nums[i];
                maxInd = i;
            }

            if (nums[i] < min) {
                min = nums[i];
                minInd = i;
            }
        }

        // Return the number of deletions required to remove both minimum and maximum
        if (minInd < maxInd) {
            return (minInd + 1) + (n - maxInd);
        } else {
            return (maxInd + 1) + (n - minInd);
        }
    }
}
```

I have made the following changes:
- Modified the condition `nums[i] <= min` to `nums[i] < min` to accurately find the minimum element and its index.
- Changed the condition `if (minInd == maxInd)` to a direct computation of the number of deletions required to remove both minimum and maximum elements.
- Removed the unnecessary comparisons and calculations to simplify the logic.

I have applied the fix using minimal changes to the original code.
