There is a bug in the code. The bug is in the comparison logic inside the for loop. The conditions in the if-else statements are not correct.

Here's the fix for the code:
```java
class Solution {
    public char slowestKey(int[] releaseTimes, String keysPressed) {
        int max = releaseTimes[0];
        char ch = keysPressed.charAt(0);
        for (int i = 1; i < releaseTimes.length; i++) {
            int diff = releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1];
            if (diff > max) {
                ch = keysPressed.charAt(i);
                max = diff;
            } else if (diff == max) {
                ch = (char) Math.max((int) ch, (int) keysPressed.charAt(i));
            }
        }
        return ch;
    }
}
```

In the if condition, use `if (diff > max)` to check if the current duration is greater than the max. If it is, update the max duration and the corresponding key.

In the else if condition, use `else if (diff == max)` to check if the current duration is equal to the max. If it is, compare lexicographically and update the key accordingly.
