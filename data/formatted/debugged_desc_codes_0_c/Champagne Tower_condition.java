The given Java code is a solution to the champagne-tower problem. This problem is about simulating the flow of champagne poured into glasses stacked in a pyramid shape. 

After reviewing the code, it seems that the bug type is a logical error in the for-loop conditions where the condition `if (i != query_row && j == query_glass) return 1;` checks if the glass is the one that the user is querying, but if it is not, it should not return 1. The condition `if (i == query_row && j == query_glass) return memo[query_glass];` is partially correct and should be handled based on actual values saved in the `memo` array according to the simulation process.

Let's modify the code by updating the for-loop conditions to correctly return the fullness of the glass at position `query_row` and `query_glass` after pouring a certain amount of champagne.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass) {
        if (poured == 0) return 0;
        double[] memo = new double[101];
        memo[0] = poured;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--) {
                double overflow = (memo[j] - 1) / 2;
                if (overflow > 0) {
                    memo[j + 1] += overflow;
                    memo[j] = overflow;
                } else {
                    memo[j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return Math.min(1, memo[query_glass]);
    }
}
```
