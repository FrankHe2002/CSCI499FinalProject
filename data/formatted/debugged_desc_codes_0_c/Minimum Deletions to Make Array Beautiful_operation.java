First, let's understand the requirements. The code needs to return the minimum number of elements to delete from `nums` to make it beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as having an even length and no consecutive equal elements at even indices.

Next, let's review the provided code. The logic in the code calculates the minimum number of deletions required, but there are several issues with the logic and syntax that need to be addressed.

The identified issue with the code is in the following line:
```java
if ((newIndex * 2 == 0) && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) deletion++;
```

Below is the reasoning process to identify and fix the bug:
1. The condition `newIndex * 2 == 0` checks if `newIndex` is equal to 0, which is not meaningful in this context. The correct condition should be `newIndex % 2 == 0` to check if the index is even.
2. Additionally, the code does not consider the edge case where `i` is equal to `n - deletion - 1` when making comparisons, leading to a potential out-of-bounds issue.

The following lines show the modified code with fixes:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletion(int[] nums) {

        int deletion = 0, n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1 - deletion; ) {
            int newIndex = i - deletion;
            if (newIndex % 2 == 0 && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) deletion++;
            else i++;
        }
        return (n - deletion) % 2 == 0 ? deletion : deletion + 1;
    }
}
```

In the updated code, we ensure that the index `i` does not exceed `n - deletion - 1`, and we correct the condition to check for even indices.
