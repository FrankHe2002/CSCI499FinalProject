The bug in the code is in the for loop where the characters from both word1 and word2 are being appended to the StringBuilder. The condition in the second if statement is incorrect. It should be `i < word2.length()` instead of `i >= word2.length()`.

This bug can be identified by carefully reviewing the for loop and considering the conditions for appending characters from both words.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int lenmax = Math.max(word1.length(), word2.length());
        for (int i = 0; i <= lenmax - 1; i++) {
            if (i < word1.length()) sb.append(word1.charAt(i));
            if (i < word2.length()) sb.append(word2.charAt(i));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
