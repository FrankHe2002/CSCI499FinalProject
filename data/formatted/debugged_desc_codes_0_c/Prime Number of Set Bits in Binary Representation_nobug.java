Bug Type: Logical Error

The issue with the code is in the isPrime method. The condition in the for loop is checking up to n/2 for divisibility to determine if the number is prime. However, it should only check up to the square root of n because if n is divisible by any number greater than its square root, then the reciprocal would have already been encountered in the earlier half of the calculation. 

Fix:
- Change the for loop condition in the isPrime method to check up to the square root of n.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int calculateSetBits(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1') count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public int countPrimeSetBits(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            String b = Integer.toBinaryString(i);

            int n = calculateSetBits(b);

            if (isPrime(n)) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
