The bug type in the provided Java code is a syntax error.

Here's the step-by-step process of identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The `if` condition checks if `idx` is equal to `% 1`, which is incorrect syntax. It seems that the intention is to check if `idx` is equal to `-1` to verify if the character is not found in the magazine. We will fix this by changing `% 1` to `-1`.

2. To address the issue of referencing the same character in the string magazine multiple times, we need to replace the character in the magazine with a placeholder (e.g., "*") after using it in the ransomNote. This will ensure that the same character in magazine cannot be used again in the ransomNote.

Below is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        for (int i = 0; i < ransomNote.length(); ++i) {
            String t = ransomNote.substring(i, i + 1);
            int idx = magazine.indexOf(t);
            if (idx == -1) return false;
            magazine = magazine.substring(0, idx) + "*" + magazine.substring(idx + 1);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
In the corrected code, the character at index `idx` in the magazine is replaced with "*". This ensures that the same character cannot be used again when constructing the ransomNote.
