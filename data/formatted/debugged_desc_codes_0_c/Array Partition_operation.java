The code appears to be sorting the array and then summing every other element, which is the correct approach for this problem. However, it seems to be missing the import statement for the Arrays class, which would cause a compilation error.

To fix this issue, we need to add the import statement for the Arrays class at the beginning of the code.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

// Runtime: 21 ms (Top 17.21%) | Memory: 54.6 MB (Top 23.48+)
class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
With the import statement added, the code should compile and run without any issues.
