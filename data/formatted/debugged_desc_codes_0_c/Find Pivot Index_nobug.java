The code is trying to find the pivot index, which is the point in the array where the sum of numbers on the left is equal to the sum of numbers on the right. It starts by summing up all the elements to the right of the index and then iterates to find the pivot index.

There is a bug in the code. The first for loop starts from index 1 and adds the numbers to the right of each index. It should start from index 0. Additionally, in the second for loop, the `leftsum` and `rightsum` are being updated incorrectly when adding and subtracting from the array.

The following is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int pivotIndex(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int leftsum = 0;
            int rightsum = 0;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                leftsum += nums[j];
            }
            
            for (int k = i + 1; k < nums.length; k++) {
                rightsum += nums[k];
            }
            
            if (leftsum == rightsum) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, I started from index 0 and calculated the pivot index by summing the left and right elements separately. Then, I compared the sums and returned the pivot index if found, otherwise -1.
