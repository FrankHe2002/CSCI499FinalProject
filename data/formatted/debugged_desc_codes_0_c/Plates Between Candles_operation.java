The code provided seems to have a logical bug. The issue appears to be in the initialization of the `numberOfPlates` array. 

The `numberOfPlates` array stores the cumulative number of plates from the left. However, the initial calculation inside the for loop does not consider the contribution of each plate. It is initializing `numberOfPlates[i + 1]` based on the same value as `numberOfPlates[i]` irrespective of the presence of a plate or a candle in the current position.

Let's correct the initialization of the `numberOfPlates` array by updating the calculation logic inside the for loop to consider the contribution of each plate accurately.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] platesBetweenCandles(String s, int[][] queries) {
        int sLen = s.length();
        int[] numberOfPlates = new int[sLen + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < sLen; i++) {
            numberOfPlates[i + 1] = numberOfPlates[i] + (s.charAt(i) == '*' ? 1 : 0);
        }
        
        // Remainder of the code remains unchanged
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the updated code, when encountering a plate ('*'), we increment `numberOfPlates[i + 1]` by 1. If it's a candle ('|'), the value remains the same as `numberOfPlates[i]`. This will accurately represent the cumulative number of plates from the left.

This should fix the Logical Bug in the provided code.
