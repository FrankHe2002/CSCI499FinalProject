The code logic seems to have some issues in identifying irregularities. The loop should iterate until the second last element, and the comparison check should be modified.

Here's the updated code with bug fix:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.6 MB (Top 54.56%)
class Solution {
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        // here we compare all the neighbouring elements and check whether they are in somewhat sorted order
        // there will be a small change due to rotation in the array at only one place.
        // so if there are irregularities more than once, return false
        // else return true;

        int irregularities = 0;
        int length = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) { // Update: iterate until the second last element
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) // Update: modified the comparison check
                irregularities += 1;
        }
        return irregularities <= 1; // Update: return true if irregularities are less than or equal to 1
    }
}
```
