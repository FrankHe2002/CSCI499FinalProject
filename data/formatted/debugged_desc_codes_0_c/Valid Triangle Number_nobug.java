The given Java code appears to be correct and free of any bugs.

The code sorts the input array of nums and uses three nested loops to iterate through each combination of three numbers. It then checks if the three numbers form a valid triangle based on the Triangle Inequality Theorem which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

The code seems to be implementing this logic correctly, so it appears that there are no bugs in the code.

Therefore, no changes are necessary to fix any bugs in the code.

The given Java code is written as follows in markdown:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int triangleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int count = 0;
        for (int k = n - 1; k >= 2; k--) {
            int i = 0;
            int j = k - 1;
            while (i < j) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[j];
                if (sum > nums[k]) {
                    count += j - i;
                    j--;
                } else {
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
