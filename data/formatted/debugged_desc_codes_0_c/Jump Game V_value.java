Bug type: Logical error

Explanation:
The code attempts to find the maximum number of indices that can be visited in the given array by using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. It first finds all the possible jumps from each spot in the array and then calculates the maximum number of indices that can be visited based on the jumps.

However, the bugs in the code are as follows:
1. The findJumps method is not correctly adding the left or right jumps to the jumpsFrom array.
2. The logic in the dfs method is not correctly calculating the maximum number of indices that can be visited.

We will fix these bugs below.

Code with Bug Fixes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxJumps(int[] arr, int d) {
        List<Integer>[] jumpsFrom = new ArrayList[arr.length]; // find all possible jumps from each spot
        findJumps(arr, d, true, jumpsFrom); // add left jumps (iterating left to right)
        findJumps(arr, d, false, jumpsFrom); // add right jumps
        int max = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, dfs(arr, jumpsFrom, i, new int[arr.length]));
        }
        return max;
    }

    private void findJumps(int[] arr, int d, boolean left, List<Integer>[] jumpsFrom) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            jumpsFrom[i] = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int j = left ? 1 : -1; left ? j <= d : j >= -d; j = left ? j + 1 : j - 1) {
                if (i + j < 0 || i + j >= arr.length || j == 0) {
                    break;
                }
                if (arr[i] > arr[i + j]) {
                    jumpsFrom[i].add(i + j);
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private int dfs(int[] arr, List<Integer>[] jumpsFrom, int start, int[] memo) {
        if (memo[start] != 0) {
            return memo[start];
        }
        int max = 1;
        for (int jump : jumpsFrom[start]) {
            max = Math.max(max, 1 + dfs(arr, jumpsFrom, jump, memo));
        }
        memo[start] = max;
        return max;
    }
}
```

Changes made:
1. Changed the declaration of jumpsFrom to properly indicate the type of List and used a type-safe approach.
2. Modified the findJumps method to correctly calculate the left and right jumps and added proper boundary conditions.
3. Modified the dfs method to use memoization to store the intermediate results and return the correct maximum number of indices that can be visited.

These changes fix the logical errors in the original code and provide the correct functionality.
