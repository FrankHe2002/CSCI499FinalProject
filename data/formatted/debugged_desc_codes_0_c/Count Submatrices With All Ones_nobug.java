Bug type:
The bug in the given code is a logical error related to the calculation of the number of submatrices with all ones.

Reasoning:
1. The initialization of the up, left, and dp arrays is correct.
2. The first two for loops (for handling the first rows and columns) and the subsequent nested loops handle cumulative counts of 1's correctly.
3. However, the logic inside the last nested loop to calculate the number of submatrices with all ones is incorrect and needs fixing.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the number of submatrices with all ones should be improved. Specifically, the logic for calculating the valid submatrices needs to be revised.

Solution:
The `dp[i][j]` calculation for the number of submatrices is incorrect as it does not properly consider the valid submatrices with all ones. The following updated code addresses this issue:

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubmat(int[][] mat) {
        int n = mat.length;
        int m = mat[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 0) {
                    continue;
                }
                if (i > 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = mat[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = mat[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                for (int k = j; k < m && dp[i][k] > 0; k++) {
                    res += dp[i][k];
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The updated code removes the usage of `left` and `up` matrices. It only uses `dp` to store the number of consecutive ones. Then, the final result is calculated by taking the cumulative sum of valid submatrices.
