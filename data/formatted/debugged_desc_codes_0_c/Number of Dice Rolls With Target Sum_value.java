There is a potential bug in the `numRollsToTarget` method in the given Java code.

The bug seems to be in the base case logic. When n is equal to 1, the method should return 0 (as per the problem statement) to indicate that it is not possible to achieve the target sum with just one die.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. Identify the bug: When n is equal to 1, the code returns -1, which is incorrect.
2. Understand the problem constraints: Since the problem constraints specify that the number of dice (n) and the number of faces on each die (k) should be at least 1, the base case for n = 1 should return 0 if the target is greater than k, indicating that it is not possible to achieve the target sum with just one die.

In order to fix the bug, we need to modify the base case for n = 1 to return 0 instead of -1.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRollsToTarget(int n, int k, int target) {
        if (target < n || target > n * k) return 0; // Add the condition for valid target range
        if (n == 1) return 0; // Fix the base case to return 0 when n is 1

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n * k + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            dp[1][i] = 1;
        }
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j <= i * k && j <= target; j++) {
                for (int x = 1; x <= k; x++) {
                    if (j - x >= 1) {
                        dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - x];
                        if (dp[i][j] >= mod) {
                            dp[i][j] %= mod;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][target] % mod;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the base case for `n == 1` has been corrected to return 0. This should address the potential bug in the code.
