The bug in the code is that it does not correctly check if the robot returns to the origin after completing all of its moves. The code only checks if the robot ends up one step down and zero steps to the right, but it should also check if the robot ends up one step up and zero steps to the left to return to the origin.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the if condition to check if the final position of the robot is at the origin (0, 0), i.e., both up and rt are 0.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int up = 0;
        int rt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < moves.length(); i++) {
            if (moves.charAt(i) == 'U') up++;
            if (moves.charAt(i) == 'R') rt++;
            if (moves.charAt(i) == 'L') rt--;
            if (moves.charAt(i) == 'D') up--;
        }
        if (up == 0 && rt == 0) return true; // Check if the robot's final position is at the origin
        return false;
    }
}
```
