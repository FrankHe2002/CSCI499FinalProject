The code appears to be correct at first glance, as it recursively traverses the binary tree to determine the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin. However, it seems like there is a bug in the calculation of the number of moves.

The bug lies in the line:
```java
count += Math.abs(left) + Math.abs(right);
```
Here, the absolute values of `left` and `right` are being added to `count`, however, this does not accurately represent the number of moves required. Instead, we should be adding the actual number of moves required to balance the coins in the left and right subtrees to the count.

To fix the bug, we need to change the expression `Math.abs(left) + Math.abs(right)` to `left + right`, as this will correctly reflect the number of moves required.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    int count = 0;

    public int helper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        count += (left + right);
        return (left + right + root.val - 1);
    }

    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return count;
    }
}
```
