There seems to be an issue with the logic in the for loop where the condition to check for lonely numbers is flawed. 

Here's the step-by-step process to identify and fix the bug:
1. First, the for loop starts from index 1 and checks until the second last index, i.e., `i < nums.length - 1`. This is correct as we need to check for adjacent numbers.
2. Inside the loop, the condition `if (nums[i - 1] + 1 < nums[i] && nums[i] + 1 < nums[i + 2])` is intended to check whether the current number is lonely. However, it is incorrect because `nums[i + 2]` will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when `i` is approaching `nums.length - 1`.
3. The subsequent `if` conditions also lack the proper logic and are not correctly addressing the lonely number condition.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findLonely(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            list.add(nums[0]);
            return list;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if ((i == 0 && nums[i] != nums[i+1]-1) ||
                (i == nums.length-1 && nums[i] != nums[i-1]+1) ||
                (i != 0 && i != nums.length-1 && nums[i] != nums[i-1]+1 && nums[i] != nums[i+1]-1)) {
                list.add(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
1. I removed the unnecessary conditions and simplified the implementation.
2. The loop now checks each number for the lonely condition. If the number is found to be lonely based on the given criteria, it is added to the `list`.
3. Also added a check for the case when the input array has a single number to prevent any unnecessary iterations.

I have also removed the percentages and additional comments to focus solely on the given task.
