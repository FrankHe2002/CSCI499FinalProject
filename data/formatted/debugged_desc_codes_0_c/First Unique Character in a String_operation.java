Bug type: Logical Error

The code logic seems to be correct, but there is a logical error in returning the default value when the first non-repeating character does not exist. The code returns `+ 1` instead of `-1` when there is no non-repeating character. Additionally, the condition to find the first non-repeating character is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to:

1. Modify the condition to find the first non-repeating character by checking the occurrence count in the HashMap.
2. Return -1 if no non-repeating character is found.

Here's the modified code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> hmap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (!hmap.containsKey(s.charAt(i))) {
                hmap.put(s.charAt(i), 1);
            } else {
                hmap.put(s.charAt(i), hmap.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (hmap.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Return -1 if no non-repeating character is found
    }
}
```
