The given code seems to have a bug. It is not correctly identifying if the password is strong or not.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to identify and fix the bug:
1. The code uses a HashSet to store the ASCII values of special characters, but it's not necessary. We can directly check if a character is a special character by using the specialCharacters string.
2. The code is not checking for the condition that it does not contain 2 of the same character in adjacent positions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check for the condition of not having 2 of the same character in adjacent positions and also adjust the special character checking logic.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public boolean strongPasswordCheckerII(String password) {
        String specialCharacters = "!@#$%^&*()-+";

        if (password.length() < 8) {
            return false;
        }

        boolean small = false;
        boolean large = false;
        boolean numbers = false;
        boolean specialChars = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < password.length(); i++) {
            char ch = password.charAt(i);
            if (ch >= 65 && ch <= 90) {
                large = true;
            } else if (ch >= 97 && ch <= 122) {
                small = true;
            } else if (ch >= 48 && ch <= 57) {
                numbers = true;
            } else if (specialCharacters.indexOf(ch) != -1) {
                specialChars = true;
            }
            if (i > 0 && password.charAt(i) == password.charAt(i - 1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        if (!(large && small && numbers && specialChars)) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

In the modified code:
1. I removed the unnecessary HashSet and directly used the specialCharacters string.
2. I used if-else statements to check if a character is a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, or a special character.
3. I also added the condition to check for 2 of the same character in adjacent positions.

Now the code should correctly identify if the password is strong or not.
