The bug exists in the for loop where the value of i can be 0 or greater than 0. When i is equal to 0, the computation for d will result in an index out of bounds exception because we are trying to access rungs[i - 1]. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to identify and fix the bug:
1. In the code, there's a conditional check `(i == 0) ? rungs[i + 2] : rungs[i] - rungs[i - 1]` which calculates the distance between the current rung and the previous rung. When `i == 0`, there is an attempt to access `rungs[i - 1]` which will cause an array index out of bounds exception.

2. We should handle the condition when i is 0 differently than when i is not 0 to compute the distance.

Here's the corrected code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int addRungs(int[] rungs, int dist) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rungs.length; i++) {
            int d = (i == 0) ? rungs[i] : rungs[i] - rungs[i - 1];  // Changed rungs[i + 2] to rungs[i]
            if (d > dist) {
                ans += d / dist;
                ans += (d % dist == 0) ? -1 : 0;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

The fix was to change `rungs[i + 2]` to `rungs[i]` to handle the case when `i == 0`. No other changes were made to preserve the structure of the original code.
