Bug type:
The bug is related to the logic of finding the "nextOfPeak" in the array. The logic for finding the next lexicographically greater permutation of the integers is incorrect and needs fixing.

Here is the step-by-step process to identify and fix the bug:

1. Analyze the logic for finding the "nextOfPeak" in the array.
2. The current logic compares nums[i] with nums[i-2], which is incorrect as it should compare nums[i] with nums[i-1].
3. Correct the logic for finding the "nextOfPeak" by comparing nums[i] with nums[i-1].
4. Update the loop condition to start from i = nums.length - 1 to i > 0 to ensure the loop iterates over all elements.
5. Fix the loop condition to compare nums[i] with nums[i-1].
6. Once "nextOfPeak" is found, the reversalPoint should be the smallest number from the right side greater than "nextOfPeak".
7. The current logic for finding "reversalPoint" is also incorrect and needs fixing.
8. After finding "reversalPoint", the swapping logic seems correct and doesn't need any changes.
9. The code logic for reversing the array from "nextOfPeak+1" also seems correct and doesn't need any changes.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        // FIND nextOfPeak
        int nextOfPeak = -1;
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                nextOfPeak = i - 1;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Return reverse Array
        if (nextOfPeak == -1) {
            reverseArray(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
            return;
        }

        // Find reversalPoint
        int reversalPoint = nums.length - 1;
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i > nextOfPeak; i--) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[nextOfPeak]) {
                reversalPoint = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Swap nextOfPeak and reversalPoint
        swap(nums, nextOfPeak, reversalPoint);

        // Reverse array from nextOfPeak+1
        reverseArray(nums, nextOfPeak + 1, nums.length - 1);
    }

    private void reverseArray(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

This code correctly addresses the identified bug by fixing the logic for finding the "nextOfPeak" and "reversalPoint" and making minimal changes to ensure proper functionality.
