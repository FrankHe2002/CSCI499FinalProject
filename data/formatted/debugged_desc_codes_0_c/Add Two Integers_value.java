The bug in the code is likely to be in the while loop. The current implementation doesn't align with the task description of simply returning the sum of the two integers. It seems like the binary search algorithm is being attempted here, but it's not necessary for the task at hand.

To fix this, we can simplify the code to just return the sum of `num1` and `num2` without the unnecessary binary search implementation.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sum(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```
