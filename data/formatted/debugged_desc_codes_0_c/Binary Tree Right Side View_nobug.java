The given code is for a solution to find the right side view of a binary tree. The code seems to be handling the traversal of the binary tree and keeping track of the level to add the value to the result list.

Upon reviewing the code, I notice that in the `rightView` function, the recursive calls are made first for the right child and then for the left child. This means that the left child will always overwrite the value added to the result list for the same level.

To fix this issue, we need to change the order of the recursive calls in the `rightView` function. We should first call the function for the left child and then for the right child.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    // Utility Function of RightSideView
    public void rightView(TreeNode curr, List<Integer> list, int level) {
        // if, current is null, return
        if (curr == null) {
            return;
        }

        // if, level = list size
        // add current val to list
        if (level == list.size()) {
            list.add(curr.val);
        }

        // recursive call for left side view
        rightView(curr.left, list, level + 1);
        // recursive call for right side view
        rightView(curr.right, list, level + 1);
    }

    // Binary Tree Right Side View Function
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        // create a list
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        // call right view function
        rightView(root, result, 0);
        return result;
    }
}

// Output -
/*
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1,3,4]
*/

// Time & Space Complexity -
/*
Time - O(n)
Space - O(h) h = height of binary tree
*/
```

With this change, the traversal will first visit the left child before the right child, and the right side view values will be correctly added to the result list.
