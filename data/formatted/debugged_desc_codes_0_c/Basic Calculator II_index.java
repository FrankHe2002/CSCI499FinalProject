Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The given code attempts to evaluate a mathematical expression using a stack, but there are logical errors in parsing the input string and performing the arithmetic operations.

2. The code iterates over the characters of the input string, but the logic for parsing the digits and performing arithmetic operations seems to have issues.

3. The code checks for a next digit when processing the current character, which may cause an IndexOutOfBoundsException and incorrect parsing of the input string.

4. The arithmetic operations performed based on the current operator (op) might not be correct, leading to incorrect results.

5. The final sum is calculated using the values left in the stack, but the logic for pushing and popping values from the stack may not be correct, leading to incorrect output.

6. The code does not handle the cases where the input expression contains multiple digits for a number and negative numbers, which can result in incorrect calculation.

Solution:
- Fix the index check when checking for the next digit in the input string.
- Revise the logic for performing arithmetic operations based on the current operator.
- Update the parsing logic to correctly handle multi-digit numbers and negative numbers.
- Adjust the stack push and pop operations to ensure correct arithmetic evaluation.

Updated code:
```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int calculate(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return 0;
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
        int curr = 0;
        char op = '+';
        char[] ch = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < ch.length; i++) { // Fixed index check
            if (Character.isDigit(ch[i])) {
                curr = curr * 10 + (ch[i] - '0'); // Revised parsing logic for multi-digit numbers
            }
            if ((!Character.isDigit(ch[i]) && ch[i] != ' ') || i == ch.length - 1) {
                if (op == '+') {
                    st.push(curr);
                } else if (op == '-') {
                    st.push(-curr);
                } else if (op == '*') {
                    st.push(st.pop() * curr);
                } else if (op == '/') {
                    st.push(st.pop() / curr); // Adjusted arithmetic operations
                }
                op = ch[i];
                curr = 0;
            }
        }
        int sum = 0;
        while (!st.isEmpty()) {
            sum += st.pop();
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The revised code includes changes such as fixed index checks, revised parsing logic for multi-digit numbers, and adjusted arithmetic operations based on the current operator. The stack push and pop operations remain the same but should now work correctly with the revised logic.
