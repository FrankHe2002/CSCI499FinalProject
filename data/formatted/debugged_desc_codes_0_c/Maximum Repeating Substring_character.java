The code has multiple issues. 

1. The if-statement is missing a closing parenthesis and a comparison operator.
2. The `s.contains(sb)` condition is incorrectly being used to check if `sb` is a substring of `s`. The `s.contains(sb.toString())` should be used instead.
3. The `sb` StringBuilder is initialized with an empty string. Since the word `w` needs to be appended at least once, the initial length should be the length of the word `w`.

Additionally, the while-loop condition should be `sb.length() - w.length() <= s.length()` instead of `sb.length() <= s.length()` to avoid an unnecessary iteration.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxRepeating(String s, String w) {
        if (w.length() > s.length()) return 0;
        int ans = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(w);
        while (sb.length() - w.length() <= s.length()) {
            if (s.contains(sb.toString())) ans++;
            else break;
            sb.append(w);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
