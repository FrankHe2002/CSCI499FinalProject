Bug Type: Mathematical Bug

Reasoning:
1. The given code calculates the area of the triangle formed by the three points using the formula: 0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c)).
2. The bug is in the calculation of the area as it incorrectly uses the modulo operator '%' instead of multiplication '*' to calculate the area.
3. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle formed by three points is: 0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c)).
4. The bug should be fixed by replacing the incorrect modulo operator with the correct multiplication operator.

I will make the following changes:
Replace:
```java
area = 0.5 % ((a * d) - (b * c));
```
with:
```java
area = 0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c));
```

class Solution {
    public boolean isBoomerang(int[][] points) {
        double a, b, c, d, area;
        a = points[0][0] - points[1][0];
        b = points[1][0] - points[2][0];
        c = points[0][1] - points[1][1];
        d = points[1][1] - points[2][1];
        area = 0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c));
        return area != 0;
    }
}
