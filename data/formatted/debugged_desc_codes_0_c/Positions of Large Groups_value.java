The bug in the code is that it is not correctly adding the intervals of every large group to the result list. This is happening because when adding the interval to the `res` list, the same `tmp` list is being used and modified again in the loop, causing all the intervals to be added to the `res` list at the end with the same reference to the modified `tmp` list, resulting in incorrect values.

To fix this bug, we need to create a new `tmp` list for each interval and then add it to the `res` list, ensuring that we have a separate reference to each interval.

Here is the modified code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> largeGroupPositions(String s) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            // Increment the count until the next element is the same as the previous element. Ex: "aaa"
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                count++;
            }
            // Add the first and last indices of the substring to the list when the next element is different from the previous element. Ex: "aaab"
            else if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i + 1) && count >= 3) {
                // gives the starting index of substring
                List<Integer> tmp = new ArrayList<>();
                tmp.add(i - count + 1);
                // gives the last index of substring 
                tmp.add(i);
                res.add(tmp);
                count = 1;
            } else {
                count = 1;
            }
        }

        // Check for a large group at the end of the string. Ex: "abbb".
        if (count >= 3) {
            List<Integer> tmp = new ArrayList<>();
            tmp.add(s.length() - count);
            tmp.add(s.length() - 1);
            res.add(tmp);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

In this fix, we removed the declaration and initialization of the `tmp` list outside the loop and instead created a new `tmp` list inside the `else if` and the final `if` condition blocks. This ensures that each interval is added to the `res` list with a separate reference to a new `tmp` list, correctly storing the intervals of every large group.
