There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the nested for loops where the condition `r <= n` is not inclusive of all valid conditions. This limits the count of square triples.

Here is the fix for the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countTriples(int n) {
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                int sq = (i * i) + (j * j);
                int r = (int) Math.sqrt(sq);
                if (r <= n && r * r == sq) {
                    c += 2;
                }
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```
