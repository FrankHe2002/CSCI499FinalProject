Bug type: Logical Error

There is a logical error in the for loop where the sum of the product of pref and nums is calculated. The code adds 1000000007 to the result in each iteration of the loop, which is incorrect.

1. In the given code, the pref array is calculated to keep track of the frequency of elements in the ranges specified by the requests.
2. Then, the nums array and pref array are sorted.
3. In the loop to calculate the sum of the product of pref and nums, 1000000007 is added to the result in each iteration.
4. However, adding 1000000007 to the result in each iteration is not correct and results in an incorrect answer.

To fix this issue, the code should subtract 1000000007 from the result at the end of the loop to ensure that the result is within the modulo.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSumRangeQuery(int[] nums, int[][] requests) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] pref = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < requests.length; i++) {
            pref[requests[i][0]]++;
            if (requests[i][1] + 1 < n) pref[requests[i][1] + 1]--;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            pref[i] += pref[i - 1];
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        Arrays.sort(pref);
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res += ((long) pref[i] * nums[i]) % 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) (res % 1000000007);
    }
}
```
