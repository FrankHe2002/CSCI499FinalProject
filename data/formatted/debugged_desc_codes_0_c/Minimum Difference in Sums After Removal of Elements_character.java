Bug type: Syntax Error

The bug can be identified at this line:
```
            sum += nums[n - 1 - i;
```
It seems like there is a typo where a closing square bracket is missing.

To fix this, we need to add the missing closing square bracket. 
Additionally, the calculation inside the square brackets also needs to be changed to `n - 1 - i]`.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
            sum += nums[n - 1 - i];
```
