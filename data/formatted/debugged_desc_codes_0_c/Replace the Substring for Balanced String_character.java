The code seems to be trying to find the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length in order to make the input string 's' balanced.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems to have a bug in the for loop where it is trying to calculate the minimum length of the substring that needs to be replaced.

Here are the observations and step-by-step process to identify and fix the bug:

1. The variable `excess` is being used to count the number of characters that exceed n/4 occurrences.
2. In the for loop, when `excess == 0`, it is trying to find the minimum length of the substring that needs to be replaced by comparing with the previous minimum length 'ans'.
3. However, there are some syntax errors in the for loop. There is a missing closing parenthesis `)` for the for-each loop. Also, there is an extra semicolon `;` after updating the `ans`.
4. Another issue is with the line `if (++ cnt[ch] == 1) excess++;`. This line should be inside the for-each loop to check for the character count and update `excess` accordingly. The character count update should also be doing `cnt[ch]++` rather than `++cnt[ch]`. 
5. The logic seems to be of sliding window where we keep a window from j to i to check if we are able to reduce the excess characters to zero. But there is a bug in this logic as the code is not updating `ans` correctly within the while loop. The `ans` should be updated with `i - j + 1` when `excess == 0`.

Here's the corrected code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int balancedString(String s) {
        int n = s.length(), ans = n, excess = 0;
        int[] cnt = new int[128];
        cnt['Q'] = cnt['W'] = cnt['E'] = cnt['R'] = - n / 4;
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (cnt[ch]++ == 0) excess++; // Increment count and check if it becomes 1, update excess count
        }
        if (excess == 0) return 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(--cnt[s.charAt(i)] == 0) excess--; // Decrement count and check if it becomes 0, update excess count
            
            while (excess == 0) {
                ans = Math.min(i - j + 1, ans); // Update ans with minimum length
                if (cnt[s.charAt(j++)]++ == 0) excess++; // Increment count and check if it becomes 1, update excess count
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
