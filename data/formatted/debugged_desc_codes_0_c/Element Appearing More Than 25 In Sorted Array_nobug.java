The code seems to have a logical bug. The issue is that the code is not correctly identifying and returning the integer that occurs more than 25% of the time.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The code initializes a HashMap to store the count of each integer in the array.
2. It then calculates the 'comp' value, which is the threshold count for an integer to occur more than 25% of the time in the array.
3. Next, it iterates through the array, updating the count of each integer in the HashMap.
4. If the count of an integer exceeds the threshold 'comp', the code immediately returns that integer as the result.

Upon reviewing the logic, the bug becomes apparent. The code only checks the count of an integer against the threshold 'comp' after incrementing its count in the HashMap. This means that the code may return an integer even if it hasn't reached the threshold 'comp' in the current iteration, but has already crossed the threshold in the previous iteration. 

To fix this bug, we need to move the check for the count of each integer against the threshold 'comp' outside the loop, after updating the count of each integer. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int findSpecialInteger(int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        int comp = arr.length / 4;
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (! hm.containsKey(i)) {
                hm.put(i, 1);
            } else {
                int val = hm.get(i);
                val++;
                hm.put(i, val);
                if (val > comp) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the check for the count of each integer against the threshold 'comp' has been moved inside the else statement. Now, the count of each integer is checked against the threshold immediately after updating its count. If the count exceeds the threshold, the integer is returned as the result.
