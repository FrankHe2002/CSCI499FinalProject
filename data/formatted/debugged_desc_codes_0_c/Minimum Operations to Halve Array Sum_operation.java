Bug Type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a priority queue to store the numbers in descending order, which is correct.
2. The main issue is with the logic inside the for loop. The current implementation divides the sum by the current element in the array, which is incorrect. It should be adding the current element to the sum instead in order to calculate the total sum of the numbers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the calculation of the sum inside the for loop and make sure that it is adding the current element to the sum.

Solution:
```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int halveArray(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Double> q = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            sum += (double) i; // Change the calculation to add the current element to the sum
            q.add((double) i);
        }
        int res = 0;
        double req = sum / 2;  // Calculate the required sum to be halved
        while (sum > req) {
            double curr = q.poll();
            q.add(curr / 2);
            res++;
            sum -= curr / 2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
