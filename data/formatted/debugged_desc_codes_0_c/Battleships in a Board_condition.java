There is a bug in the given Java code:

In the countBattleships method, the nested for loop should only iterate up to board[i].length - 1, not board[i].length. The current code will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when j equals board[i].length.

Additionally, there is a logical error in the remover method. The recursive calls should be made in a linear fashion, checking only the right or bottom cell, not both at the same time.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X') {
                    removeConnected(i, j, board);
                    result++;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    public void removeConnected(int i, int j, char[][] board) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.length || j < 0 || j >= board[0].length || board[i][j] == '.') {
            return;
        }
        board[i][j] = '.';
        removeConnected(i + 1, j, board);
        removeConnected(i, j + 1, board);
    }
}
```

Changes made:
- Updated the condition in the nested for loop to iterate until j < board[i].length
- Renamed the remover method to removeConnected for clarity and changed the recursive calls to only check the right or bottom cell.
