Bug type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The loop for iterating through the rows is correctly set up as `for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)`.
2. There's a bug in the inner loop that iterates through the columns. It's set up as `for (int j = -1; j < n; j++)`. The initialization `int j = -1` is not correct.

Step by step fix:
1. Change `for (int j = -1; j < n; j++)` to `for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)` to correctly iterate through the columns.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length, n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        int[][] path = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                //if there is an obstacle at the current block then you cannot get there
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1) {
                    if (i == 0 && j == 0)
                        path[i][j] = 1;
                    if (i > 0)
                        path[i][j] += path[i - 1][j];
                    if (j > 0)
                        path[i][j] += path[i][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return path[-- m][-- n];
    }
}
```
