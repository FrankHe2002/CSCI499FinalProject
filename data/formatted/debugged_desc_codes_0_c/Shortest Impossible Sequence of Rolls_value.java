The bug in the given code appears to be the calculation of the length of the shortest sequence of rolls that cannot be taken from the input rolls. The current implementation does not correctly calculate the length and returns a fixed value. The algorithm processes the input rolls and increments the length for each new unique roll.

To fix the bug, we need to keep track of all possible sequences of rolls that can be obtained from the input array and then find the shortest sequence that cannot be obtained.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The current implementation initializes the length (len) to 2, which may not be correct.

2. It uses a HashSet to keep track of unique rolls encountered while iterating through the input array. Once the number of unique rolls reaches the value of k, it resets the HashSet and increments the length of the sequence.

3. The algorithm then returns the length with an additional fixed value, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we can follow these steps:
1. Create a method to generate all possible sequences of rolls of length len.
2. Iterate through all possible sequences and check if they can be obtained from the input rolls array using a HashSet.
3. As soon as we find a sequence that cannot be obtained, return its length as the result.
4. Update the Solution class to use the corrected algorithm to find the length of the shortest sequence of rolls that cannot be obtained from the input rolls.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int shortestSequence(int[] rolls, int k) {
        int len = 1;
        Set<List<Integer>> sequences = new HashSet<>();
        
        while (true) {
            generateSequences(rolls, sequences, new ArrayList<>(), len);
            boolean found = true;
            for (List<Integer> seq : sequences) {
                if (!isSubsequence(seq, rolls)) {
                    return len;
                }
            }
            len++;
        }
    }
    
    // Helper method to generate all possible sequences of rolls of length len
    private void generateSequences(int[] rolls, Set<List<Integer>> sequences, List<Integer> current, int len) {
        if (current.size() == len) {
            sequences.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            return;
        }
        
        for (int roll : rolls) {
            current.add(roll);
            generateSequences(rolls, sequences, current, len);
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Helper method to check if a sequence is a subsequence of rolls
    private boolean isSubsequence(List<Integer> sequence, int[] rolls) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < sequence.size() && j < rolls.length) {
            if (sequence.get(i) == rolls[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i == sequence.size();
    }
}
```
