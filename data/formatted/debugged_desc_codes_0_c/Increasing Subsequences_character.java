Bug: The code is missing a closing parenthesis and if statement condition.

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a depth-first search (dfs) approach to find all increasing subsequences in the input array.
2. The code initializes a HashSet to store the unique subsequences.
3. The dfs method is called recursively to obtain increasing subsequences.
4. If the given list is empty or the last element is less than or equal to the current element, the current element is added to the list and a recursive call is made with the updated list.
5. If the size of the list is greater than or equal to 2, the list is added to the HashSet.
6. There is a bug in the if condition that leads to a syntax error.

The syntax error is in the if statement `if (temp.size() >= 2 set.add(new ArrayList<>(temp));`, where the closing parenthesis and condition for the if statement are missing.

Additionally, it is good practice to check each end condition before making a recursive call to avoid potential infinite recursion.

Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    HashSet<List<Integer>> set;

    public List<List<Integer>> findSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        set = new HashSet<>();

        dfs(nums, 0, new ArrayList<>());

        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        if (set.size() > 0) {
            ans.addAll(set);
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private void dfs(int nums[], int start, List<Integer> temp) {
        if (temp.size() >= 2) {
            set.add(new ArrayList<>(temp));
        }

        if (start == nums.length) return;

        HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if ((temp.size() == 0 || temp.get(temp.size() - 1) <= nums[i]) && !seen.contains(nums[i])) {
                seen.add(nums[i]);
                temp.add(nums[i]);
                
                dfs(nums, i + 1, temp);
                temp.remove(temp.size() - 1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The bug is fixed by adding the missing parenthesis and the condition for checking if the current list has at least 2 elements before adding it to the set. Additionally, a HashSet "seen" is used to avoid duplicate subsequences, ensuring no duplicates.
