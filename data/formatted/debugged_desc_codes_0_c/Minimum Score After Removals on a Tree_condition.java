The bug here is in the `minimumScore` method, where the loop that iterates through the nodes for calculating the minimum score is not correct. It fails to compute the correct number of iterations, because it uses `adjGraph.keySet().size()` when it should instead use the length of the `nums` array, the size of `xorMap`, or the length of the edges to decide the number of iterations.

To fix this, you should calculate the size using either `nums.length`, `xorMap.size()`, or `edges.length`. One of these should be used as they represent the number of nodes in the graph. Then, replace `adjGraph.keySet().size()` with the correct value in the loop conditions and loop iterations. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
public int minimumScore(int[] nums, int[][] edges) {
  // ... (Code omitted for brevity)

  int minScore = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

  // Calculate the size of the graph
  int graphSize = nums.length;

  for (int i = 1; i < graphSize; i++) {
      for (int j = i + 1; j < graphSize; j++) {
          // Is node_i parent of node_j
          if (descendants.get(i).contains(j)) {
              // remaining logic
          } else if (descendants.get(j).contains(i)) {
              // remaining logic
          } else {
              // remaining logic
          }
      }
  }

  return minScore;
}
```

With this change, we're now iterating through the correct number of nodes in the tree, ensuring the correct computation of the minimum score.
