Bug Type:
The bug type in this code is a logical error. The rob_ method is not correctly calculating the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

Reasoning:
1. The rob_ method seems to be computing the total amount of money robbed with and without the current node, but the logic might be flawed.
2. Review the logic to ensure that the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police is being accurately calculated.

Fix:
I will update the rob_ method to properly track the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    static class Pair {
        int withRob = 0;
        int withoutRob = 0;
    }

    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        Pair nodeRob = rob_(root);
        return Math.max(nodeRob.withRob, nodeRob.withoutRob);
    }

    public Pair rob_(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new Pair();
        }

        Pair l = rob_(root.left);
        Pair r = rob_(root.right);

        Pair nodeRob = new Pair();
        nodeRob.withRob = root.val + l.withoutRob + r.withoutRob;
        nodeRob.withoutRob = Math.max(l.withRob, l.withoutRob) + Math.max(r.withRob, r.withoutRob);
        
        return nodeRob;
    }
}
