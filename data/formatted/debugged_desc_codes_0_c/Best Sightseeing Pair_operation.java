Bug type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
The code is not correctly calculating the score for each pair of sightseeing spots. It is only calculating the score for one spot at a time, not accounting for the distance between the two spots.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum score using two nested loops to calculate the score for each pair of sightseeing spots.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScoreSightseeingPair(int[] values) {
        int n = values.length;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int score = values[i] + values[j] + i - j;
                ans = Math.max(ans, score);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
