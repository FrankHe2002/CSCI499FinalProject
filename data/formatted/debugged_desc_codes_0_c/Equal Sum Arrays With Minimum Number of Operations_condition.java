The code logic seems correct, but there may be a bug in the `minOperations` method, in the condition checking for the edge cases where it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal.

Let's start with the bug identification:

1. The condition `if (m >= 6 * n || n > 6 * m) return - 1;` checks if it's not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal. 

2. In the condition `m >= 6 * n`, the inequality is not correctly handling the edge case when `n = 1` and `m = 6`. In this case, the condition should allow for an operation to be performed to make the sums equal.

3. In the condition `n > 6 * m`, it seems to be reversed. It should be checking if `m > 6 * n`.

Now, let's fix the identified bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int m = nums1.length, n = nums2.length;
        if (m > 6 * n || n > 6 * m) return -1; // Fix: Modified the conditions

        int sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
        for (int i : nums1) sum1 += i;
        for (int i : nums2) sum2 += i;

        int diff = sum1 - sum2;
        if (diff == 0) return 0;

        return (diff > 0 ? helper(nums1, nums2, diff)
                : helper(nums2, nums1, -diff));
    }

    private int helper(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int diff) {
        // count[i] : frequency of numbers that can reduce the diff by i
        int[] count = new int[6];
        for (int num : nums1) count[num - 1]++;
        for (int num : nums2) count[6 - num]++;

        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 5; i > 0; i--) {
            int c = Math.min(count[i], diff / i + (diff % i == 0 ? 0 : 1));

            res += c;
            diff -= c * i;

            if (diff <= 0) break;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

With the fix in place, the condition now accurately checks for the situations where it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal.
