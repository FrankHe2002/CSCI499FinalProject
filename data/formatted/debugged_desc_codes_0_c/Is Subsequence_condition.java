The bug in the given code is that the condition for comparing the length of strings s and t is incorrect. It checks if the length of s is less than or equal to the length of t and if so, it returns false. This is incorrect because if s is a subsequence of t, then the length of s should be less than or equal to the length of t.

To fix this bug, I will change the condition to check if the length of s is greater than or equal to the length of t. If this condition is true, it means that s cannot be a subsequence of t, so the function should return false. If the condition is false, then it will proceed with the logic to check for subsequence.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i, x, p = - 1;
        if (s.length() > t.length())
            return false;
        for (i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            x = t.indexOf(s.charAt(i), p + 1);
            if (x > p)
                p = x;
            else
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
