Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
The cleanUpStack method is not returning the correct sum of the values of each non-leaf node. It should calculate the maximum value of the array to ensure the inclusion of all nodes in the calculation.

The calculation process is incorrect and does not accurately calculate the sum of the non-leaf node values, leading to an incorrect result.

The "target" value of 17 is an arbitrary value that is not related to the problem context. It should be related to the maximum value in the array.

Fix:
1. Update the cleanUpStack method to consider the maximum value of the array as the target for the non-leaf nodes.
2. Remove the arbitrary check for the "target" value of 17 and use the maximum value of the array for the calculation.

The revised code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int mctFromLeafValues(int[] arr) {
        int sum = 0;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            sum += cleanUpStack(num, stack);
        }
        sum += cleanUpStack(Integer.MAX_VALUE, stack);

        return sum;
    }

    private int cleanUpStack(int target, Stack<Integer> stack) {
        int last = target;
        int sum = 0;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= target) {
            int cur = stack.pop();
            sum += last * cur;
            last = cur;
        }
        sum += target * last;
        stack.push(target);
        return sum;
    }
}
```
After the implementation of the fix, the logic in the code has been corrected to accurately calculate the sum of the non-leaf node values. The method now uses the maximum value of the array as the target for non-leaf nodes and includes all elements in the calculation.
