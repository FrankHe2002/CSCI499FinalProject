The bug in the given code is the incorrect calculation of the binary concatenation. 

To fix this bug, we need to first convert each number i to a binary string, and then concatenate the binary strings to form a single binary string. Finally, we can convert the concatenated binary string to a decimal integer.

Here's how we can fix the bug step-by-step:
1. Initialize a StringBuilder to store the concatenated binary string.
2. Inside the for loop, convert each number i to a binary string using Integer.toBinaryString(i) and append it to the StringBuilder.
3. After the loop, convert the StringBuilder to a string and then to a long integer using Long.parseLong(concatenatedBinary, 2).
4. Take the modulo 109 + 7 of the long integer and return it as an integer.

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
// Runtime: 613 ms (Top 30.00%) | Memory: 117.4 MB (Top 18.57%)
class Solution {
    public int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
        long res = 0;
        StringBuilder concatenatedBinary = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            concatenatedBinary.append(Integer.toBinaryString(i));
        }
        res = Long.parseLong(concatenatedBinary.toString(), 2) % 1000000007;
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```

With these changes, the bug in the code is fixed and the concatenation of binary numbers is done correctly. Now the code should work as intended.
