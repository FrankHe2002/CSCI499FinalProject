The code provided seems to be logical and does not contain any syntax errors or obvious bugs. The algorithm keeps track of the visited coordinates using a HashSet and checks if the current position has been visited before, returning true if it has.

If there are any bugs in the code, they would likely be in the logic of how the coordinates are updated or in the condition for checking if the current position has been visited.

After careful inspection, the logic of updating the coordinates seems correct, and the condition for checking visited coordinates also seems correct. Therefore, the code appears to be free of bugs.

No changes are needed for fixing potential bugs in the provided code as it looks correct.
