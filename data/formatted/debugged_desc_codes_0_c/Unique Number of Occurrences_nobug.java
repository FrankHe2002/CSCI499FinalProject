The given Java code is attempting to determine if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique. Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the bug may be in the logic for checking the uniqueness of occurrences.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The code is sorting the array 'arr', which is not necessary for this problem. So, the sorting line can be removed.
2. The HashSet 'set' is used to keep track of the unique occurrences of values in the array.
3. The variable 'c' is used to count the occurrences of each value in the array.
4. The for loop iterates through the array and checks if each value has a unique number of occurrences.
5. If the current value is the same as the previous value, the count 'c' is incremented.
6. If the current value is different from the previous value, the count 'c' is added to the 'set'.
7. After the loop, the last count 'c' is also added to the 'set'.
8. Finally, if the 'set' contains any count value more than once, the function returns false, indicating that the number of occurrences is not unique.

The bug in the current code is that it is not correctly checking for the uniqueness of occurrences. The logic for adding the count 'c' to the 'set' and checking for uniqueness needs to be modified.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean uniqueOccurrences(int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> countOccurrences = new HashMap<>();
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            countOccurrences.put(arr[i], countOccurrences.getOrDefault(arr[i], 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (int count : countOccurrences.values()) {
            if (set.contains(count)) {
                return false;
            }
            set.add(count);
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

I have made the following changes to the code:
1. Removed the unnecessary sorting of the array.
2. Used a HashMap to count the occurrences of each value in the array.
3. Checked the uniqueness of occurrences using a HashSet and returned false if a count is already present in the HashSet.
4. Updated the return statement to return true if all unique occurrences are found in the HashSet.

With these changes, the code should now correctly determine if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.
