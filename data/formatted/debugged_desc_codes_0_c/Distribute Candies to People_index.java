Bug type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
1. The code has a logical issue where it is trying to access an index that is out of bounds of the array.
2. This is happening at line `a[i + 2] += k;` where the index `i + 2` can exceed the array bounds.

Solution:
1. We need to make sure that the index `i + 2` stays within the bounds of the array.
2. One way to fix this is by using the modulus operator to wrap around the array index.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {
        int n = num_people;
        int a[] = new int[n];
        int k = 1;
        int i = 0;
        while (candies > 0) {
            if (candies >= k) {
                a[i % n] += k;
                candies -= k;
            } else {
                a[i % n] += candies;
                candies = 0;
            }
            k++;
            i++;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
