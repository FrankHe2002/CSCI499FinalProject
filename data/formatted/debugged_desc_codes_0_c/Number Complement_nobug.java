The bug in the given Java code is in the logic for finding the complement of the integer. The logic is incorrect as it is not actually flipping the bits in the binary representation to find the complement.

To fix the bug, we need to change the logic for finding the complement by flipping the bits in the binary representation of the input integer.

Here's the fix for the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int mask = (Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1;
        return ~num & mask;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
- We use Integer.highestOneBit(num) to find the leftmost set bit in the binary representation of num, then shift it left by 1 and subtract 1 to get a bit mask with all bits set up to the position of the leftmost set bit.
- We then use the bitwise complement operator ~ to flip all the bits in the binary representation of num, and then bitwise AND with the mask to get the complement of num.

This logic now correctly finds the complement of the input integer using bitwise operations.
