Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a min-heap to perform k negations on the elements of the array nums. However, there is a logical error in the final while loop that calculates the sum. It mistakenly uses the modulo operator (%) instead of the addition operator (+).
2. Additionally, the code does not correctly calculate the sum after removing the negated elements from the minHeap.

Fix:
1. Change the usage of the modulo operator to the addition operator to calculate the sum.
2. Change the while loop to add the absolute value of the element to the sum.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 9 ms (Top 31.54%) | Memory: 43.4 MB (Top 14.91%)
class Solution {
    public int largestSumAfterKNegations(int[] nums, int k) {

        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int val : nums) minHeap.add(val);

        while (k > 0) {
            int curr = minHeap.poll();
            minHeap.add(-curr);
            k--;
        }

        int sum = 0;
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            sum += Math.abs(minHeap.poll());
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
