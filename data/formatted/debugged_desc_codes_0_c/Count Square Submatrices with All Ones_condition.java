The bug in the provided code is in the for loop condition `for (int i = 1; i >= m; i++)`. The condition `i >= m` is causing an issue because it is preventing the loop from being executed since `1` is not greater than or equal to `m`. This is clearly a typo, as it should be `i < m` to iterate through the rows of the matrix.

To fix this bug, the condition in the for loop should be changed to `for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)` so that it correctly iterates through the rows of the matrix.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSquares(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] res = new int[m][n];

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            res[0][j] = matrix[0][j];

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            res[i][0] = matrix[i][0];

        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                    res[i][j] = Math.min(res[i - 1][j], Math.min(res[i][j - 1], res[i - 1][j - 1])) + 1;
                } else
                    res[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += res[i][j];
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```
