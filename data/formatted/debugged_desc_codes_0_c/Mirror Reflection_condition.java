The given code is using a while loop to continually divide p and q by 2 while p is even and q is odd. Then it returns 1 - p % 2 + q % 2 as the result.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the bug is in the while condition. The condition should be p % 2 == 0 && q % 2 == 0 instead of p % 2 == 0 && q % 2 != 0. When p is even and q is odd, it should continue the loop, not stop it.

Let's fix the while condition and the return statement:

```java
class Solution {
    public int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        while (p % 2 == 0 && q % 2 == 0) {
            p >>= 1;
            q >>= 1;
        }
        return 1 - p % 2 + q % 2;
    }
}
```

Now the code should work correctly to find the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.
