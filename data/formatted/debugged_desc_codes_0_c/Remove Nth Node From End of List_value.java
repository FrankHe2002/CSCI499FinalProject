Bug type:
The bug in the code is a logical error that does not properly handle the edge case where the node to be removed is the first node in the list.

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes a temporary variable "temp" to traverse the linked list and counts the length of the list.
2. After counting the length, the logic to handle the case where the node to be removed is the first node is not handled correctly.
3. When "frontlen" is 0, it means that the first node needs to be removed, so the logic to update the "head" pointer is incorrect.
4. Lastly, the code returns the original "head" but may not reflect the correct changes after removing the node from the list.

Code in markdown with minimal changes:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode temp = head;
        int len = 0;

        if (head == null) {
            return null;
        }

        while (temp != null) {
            temp = temp.next;
            len++;
        }

        if (len == n) {
            return head.next;
        }

        int frontlen = len - n;
        
        if (frontlen == 0) {
            return head.next;
        }

        ListNode first = head;
        ListNode second = null;

        for (int i = 0; i < frontlen; i++) {
            second = first;
            first = first.next;
        }

        if (second != null) {
            second.next = first.next;
        } else {
            head = head.next;
        }

        return head;
    }
}
