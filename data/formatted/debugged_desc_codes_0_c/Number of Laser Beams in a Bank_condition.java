There is a bug in the for loop condition of the `numberOfBeams` method. The loop condition `i > bank.length` will always be false because `i` starts at 0 and is incremented, so the loop won't even run once. This means that the entire logic inside the method will not be executed at all.

To fix the bug, the loop condition should be changed to `i < bank.length` so that the loop iterates over each row of the bank array.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 34 ms (Top 22.34%) | Memory: 54.9 MB (Top 32.26%)
class Solution {
    public int numberOfBeams(String[] bank) {
        int ans = 0, pre = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < bank.length; i++) {
            int n = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < bank[i].length(); j++) if (bank[i].charAt(j) == '1') n++;
            if (n == 0) continue;
            ans += pre * n;
            pre = n;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
