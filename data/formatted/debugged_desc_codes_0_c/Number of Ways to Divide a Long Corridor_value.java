The logic in the given code calculates the number of ways to divide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, but there is a bug that needs to be fixed. 

After initializing the variables `numSeats` and `numPlants` to 0 and `dividers` to 1, the code iterates through the input string `corridor`. For each position, it updates `numSeats` and `numPlants` based on the current character in the string. If there are 2 seats and 1 plant encountered, the `dividers` variable is updated. However, there is a bug in the logic that calculates the `dividers` when the condition `numSeats == 3` is met. Additionally, the manipulation of `numSeats` and `numPlants` inside the condition is incorrect and may not achieve the desired results.

To fix this bug and correctly handle the counting of dividers, the logic needs to be changed inside the loop.

Here's the revised and fixed code in its entirety:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfWays(String corridor) {
        int numSeats = 0, numPlants = 0;
        long dividers = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < corridor.length(); ++ i) {
            if (corridor.charAt(i) == 'S') {
                numSeats += 1;
            } else {
                numPlants += 1;
            }
            if (numSeats == 2) {
                dividers = (dividers * (numPlants + 1)) % 1000000007;
                numSeats = 1;
                numPlants = 0;
            }
        }

        if (numSeats != 0) {
            return (int) dividers;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
In the revised code:
- Inside the loop, I check if the character is 'S', then `numSeats` is incremented by 1, otherwise, `numPlants` is incremented by 1.
- After that check, I verify if `numSeats` equals 2, then I update `dividers` and reset counters `numSeats` and `numPlants` as expected.
- Finally, I also handle the case when `numSeats` is not 0, as the old code was just returning 0 without considering all the possibilities. If `numSeats` is not 0, then 0 should be returned.

These changes should fix the bug and correctly calculate the number of ways to divide the corridor.
