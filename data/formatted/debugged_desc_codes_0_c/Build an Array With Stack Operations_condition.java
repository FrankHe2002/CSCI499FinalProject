The bug in the code seems to be in the while loop condition. The condition should be "j < target.length" instead of "j <= target.length" because the index j should only go up to the length of the target array, not beyond it.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> buildArray(int[] target, int n) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int i = 1, j = 0;
        while (j < target.length) {
            result.add("Push");
            if (i == target[j]) {
                j++;
            } else {
                result.add("Pop");
            }
            i++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
With this change, the code should now work correctly, following the rules for building the target array using the given stack operations.
