The bug in the provided Java code is that it does not handle the case where the head node has the value equal to val. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the head node itself has a value equal to val before entering the while loop. If it does, we should move the head pointer to the next node.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        while (head != null && head.val == val) {
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            if (current.next.val == val) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            } else {
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```
