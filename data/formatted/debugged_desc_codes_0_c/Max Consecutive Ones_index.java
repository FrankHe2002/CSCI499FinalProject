The identified bug in the given code is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows:
1. Loop through the code logic step by step and identify where the issue might be occurring.
2. The for loop is iterating through the array `nums`, and the issue is likely happening within the loop where `nums[i + 2]` is accessed. This can cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because the index `i + 2` might go out of bounds of the array.
3. The if condition `if (nums[i + 2] == 1)` should be modified to `if (i + 2 < nums.length && nums[i + 2] == 1)` to ensure that the index `i + 2` is within the bounds of the array before accessing it.

Here's the modified code with the fixed bug.

```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 25.35%) | Memory: 56.8 MB (Top 44.29%)
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0;
        int new_max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i + 2 < nums.length && nums[i + 2] == 1) {
                max++;
            } else {
                if (max > new_max) {
                    new_max = max;
                }
                max = 0;
            }
        }
        if (max < new_max)
            return new_max;
        else
            return max;
    }
}
```
