The code seems to be attempting to delete a node from a singly-linked list by copying the value of the next node into the current node and then changing the current node's next pointer to skip the next node.

The bug in the code is that it doesn't actually delete the node, it only copies the value and skips the next node. This violates the requirement of the function to delete the specified node.

To fix the bug, we should change the value of the current node to the value of the next node and then change the next pointer of the current node to point to the node after the next node.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```

This fix simply swaps the value of the current node with the value of the next node, and then updates the next pointer of the current node to skip the next node, effectively deleting it.
