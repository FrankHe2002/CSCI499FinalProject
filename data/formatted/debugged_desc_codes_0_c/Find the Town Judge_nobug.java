The code has a bug in the logic for finding the town judge. The variable jud will store the last person in the array y, which is not necessarily the town judge. Additionally, the last if statement fails to account for the town judge not being the person with the maximum number of trusts.


To fix the bug:
1. Remove the code that prints all y[i] values as it is not necessary.

2. Fix the logic for finding the town judge by:
   - Storing the sum of the edge trusts from each person in an auxiliary array.
   - Finding the person with the maximum sum of trusts, which would be the town judge.

3. Refactor the code to return -1, the judge's label, or 1 if the town judge trust no one and is trusted by everyone.

Here's the updated code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] trustsReceived = new int[n + 1];
        int[] trustsGiven = new int[n + 1];
        
        for (int[] pair : trust) {
            int a = pair[0];
            int b = pair[1];
            trustsGiven[a]++;
            trustsReceived[b]++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (trustsReceived[i] == n - 1 && trustsGiven[i] == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
