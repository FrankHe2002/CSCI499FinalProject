Bug:
The bug in the code is related to the comparison used in the TreeSet for determining the order of elements. The comparison function used for the TreeSet contains a logic error that could lead to incorrect ordering of elements.

Fix:
The fix involves modifying the comparison logic used in the TreeSet to correctly order the elements based on their minimum distance to the closest person. The comparison function should return a negative value if the first element should come before the second element, and a positive value if the second element should come before the first element. The use of "distB - distA" in the comparison logic is causing the issue, so it needs to be changed to "distA - distB" to correctly order the elements.

```java
class ExamRoom {

    private final int max;
    private final TreeSet<Interval> available;
    private final TreeSet<Integer> taken;

    public ExamRoom(int n) {
        this.max = n - 1;
        this.available = new TreeSet<>((a, b) -> {
            var distA = getMinDistance(a);
            var distB = getMinDistance(b);
            return distA != distB ? distB - distA : a.s - b.s;
        });
        this.available.add(new Interval(0, max));
        this.taken = new TreeSet<>();
    }

    // ... (Other methods remain the same)
}
```
