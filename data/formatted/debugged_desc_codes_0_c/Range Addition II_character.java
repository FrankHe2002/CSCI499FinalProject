The bug in this code is a logic error. In the for loop, the code should find the minimum row count and the minimum column count, but it is not calculating it correctly. This is because the return statement is inside the for loop which causes the function to return prematurely.

To fix this, the return statement should be outside of the for loop.

Here is the revised code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 12.57%) | Memory: 45.3 MB (Top 7.43%)
class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        int minRow = m, minCol = n;
        for (int[] op : ops) {
            minRow = Math.min(minRow, op[0]);
            minCol = Math.min(minCol, op[1]);
        }
        return minRow * minCol;
    }
}
```
