The given code is attempting to find universal strings from words1 by checking if each string is a subset of all the strings in words2 using the count() method to count the frequency of each character. However, there is a logical issue in the second for loop where the code is breaking the loop when the condition `if (a[i] >= bmax[i])` is satisfied.

Here's the step-by-step process to identify and fix the bug:
1. The count() method counts the frequency of each character in a given string and returns an array of length 26 representing the alphabet.
2. The wordSubsets() method initializes an array bmax with the count of an empty string (which has zero frequency of all characters).
3. It then iterates through each word in words2 and updates bmax with the maximum frequency of each character present in any of the words in words2.
4. After that, it iterates through each word in words1, counts the frequency of each character, and checks whether it's a subset of the updated bmax. If it's a subset for all characters, it adds the word to the result list.

The bug occurs in the second for loop of the wordSubsets() method. The condition `if (a[i] >= bmax[i])` should not immediately break the loop because the goal is to check if all characters in a are present in bmax. Breaking the loop immediately will cause incorrect results.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> wordSubsets(String[] words1, String[] words2) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] bmax = count("");
        for (String w2 : words2) {
            int[] b = count(w2);
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                bmax[i] = Math.max(bmax[i], b[i]);
            }
        }
        for (String w1 : words1) {
            int[] a = count(w1);
            int i;
            for (i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (a[i] < bmax[i]) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (i == 26) {
                list.add(w1);
            }
        }
        return list;
    }

    public int[] count(String s) {
        int[] ans = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            ans[c - 'a']++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
In the corrected code, the loop now iterates through all characters of the alphabet in the second for loop in the wordSubsets() method. It checks if the count of each character in a is less than the count of the same character in bmax. If so, it breaks the loop and moves to the next word. If the loop completes successfully, it means all characters in a are present in bmax and the word is added to the result list.
