Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
1. The code is intended to return the maximum sum for a non-empty subarray with at most one element deletion.
2. The prefixSum array is created to store the cumulative sum of the elements in the input array.
3. The code iterates through the array to find the maximum sum, but it incorrectly updates the `ans` variable outside the loop, making the deletion of an element redundant. Additionally, the left and right prefix sums are being calculated incorrectly by using the wrong variable for array length.

I will fix the code by updating the logic for finding the maximum sum with at most one element deletion.
After finding the prefix sum array, I will iterate through the input array and check for negative elements. If a negative element is found, I will calculate the maximum sum with only that element deleted and update the `ans` variable accordingly.

Here's the modified code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumSum(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] prefixSum = new int[n + 1];
        prefixSum[0] = 0;
        int ans = arr[0]; // Initialize ans with the first element of the array
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + arr[i - 1];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int sum = arr[i];
            ans = Math.max(ans, sum);
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < 0) {
                    ans = Math.max(ans, sum);
                }
                sum = Math.max(sum + arr[j], arr[j]);
                ans = Math.max(ans, sum);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
