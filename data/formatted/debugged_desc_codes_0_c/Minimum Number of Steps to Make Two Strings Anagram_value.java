There is a bug in the given code. The bug is in the calculation of the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s. The formula used to calculate the minimum steps is incorrect. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the formula used to calculate the minimum number of steps. Instead of dividing `diff` by 2, we should sum the absolute differences between each letter's frequency in s and t, and then divide the result by 2.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        int sf[] = new int[26];
        int tf[] = new int[26];
        int diff = 0; // initialize diff to 0
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            sf[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            tf[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            diff += Math.abs(sf[i] - tf[i]); // sum the absolute differences
        }
        return diff / 2; // divide the sum by 2 to get the minimum steps
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, we initialize `diff` to 0 instead of 1, and then we sum the absolute differences between the frequency of each letter in `s` and `t`. Finally, we divide the sum by 2 to get the minimum number of steps required to make `t` an anagram of `s`.
