The code has a logical bug. It is supposed to check if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target, but it is currently not functioning as intended.

Step-by-step bug identification and fixing:
1. The initial if statement `if (root != null)` is flawed. It should check for `root == null` to handle the base case where the root is null, not `root != null`. We will change `if (root != null)` to `if (root == null)`.
2. The second issue is that the `set.add(root.val)` is called after the `if` statement that returns `true` if `set.contains(k - root.val)`. So even if the sum exists, adding it to the set happens after checking. We need to move `set.add(root.val)` before the `if` statement that checks for the sum.
3. The `if (root != null)` should be replaced by `if (root == null)` to handle the base case when the root is null.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

    public boolean findTarget(TreeNode root, int k) {
        if (root == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (set.contains(k - root.val)) {
            return true;
        }
        set.add(root.val);
        return findTarget(root.left, k) || findTarget(root.right, k);
    }
}
```
