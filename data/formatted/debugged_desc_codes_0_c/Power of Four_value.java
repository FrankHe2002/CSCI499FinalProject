Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses Math.log11 instead of Math.log. There is no built-in support for base 11 logarithm in Java's Math class.
2. The modulus operation (%) is used to check if the result of the logarithmic operation is a whole number, which is incorrect.

Solution:
1. Replace Math.log11() with Math.log().
2. Change the calculation to check if the result of the logarithmic operation is a whole number.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        return (Math.log(n) / Math.log(4)) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
```
