```java

        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }

        if (targetCapacity > jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity || targetCapacity < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        if (jug1Capacity == 0 || jug2Capacity == 0) {
            return targetCapacity == 0 || targetCapacity == jug1Capacity || targetCapacity == jug2Capacity;
        }
        int g = gcd(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity);

Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is related to the constraints of limit and the handling of edge cases.

Reasoning:
1. The original code does not handle the case when jug1Capacity or jug2Capacity is 0.
2. The original code does not consider the possibility of negative targetCapacity.

Fix:
1. Add a condition to check if jug1Capacity or jug2Capacity is 0, in which case the targetCapacity should also be 0, jug1Capacity, or jug2Capacity to be measurable.
2. Add a condition to check if targetCapacity is negative, in which case it should return false immediately.
3. Modify the condition to check if targetCapacity is greater than jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity instead of jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity, in order to include the case where targetCapacity is exactly equal to jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity.

The updated code handles these cases and adds the necessary conditions for the constraints to be met.
