Bug type:
Logical error in the fun() function.

Reasoning:
1. The function fun(x) is intended to check if the number x is self-dividing by iterating through its digits.
2. The y variable is incorrectly defined and used in the while loop.
3. The condition to check if the current digit is zero is also incorrect.
4. The condition to check if the number is self-dividing is also incorrect.

I will fix these issues by:
1. Modifying the while loop to correctly iterate through the digits of the number.
2. Checking if the current digit is zero and if the number is divisible by the digit.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> selfDividingNumbers(int left, int right) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (left <= right) {
            if (fun(left))
                ans.add(left);
            left++;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    boolean fun(int x) {
        int k = x;
        while (k > 0) {
            int digit = k % 10;
            if (digit == 0 || x % digit != 0)
                return false;
            k = k / 10;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
