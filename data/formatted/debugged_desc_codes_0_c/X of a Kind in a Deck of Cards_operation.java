Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
1. The code is trying to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the counts of each integer in the deck. This GCD will be used to determine if it's possible to split the deck into groups of the same size.
2. The recursive gcd() method is incorrectly calculating the GCD. It should be using the conventional method of finding the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

Fix:
1. Modify the gcd() method to use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasGroupsSizeX(int[] deck) {
        int[] count = new int[10000];
        for (int i : deck)
            count[i]++;
        int gcd = 0;
        for (int i : count) {
            if (i != 0) {
                gcd = (gcd == 0) ? i : findGCD(gcd, i);
            }
        }
        return gcd >= 2;
    }

    private int findGCD(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return findGCD(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
