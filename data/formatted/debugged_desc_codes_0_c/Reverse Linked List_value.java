Bug Type:
The code logic may have a bug where the last node of the reversed list is not properly returned.

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes `temp` and `next` outside the while loop, which could lead to incorrect results as they are not reset for each iteration.
2. The loop condition `curr != null && next != null` is based on the assumption that the length of the linked list is even.

Let's fix the identified issues:
- Move the initialization of `temp` and `next` inside the while loop.
- Change the loop condition to `next != null` to accommodate both odd and even-length linked lists.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {

        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;

        ListNode curr = head;
        ListNode prev = null, next = null;
      
        while (curr != null) {
            // Save the next node
            next = curr.next;
            // Reverse the link
            curr.next = prev;
            // Move prev and curr pointers one step forward
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }

        return prev;
    }
}
```
