The code provided attempts to solve the problem of finding all the integers that appear twice in an array. The algorithm is trying to achieve linear runtime and use constant extra space.

The code seems to use the concept of flipping the sign of an element at a specific index to identify if it has been seen before. It then adds the element to the result list if it has been seen before.

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified the bug. The issue is with the line `nums[ind] = - 2 * nums[ind];`. It should be `nums[ind] *= -1;` instead. 

This is likely due to a typo, where the developer mistakenly used `- 2 * nums[ind]` instead of `-1 * nums[ind]` to invert the sign.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int ind = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1; // Getting the index
            if (nums[ind] < 0) { // If the value at that index is negative, it means we have seen this value before
                ans.add(ind + 1); // Add the value to the result list
            } else {
                nums[ind] *= -1; // Flip the sign of the value at that index
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, I have replaced `nums[ind] = - 2 * nums[ind];` with `nums[ind] *= -1;` to correctly invert the sign as originally intended.
