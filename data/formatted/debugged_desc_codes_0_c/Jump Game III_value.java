Bug type: Logical Error

The code looks at a high level as it should work. The program uses BFS to traverse the array. The problem could be with the condition `if (curr - arr[curr] >= -1)` when subtracting `arr[curr]` from `curr`. Since the problem statement says that the integers in the array are non-negative, checking if the result is greater than or equal to -1 might not be appropriate.

To fix the bug, we just need to change the condition `if (curr - arr[curr] >= -1)` to `if (curr - arr[curr] >= 0)`.

Here's the updated code:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class Solution {
    public boolean canReach(int[] arr, int start) {
        int n = arr.length;
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[n];
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(start);
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            while (size-- > 0) {
                int curr = q.poll();
                if (vis[curr])
                    continue;
                if (arr[curr] == 0)
                    return true;
                if (curr + arr[curr] < n)
                    q.add(curr + arr[curr]);
                if (curr - arr[curr] >= 0)  // Fixed the bug here
                    q.add(curr - arr[curr]);
                vis[curr] = true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
