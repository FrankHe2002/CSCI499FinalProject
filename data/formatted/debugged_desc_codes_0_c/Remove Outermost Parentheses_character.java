The bug in this code is that it does not properly handle the outermost part of the valid parentheses string. 

1. We can start by creating a new StringBuilder to store the result.
2. We should initialize an int variable to keep track of the open parenthesis count.
3. While iterating through each character of the input string, when encountering an opening parenthesis, we can:
   - Increment the open parenthesis count
   - If the open parenthesis count is greater than 1 (indicating this is not the outermost opening parenthesis), we can append the character to the StringBuilder.
4. When encountering a closing parenthesis, we can:
   - Decrement the open parenthesis count
   - If the open parenthesis count is greater than 0 (indicating this is not the outermost closing parenthesis), we can append the character to the StringBuilder.
5. Finally, we can return the StringBuilder as the result.

Here's the revised code:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public String removeOuterParentheses(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int openParenCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);

            if (ch == '(') {
                if (openParenCount > 0) {
                    sb.append(ch);
                }
                openParenCount++;
            } else {
                openParenCount--;
                if (openParenCount > 0) {
                    sb.append(ch);
                }
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
