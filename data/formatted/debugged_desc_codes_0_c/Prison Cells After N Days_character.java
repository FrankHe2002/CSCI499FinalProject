The code calculates the state of the prison after n days using a while loop and conditions to check the state of each cell based on its adjacent neighbors.

Bugs:
1. After calculating the state of each cell, the temporary array `temp` is not copied back to `cells`. This causes the state of the cells to be updated incorrectly.

Identifying the bug:
- The code uses a while loop and calculates the state of each cell based on its adjacent neighbors, so the bug might be related to how the state of the cells is updated.
- The `temp` array is used to store the updated state of the cells, but the values are not copied back to `cells`. This leads to incorrect calculations for the subsequent iterations.

Fixing the bug:
- Replace `cells = temp.clone();` with `System.arraycopy(temp, 0, cells, 0, cells.length);` to copy the values of the `temp` array back to the `cells` array.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int n) {
        // # Since we have 6 cells moving cells (two will remain unchanged at anytime) 
        // # the cycle will restart after 14 iterations
        // # 1- The number of days if smaller than 14 -> you brute force O(13)
        // # 2- The number is bigger than 14
        // #                       - You do a first round of 14 iterations
        // #                       - Than you do a second round of n%14 iterations
        // #                       ===> O(27)

        n = n % 14 == 0 ? 14 : n % 14;
        int temp[] = new int[cells.length];

        while (n-- > 0) {
            for (int i = 1; i < cells.length - 1; i++) {
                temp[i] = cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1] ? 1 : 0;
            }
            System.arraycopy(temp, 0, cells, 0, cells.length); // copy values back to cells
        }

        return cells;
    }
}
```
