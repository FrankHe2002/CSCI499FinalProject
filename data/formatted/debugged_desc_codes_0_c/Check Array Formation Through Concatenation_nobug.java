This Java code is meant to check if it's possible to form the array `arr` by concatenating the arrays in `pieces` in any order. It achieves this by using a HashMap to map the first element of each array `pieces[i]` to the entire array `pieces[i]`. Then, it loops through the elements of `arr`, checking if each element is present in the HashMap and if the subsequent elements in the corresponding array are in the correct order.

Upon reviewing the code, the logic appears to be correct. However, there is an issue with the data type that needs to be addressed.

The issue in the code is the data type of the key in the HashMap. The key in the HashMap is an integer, but the input array `arr` contains distinct integers. The key should instead be a string to uniquely identify the array and match it with the given input array `arr`. Changing the key to a string will prevent any potential collision in the keys and will support the requirement of distinct integers.

To fix the issue, the key in the HashMap should be a string representation of the entire array. This can be achieved by using `Arrays.toString()` to transform the array into a string.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean canFormArray(int[] arr, int[][] pieces) {
        HashMap<String, int[]> hm = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] list : pieces) {
            hm.put(Arrays.toString(list), list);
        }

        int index = 0;
        while (index < arr.length) {
            if (!hm.containsKey(String.valueOf(arr[index]))) {
                return false;
            }

            int[] list = hm.get(String.valueOf(arr[index]));
            for (int val : list) {
                if (index >= arr.length || val != arr[index]) {
                    return false;
                }
                index++;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
