Bug: The `getNeighbors` method is not accurately checking whether the box can be pushed. It only checks if the next cell, after pushing the box, is not a wall instead of ensuring that it is an empty cell.

Fix:
We need to separate the logic for checking if the next cell after pushing the box is not a wall and also an empty cell. If it is not an empty cell, we should not add it to the list of neighboring states.

```java
private List<State> getNeighbors(State state) {

    int personRow = state.personRow;
    int personCol = state.personCol;
    int boxRow = state.boxRow;
    int boxCol = state.boxCol;

    List<State> states = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] dir : DIRS) {
        int rowMove = dir[0];
        int colMove = dir[1];
        int personRowNew = personRow + rowMove;
        int personColNew = personCol + colMove;
        // Shopkeeper cannot move into wall or go out of bounds skip to next direction
        if (!inBounds(personRowNew, personColNew) || isWall(personRowNew, personColNew)) {
            continue;
        }
        // Whether or not person will collide with box
        boolean willPushBox = personRowNew == boxRow && personColNew == boxCol;

        if (willPushBox) {
            int boxRowNew = boxRow + rowMove;
            int boxColNew = boxCol + colMove;
            // Ensure the next cell after pushing the box is not only not a wall, but also an empty cell
            if (inBounds(boxRowNew, boxColNew) && !isWall(boxRowNew, boxColNew) && grid[boxRowNew][boxColNew] == '.') {
                states.add(new State(personRowNew, personColNew, boxRowNew, boxColNew, state.boxPushes + 1));
            }
        } else {
            //Shop keeper moved, but not box
            states.add(new State(personRowNew, personColNew, boxRow, boxCol, state.boxPushes));
        }
    }
    return states;
}
```
