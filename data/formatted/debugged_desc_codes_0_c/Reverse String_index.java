The identified bug in the provided Java code is in the while loop where the temp variable is being assigned s[end + 2] instead of s[end]. This will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because s[end + 2] is out-of-bounds.

To fix this bug:
1. Change the assignment of temp to s[end] instead of s[end + 2].
2. Swap the positions of s[end] and s[start] in the second line of the while loop to correctly reverse the string.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.91%) | Memory: 54.3 MB (Top 74.13%)
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int start = 0, end = s.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            char temp = s[end];
            s[end] = s[start];
            s[start] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }

    }
}
```
