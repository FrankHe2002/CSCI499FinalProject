Bug type: Logical Error

The code seems to be using backtracking to find the minimum possible maximum working time of any assignment. However, it has a logical error because the implementation is not correctly distributing the jobs among the workers. 

Here's the fix for the logical error:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    public int minimumTimeRequired(int[] jobs, int k) {
        int length = jobs.length;
        Arrays.sort(jobs);
        backtrack(jobs, length - 1, new int[k]);
        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int[] jobs, int current, int[] workers) {
        if (current < 0) {
            result = Math.min(result, Arrays.stream(workers).max().getAsInt());
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < workers.length; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && workers[i] == workers[i - 1]) {
                continue;
            }
            // make choice
            workers[i] += jobs[current];
            // backtrack
            backtrack(jobs, current - 1, workers);
            // undo the choice
            workers[i] -= jobs[current];
        }
    }
}
```

In the original code, there was a typo in the backtrack method call `length - -1`. It should be `length - 1` to correctly index the last job. Additionally, the condition `if (Arrays.stream(workers).max().getAsInt() >= result)` is not necessary and can be omitted.

The fix involved correcting the index in the `backtrack` method call and removing the unnecessary condition inside the `backtrack` method. With these changes, the logical error should be fixed.
