The code is trying to find the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than the given array, that can be made with exactly one swap. It loops through the array, finds the first decreasing sequence and then swaps the minimum element with the rightmost element less than it. 

Here is the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] prevPermOpt1(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int prev = arr[n - 1];
        int ind = -1;
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (arr[i] > prev) {
                prev = arr[i];
            } else {
                // find the index of the minimum element to the right of arr[i] that is less than arr[i]
                int minIndex = -1;
                int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    if (arr[j] < arr[i] && arr[j] < min) {
                        min = arr[j];
                        minIndex = j;
                    }
                }
                if (minIndex != -1) {
                    int temp = arr[minIndex];
                    arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = temp;
                    return arr;
                }
                // if there is no such swap that makes the permutation smaller, return the array as is
                break;
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```

Bug Fixes:
1. Renamed the variable `indte` to `minIndex` for clarity.
2. Added a condition to check if `minIndex` is not equal to -1, indicating that a valid swap was found. If found, perform the swap and return the array immediately. If no swap is found, break from the loop and return the array as is.
