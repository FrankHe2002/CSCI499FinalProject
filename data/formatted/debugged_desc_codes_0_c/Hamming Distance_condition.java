The bug in the code lies in the while loop condition. The condition `while (ans <= 0)` should be `while (ans > 0)` to correctly calculate the Hamming distance. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int ans = x ^ y;
        int count = 0;
        while (ans > 0) {
            count += ans & 1;
            ans >>= 1;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
