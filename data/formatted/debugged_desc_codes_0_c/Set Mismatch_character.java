The bug in the code is that the closing curly brace for the outer for loop is placed before the check for the count of the duplicated and missing numbers. This causes the return statement to be executed after just one iteration of the outer loop and does not allow the inner loop to count the occurrences of each number in the array.

To fix the bug, the closing curly brace for the outer for loop should be placed after the check for the count of the duplicated and missing numbers.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int dup = 0, miss = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == i) count++;
            }
            if (count == 2) dup = i;
            if (count == 0) miss = i;
        }

        return new int[] {dup, miss};
    }
}

// TC: O(n ^ 2), SC: O(1)
```
