The code seems to be correct and does not have any apparent bugs. The logic is using the Union Find algorithm to determine if the given set of equations is solvable or not.

The algorithm begins by initializing an array of integers called par to represent the parent of each variable. It then iterates through the equations, performing merging operations for "=" equations. After that, it traverses the entire string to search for any "!=" operations and checks if their parents are the same.

Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, I don't currently see any bugs in the code.

The only modification I would recommend is related to variable scoping. The par variable could be changed to non-static, and the findPar method could also be changed to non-static.

Here's the modified code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 98.0%) | Memory: 40.98 MB (Top 47.4%)

class Solution {
    int[] par;

    public int findPar(int u) {
        return par[u] == u ? u : (par[u] = findPar(par[u]));
    }

    public boolean equationsPossible(String[] equations) {
        par = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            par[i] = i;
        }

        /*First perform all the merging operation*/
        for (String s : equations) {
            int c1 = s.charAt(0) - 'a';
            int c2 = s.charAt(3) - 'a';
            char sign = s.charAt(1);

            int p1 = findPar(c1);
            int p2 = findPar(c2);

            if (sign == '=') {
                if (p1 != p2) {
                    if (p1 >= p2) {
                        par[p2] = p1;
                    } else {
                        par[p1] = p2;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        /*Now traverse on the whole string and search for any != operation and check if there parents are same*/
        for (String s : equations) {
            int c1 = s.charAt(0) - 'a';
            int c2 = s.charAt(3) - 'a';
            char sign = s.charAt(1);

            int p1 = findPar(c1);
            int p2 = findPar(c2);

            if (sign == '!') {
                if (p1 == p2) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
