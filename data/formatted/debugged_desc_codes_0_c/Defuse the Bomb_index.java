The bug in the provided code is that the initial window sum is being calculated incorrectly. 

When `k < 0`, the starting and ending points for calculating the initial window sum are being set incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the start and end points for calculating the initial window sum when `k < 0`. We also need to calculate the initial sum based on the updated start and end points.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] decrypt(int[] code, int k) {
        int[] res = new int[code.length];
        if (k == 0) return res;
        
        int[] newArr = new int[code.length * 2]; // Create a new array to handle circular behavior
        for (int i = 0; i < code.length; i++) {
            newArr[i] = code[i];
            newArr[i + code.length] = code[i];
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < code.length; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            if (k > 0) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j <= i + k; j++) {
                    sum += newArr[j];
                }
            } else if (k < 0) {
                for (int j = i - 1; j >= i + k; j--) {
                    sum += newArr[j];
                }
            }
            res[i] = sum;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, we created a new array to handle the circular behavior and then calculated the initial sum for each element in the `code` array based on the value of `k`. This fixed the bug where the initial window sum was being calculated incorrectly.
