Bug Type:
The bug here is a logical error, specifically in the condition checks within the for loop. It seems that the condition `if (n1 > p1 && n2 > p2)` should be nested within the `else` block. This issue will cause incorrect counting of required operations.

Solution:
1. Move the nested condition `if (n1 > p2 && n2 > p2)` inside the `else` block, since it is the condition to check when `n1` and `n2` are not strictly increasing with respect to `p1` and `p2`.
2. Adjust the variable assignments inside the `else` block based on the correct sequence in accordance with the prompt.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwap(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int p1 = nums1[0], p2 = nums2[0], ans = 0;
        int len = nums1.length, s = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            int n1 = nums1[i], n2 = nums2[i];
            if (n1 > p1 && n2 > p2) {
                p1 = n1;
                p2 = n2;
            } else {
                if (n1 > p2 && n2 > p1) {
                    ans += Math.min(count, i - s - count);
                    s = i;
                    count = 0;
                }
                int temp = p1;  // store the value of p1
                p1 = n2;        // update p1 and p2 with n2 and n1 respectively
                p2 = temp;      // update p2 with the stored value
                count++;
            }
        }
        return ans + Math.min(count, len - s - count);
    }
}
```
