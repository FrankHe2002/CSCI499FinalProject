The code appears to be calculating the sum of the widths of all non-empty subsequences of the array `nums`. It does this by sorting the array and then iterates through the sorted array to calculate the sum.

Potential bug:
The modulus operation in the line `ans = (ans + p * nums[i] - p * nums[nums.length - 1 - i]) % MOD;` could produce negative results if `p * nums[nums.length - 1 - i]` is greater than `p * nums[i]`, which could result in an incorrect answer.

Fix:
To fix the potential bug, the result of `p * nums[nums.length - 1 - i]` should be subtracted from `p * nums[i]`, and then the modulus operation should be applied.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumSubseqWidths(int[] nums) {
        int MOD = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        long ans = 0;
        long p = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            ans = (ans + (p * nums[i] - p * nums[nums.length - 1 - i] + MOD) % MOD) % MOD;
            p = (p * 2) % MOD;
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```
In the fixed code, I added `(MOD + ...)` to ensure that the result of the subtraction is non-negative before applying the modulus operation. This should prevent any potential issues with negative results that may have caused incorrect outputs.
