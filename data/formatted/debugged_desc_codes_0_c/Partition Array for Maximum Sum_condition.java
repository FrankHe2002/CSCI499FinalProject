Bugs/Issues:
1. The `memo` HashMap is not being used correctly.
2. The `findMaxSumWithKEle` method is failing to calculate the maximum sum with k elements.

Step by Step Thinking:
1. The `memo` HashMap is meant to store the subarray sums for reuse, rather than recalculate them for each iteration.
2. The `findMaxSumWithKEle` method needs to be fixed to correctly calculate the maximum sum with k elements.
3. The code above is also verbose and can be simplified.

Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSumAfterPartitioning(int[] arr, int k) {
        return maxSum(arr, k, 0, new Integer[arr.length + 1]);
    }

    public int maxSum(int[] arr, int k, int start, Integer[] memo) {
        if (start >= arr.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (memo[start] != null) {
            return memo[start];
        }
        int maxVal = 0;
        int maxSum = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= k && start + i <= arr.length; i++) {
            maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, arr[start + i - 1]);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, maxVal * i + maxSum(arr, k, start + i, memo));
        }
        memo[start] = maxSum;
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

The changes made include the following:
- Changed the `maxSum` method to accept an additional `memo` parameter, an array of Integers for memoization.
- Added base cases to terminate the recursion when we reach the end of the array.
- Implemented memoization to store and reuse calculated subarray sums.
- Simplified the logic for calculating the maximum sum with k elements.
