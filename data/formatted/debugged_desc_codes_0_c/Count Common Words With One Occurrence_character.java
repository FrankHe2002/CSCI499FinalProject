Bug type: Syntax error

Reasoning:
1. The code is intended to count the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays words1 and words2.
2. The initial review of the code reveals a syntax error in the for loop where the map1 is being populated.
3. The error is due to a missing closing parenthesis ")" after the value in the put method inside the for loop for words1.

I will fix the syntax error by adding the missing closing parenthesis ")" in the put method inside the for loop for words1.

Here's the modified code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int countWords(String[] words1, String[] words2) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<String, Integer> map2 = new HashMap<>();

        for (String word : words1)
            map1.put(word, map1.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        for (String word : words2)
            map2.put(word, map2.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);

        int count = 0;
        for (String word : words1)
            if (map1.get(word) == 1 && map2.getOrDefault(word, 0) == 1)
                count++;
      
        return count;
    }
}
```
