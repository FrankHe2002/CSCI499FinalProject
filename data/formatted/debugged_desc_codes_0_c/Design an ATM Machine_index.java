The code initializes the `notes` array of type `long` instead of `int` to avoid errors in large test cases. The `deposit` method adds the deposited banknotes to the `notes` array. The `withdraw` method attempts to find the optimal combination of banknotes to fulfill the withdraw request and updates the `notes` array accordingly.

Bug:
The bug in the code is in the `deposit` method. The index used to access the `notes` array should start from 0, not 1. The current code will deposit banknotes into the wrong array indices, causing incorrect counts when withdrawing.

Fix:
1. Change `notes[i + 1]` to `notes[i]` in the `deposit` method to properly deposit the banknotes.
2. Since banknotes are of type `int`, the `notes` array should also be of type `int`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class ATM {
    int[] notes = new int[5];                                                
    int[] denoms;

    public ATM() {
        denoms = new int[] {20, 50, 100, 200, 500};                               
    }

    public void deposit(int[] banknotesCount) {
        for (int i = 0; i < banknotesCount.length; i++) {
            notes[i] += banknotesCount[i];                                       
        }
    }

    public int[] withdraw(int amount) {
        int[] result = new int[5];                                              
        for (int i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (amount >= denoms[i]) {
                int quantity = Math.min(notes[i], amount / denoms[i]);     
                amount -= denoms[i] * quantity;                                
                result[i] = quantity;
            }
        }
        if (amount != 0) {
            return new int[] {-1};
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            notes[i] -= result[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
