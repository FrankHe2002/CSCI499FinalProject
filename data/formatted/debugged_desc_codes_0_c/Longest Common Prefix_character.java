The syntax error in the code is preventing the code from compiling.

The error is on line 25:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < str.length() i++) {
```

The error lies in the loop definition in the `insertIntoTrie` method, there is a missing semicolon after `str.length()`.

To fix this error, add the missing semicolon to the for loop definition.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
```
