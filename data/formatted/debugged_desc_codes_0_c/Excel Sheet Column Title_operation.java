The bug in the code is with the calculation of the column title. The current code has a bug in the line:
```java
ans = String.valueOf((char) ('A' + (int) ((26 + (long) columnNumber) % 26))) + ans;
```
The bug is caused by using the modulus operator and adding 26 to the columnNumber. This logic does not work for column numbers that are multiples of 26.

Here's the fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int columnNumber) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        while (columnNumber > 0) {
            columnNumber--;
            result.insert(0, (char) ('A' + columnNumber % 26));
            columnNumber /= 26;
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```
