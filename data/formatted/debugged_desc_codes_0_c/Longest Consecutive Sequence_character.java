The bug in the given Java code is a syntax error in the while loop inside the second for loop. The code `storage.remove(inc;` should be `storage.remove(inc);`.

Here's how the bug is identified and fixed:

1. The code is reviewed to understand its purpose, which is to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array of integers.

2. The code uses a HashSet to store the elements of the input array and then iterates through the elements to find the longest consecutive sequence.

3. While reviewing the second for loop, it's noticed that there is a syntax error in the while loop inside the loop body. The expression `storage.remove(inc;` should end with `)` instead of `;`.

4. To fix the bug, the expression `storage.remove(inc;` is changed to `storage.remove(inc);`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> storage = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            storage.add(nums[i]);
        }

        int maxL = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

            if (storage.contains(nums[i])) {
                storage.remove(nums[i]);

                int dec = nums[i] - 1;
                int inc = nums[i] + 1;
                int tempL = 1;

                while (storage.contains(dec)) {
                    storage.remove(dec);
                    dec--;
                    tempL++;
                }

                while (storage.contains(inc)) {
                    storage.remove(inc);
                    inc++;
                    tempL++;
                }

                maxL = Math.max(maxL, tempL);

            }
        }

        return maxL;
    }
}
```
