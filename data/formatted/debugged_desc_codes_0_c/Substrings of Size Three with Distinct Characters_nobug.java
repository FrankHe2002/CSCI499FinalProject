The code aims to count the number of good substrings of length three in the given string 's'. The bug in the code is that the condition for checking if a substring is good is incorrect.

To identify the bug type, let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The for loop iterates through the string starting from index 2, as the length of the substring is 3.

2. Inside the loop, it checks if the characters at index i, i-1, and i-2 are all different. If they are different, it counts the substring as good and increments the result variable 'res'.

However, this logic is incorrect because the code only checks for the first instance of a good substring and doesn't consider multiple occurrences of the same good substring.

To fix the bug, the condition for counting the good substring should be updated to consider all occurrences of the same substring.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countGoodSubstrings(String s) {
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 1) && s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 2) && s.charAt(i - 1) != s.charAt(i - 2))
                res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The fix is to increment the result 'res' for every occurrence of a good substring. With this fix, the code will correctly count all occurrences of good substrings of length three in the given string 's'.
