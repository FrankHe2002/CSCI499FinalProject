Bug type: Logical Error

The code is intended to patch the array nums with elements to ensure that any number in the range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. However, there is a logical error in the while loop inside the for loop. The condition `while (sum + 1 < x && sum < n)` does not seem to be correctly handling the patching of elements.

The while loop inside the for loop should be checking if the current sum plus 1 less than the next number in the array, x. If it is, the code should then add the value `sum + 1` to the array and update the sum. If the current sum is already greater than or equal to x, the loop should break and move on to the next number in the array.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        long sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int idx = 0;
        while (sum < n) {
            if (idx < nums.length && nums[idx] <= sum + 1) {
                sum += nums[idx++];
            } else {
                sum += sum + 1;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

I have replaced the for loop with a while loop that iterates until the sum is greater than or equal to n. Inside the while loop, I check if the current number is less than or equal to sum + 1. If it is, I add the number to the sum and increment the index. If not, I add sum + 1 to the array and increment count. This ensures that any number in the range [1, n] can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.
