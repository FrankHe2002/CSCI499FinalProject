There seems to be a bug in the given Java code. The code is expected to return a circular permutation of the given size 'n' starting from 'start'. However, the bug seems to be in the second while loop where it is attempting to populate the list 'l' with the circular permutation.

The bug type in this code is a logical error.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the second while loop. The current implementation of the second while loop is flawed because it only adds elements to the list 'l' from the starting index 'start' to the end, and then it starts from index 0 again and continues until it reaches the starting index 'start'. This results in incorrect behavior and leads to an incorrect circular permutation.

Here is the corrected code to fix the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
        List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        int len = (int) Math.pow(2, n);
        int[] arr = new int[len];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            arr[i] = (i) ^ (i / 2);
        }

        int startIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == start) {
                startIndex = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        for (int i = startIndex; i < arr.length; i++) {
            l.add(arr[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < startIndex; i++) {
            l.add(arr[i]);
        }

        return l;
    }
}

```

The fix involves changing the second while loop to two separate for loops. The first for loop adds elements to the list 'l' from the starting index 'start' to the end, and the second for loop adds elements from index 0 to the starting index 'start'. This ensures that we get the correct circular permutation starting from the specified index.
