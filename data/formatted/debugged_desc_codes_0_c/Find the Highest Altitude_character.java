The bug in the code seems to be a simple typo in the line `curr_alt += gaini];`. It should be `curr_alt += gain[i];`.

To fix this bug, we need to replace the incorrect line with the correct one.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 39.7 MB (Top 97.89%)
class Solution {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        int max_alt = 0;
        int curr_alt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gain.length; i++) {
            curr_alt += gain[i];
            max_alt = Math.max(curr_alt, max_alt);
        }
        return max_alt;
    }
}

//TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
```
