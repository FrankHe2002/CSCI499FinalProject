Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is intended to find the length of the shortest subarray to remove in order to make the remaining elements non-decreasing.
2. The first loop is used to find the first index where the array is decreasing, and the second loop is used to find the last index where the array is decreasing.
3. After finding these indices, the code calculates the minimum length of the subarray to remove in order to make the array non-decreasing.
4. However, there is a logical error in the final loop where the calculation of the minimum length is incorrect.

Fix:
- Modify the last loop to correctly calculate the minimum length by considering the maximum possible subarray length to remove.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfShortestSubarray(int[] arr) {
        int firstLast = 0, lastFirst = arr.length - 1;
        for (; firstLast < arr.length - 1; firstLast++) {
            if (arr[firstLast] > arr[firstLast + 1]) break;
        }
        //Base case for a non-decreasing sequence
        if (firstLast == arr.length - 1) return 0;
        for (; lastFirst > 0; lastFirst--) {
            if (arr[0] < arr[lastFirst - 1]) break;
        }
        //Possibilities 1 or 2 as mentioned above
        int minLength = Math.min(arr.length - firstLast - 1, lastFirst);
        for (int i = lastFirst; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (i == arr.length - 1 || arr[i + 1] < arr[i - 1]) {
                int subarrayLength = i - firstLast;
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, subarrayLength);
            }
        }
        return minLength;
    }
}
```
