The code seems to aim at finding the minimum number of steps to make strings s and t anagrams of each other. The given approach looks correct at first glance. Upon analyzing the code further, it seems that the logic for counting the number of steps is not correct.

One potential bug is that the code is only considering the count of characters in string s and t, but it's not checking for the characters that are present in one string but not in the other.

To fix this bug, we should count the characters that are present in one string but not in the other. This can be achieved by considering the absolute value of the difference between the counts of characters in both strings.

Here's the modified code with the bug fixed:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> hmap = new HashMap<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray())
            hmap.put(ch, hmap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        for (char ch : t.toCharArray())
            hmap.put(ch, hmap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) - 1);
        
        int count = 0;
        for (char key : hmap.keySet()) {
            count += Math.abs(hmap.get(key));  // Fix: Absolute value of the difference
        }

        return count / 2;  // As each step appends a character to either s or t, we only need half the count
    }
}
```

The main changes made to the code are:
1. In the final loop, we use `Math.abs(hmap.get(key))` to get the absolute difference in counts of each character in the two strings.
2. In the return statement, we divide the count by 2 as each step appends a character to either s or t, so we only need half the count for each string.

By making these changes, the code now correctly computes the minimum number of steps to make strings s and t anagrams of each other.
