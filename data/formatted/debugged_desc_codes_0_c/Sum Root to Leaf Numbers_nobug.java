The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The issue is with the calculation of the sum when a leaf node is reached. The code multiplies the current sum by 10 and adds the value of the current node, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating the sum when a leaf node is reached needs to be adjusted. The correct calculation should involve adding the value of the current node to the sum directly, without multiplying it by 10.

Here's the revised code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    int res;

    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        res = 0;
        getSum(root, 0);

        return res;
    }

    public void getSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if (root != null) {
            sum = sum * 10 + root.val;
            if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
                res += sum;
            }
            getSum(root.left, sum);
            getSum(root.right, sum);
        }
    }
}
```

The fix involves updating the `getSum` method to calculate the new sum by multiplying the current sum by 10 and adding the value of the current node. Then, when a leaf node is reached, the value of the current sum is directly added to the result without any further multiplication.

This fix ensures that the correct sum is calculated for each root-to-leaf path in the binary tree.
