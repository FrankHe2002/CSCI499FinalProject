The bug in the code is that the sentence is not being reconstructed correctly. The issue lies in how the words are being sorted and joined back together. The bug is in the line `res[st.charAt(st.length() - 1) - '1'] = st.substring(0, st.length() - 1);` where the index for the words is being calculated.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the index calculation, sort the words correctly, and then join them back into a sentence.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 59.85%) | Memory: 42 MB (Top 63.26%)
class Solution {
    public String sortSentence(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        String[] res = new String[words.length];
        for (String st : words) {
            int index = Integer.parseInt(st.substring(st.length() - 1)) - 1;
            res[index] = st.substring(0, st.length() - 1);
        }
        return String.join(" ", res);
    }
}
```
