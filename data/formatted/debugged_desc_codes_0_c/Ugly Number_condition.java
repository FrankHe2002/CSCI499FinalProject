The bug in the code is in the while condition. The condition should compare if `n` is not equal to 1, in its current form, the loop will not execute if `n` is not equal to 1, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Here's the revised code with the bug fix:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 68.17%) | Memory: 41.1 MB (Top 69.67%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false; //edge case
        while (n % 2 == 0) {
            n = n / 2;
        }
        while (n % 3 == 0) {
            n = n / 3;
        }
        while (n % 5 == 0) {
            n = n / 5;
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
}
```
