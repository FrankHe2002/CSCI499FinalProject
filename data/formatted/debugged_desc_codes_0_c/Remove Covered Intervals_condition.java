The given Java code is trying to find the number of intervals that are not covered by any other intervals in the list. The code seems to be logically correct, but there might be a bug related to the comparison logic used to check if an interval is covered by another interval.

Upon reviewing the code, the logic inside the for loop seems to be incorrect. The conditions `c <= a` and `b >= d` are used to check if an interval is covered by another interval, which seems to be incorrect. The correct condition should be `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

To fix the bug, the condition inside the for loop should be modified to check if `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int removeCoveredIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals == null || intervals.length == 0) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (i1, i2) -> (i1[0] == i2[0] ? i2[1] - i1[1] : i1[0] - i2[0]));
        int c = intervals[0][0], d = intervals[0][1];
        int ans = intervals.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int a = intervals[i][0], b = intervals[i][1];
            if (c <= a && b <= d) ans--;
            else {
                c = a;
                d = b;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
