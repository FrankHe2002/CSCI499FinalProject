Bug type: Logical error

1. In the first for loop, the elements of the nums array are pushed onto the stack backwards, i.e., in reverse order.
2. In the second for loop, the comparison and logic to find the next greater element are incorrect.

To fix the issue:
- Revisit the logic to find the next greater element in a circular array.
- Use modulo operations to handle the circular nature of the array.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(result, -1);
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            int num = nums[i % n];
            while (!s.isEmpty() && nums[s.peek()] < num) {
                result[s.pop()] = num;
            }
            if (i < n) {
                s.push(i);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

What's changed:
1. Added a separate result array to store the next greater elements.
2. Used a single loop iterating over 2 * n elements to cover the circular nature of the array.
3. Modified the logic inside the loop to find the next greater element and store it in the result array.
4. Removed unnecessary second for loop and stack operations.

This fixes the logical error and returns the correct next greater number for every element in the circular array.
