The bug in the given code is in the `insert` method where it is trying to insert a new node into the binary search tree.

The bug type is related to the improper insertion logic that leads to an incorrect binary search tree structure.

To fix the bug, the insertion logic has to be fixed by properly handling the insertion of nodes based on whether the value is greater than or less than the current node, and checking and inserting on the left or right subtree accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
public class Codec {

    // ... (other methods remain the same)

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        if (data.isEmpty()) return null;

        String[] dataArr = data.split(",");
        TreeNode root = null;

        for (String node : dataArr) {
            root = insert(Integer.parseInt(node), root);
        }

        return root;
    }

    private TreeNode insert(int digit, TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new TreeNode(digit);
        }

        if (digit > root.val) {
            root.right = insert(digit, root.right);
        } else {
            root.left = insert(digit, root.left);
        }

        return root;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code:
- In the `deserialize` method, a new `TreeNode root` is initially set to `null`, and then for each value in the `dataArr`, the `insert` method is called, and the new root is updated with the return value to ensure that the newly inserted nodes maintain the binary search tree structure.
- In the `insert` method, for each value, a new node is recursively inserted into the binary search tree based on whether the value is greater than or less than the current node, and returns the new root after insertion.

These changes significantly improve the insertion logic and fix the bug related to the incorrect binary search tree structure.
