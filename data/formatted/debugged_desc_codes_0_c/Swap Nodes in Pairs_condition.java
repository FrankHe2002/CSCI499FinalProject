Potential Bug:
1. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be `curr != null && curr.next != null` instead of `curr == null && curr.next != null`.

Solution:
Correct the condition in the while loop and also adjust the variable assignment to ensure that the ListNode connections are properly swapped.

Updated Code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.8 MB (Top 55.04%)

class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0), prev = dummy, curr = head;
        dummy.next = head;
        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            prev.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
            prev.next.next = curr;
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
            prev.next.next = curr;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
