Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is supposed to find the integers present in each array of nums, but it has an error in the logic used to count the occurrence of each number.
2. In the second for loop, where the count of each number is being incremented, there is an issue. `count[ans]` should be `count[i]` to represent the occurrence count of the current number `i`.

Fix:
I will update `count[ans]` to `count[i]` in the second for loop.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> intersection(int[][] nums) {

        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        int[] count = new int[1001];

        for (int[] arr : nums) {
            for (int i : arr) {
                count[i]++;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {
            if (count[i] == nums.length) {
                ans.add(i);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
