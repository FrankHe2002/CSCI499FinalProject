The code appears to have a bug that is preventing it from functioning as expected. Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the bug might be related to the logic used to calculate the number of valid words for each puzzle.

The logic for identifying the bug is as follows:
1. The code iterates through the input words and creates a bitmask for each word, where each bit in the bitmask represents the presence of a character in the word.
2. The code then iterates through the input puzzles and attempts to calculate the number of valid words that can be formed from each puzzle.
3. However, the logic inside the while loop for finding valid words seems to have an issue where the value of 'c' is being calculated incorrectly and also using the modulus operator inappropriately which may lead to unexpected results.

To fix this bug, the 'c' variable should be incremented by 1 for each valid substring instead of using the modulus operator. Additionally, the code for finding the next substring can be simplified by removing the unneeded checks and directly calculating the next substring without using bitwise operations.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {

    public List<Integer> findNumOfValidWords(String[] words, String[] puzzles) {

        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String w : words) {
            int mask = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
                mask |= 1 << (w.charAt(i) - 'a');
            }
            map.put(mask, map.getOrDefault(mask, 0) + 1);
        }

        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

        for (String p : puzzles) {
            int mask = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < p.length(); i++) {
                mask |= 1 << (p.charAt(i) - 'a');
            }
            int c = 0;
            int sub = mask;
            int first = 1 << (p.charAt(0) - 'a');
            while (sub > 0) {
                if ((sub & first) == first && map.containsKey(sub)) {
                    c += map.get(sub);
                }
                sub = (sub - 1) & mask; // get the next substring
            }

            res.add(c);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by updating the logic inside the while loop to correctly calculate the number of valid words for each puzzle and the way next substring is calculated. Now, the code should function as expected and provide the correct result.
