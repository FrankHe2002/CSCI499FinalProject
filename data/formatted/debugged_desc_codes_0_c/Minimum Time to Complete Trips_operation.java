Bug Type: Compilation Error

Reasoning:
1. The variable "anstillnow" is initialized with the value of "%" which is not a valid syntax in Java.
2. Additionally, the code is trying to use the modulo operator, but it seems like it may be a typo for initializing a variable.

The fix will involve:
1. Initializing the variable "anstillnow" with a valid value.
2. Removing the erroneous initialization with the modulo operator "%".

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumTime(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        long anstillnow = Long.MAX_VALUE; // Initialize with a large value
        // the rest of the code remains the same
    }
}
```
