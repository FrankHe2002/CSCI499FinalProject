Bug type: Logic error

The given code is erroneous. It uses a logic to find and replace "00" by "10", and "10" by "01", but it does not handle all the cases correctly and efficiently. It just finds the first 0 and continues to append '1' and '1' till that 0 which might not give maximum result for some cases.

To fix the bug:

1. Traverse the binary string and count the zeros.
2. If the count of zeros is less than 2, return the original string as it's already the maximum binary string.
3. Otherwise, if there's only one zero, replace all the ones with zeros, and append the 1s after the zero.
4. Otherwise, replace the first zero with 1, and append the count-1 ones after that zero.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String maximumBinaryString(String binary) {
        int n = binary.length();
        int onesCount = 0;
        int firstZeroIndex = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (binary.charAt(i) == '1') {
                onesCount += (firstZeroIndex == -1) ? 1 : 0;
            } else if (firstZeroIndex == -1) {
                firstZeroIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        if (firstZeroIndex == -1 || onesCount < 2) { // For strings with one or no zero, return the original string
            return binary;
        }
        
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder("1".repeat(n - onesCount)); // Replace the first zero with a 1
        ans.setCharAt(firstZeroIndex + onesCount - 1, '0');
        
        return ans.toString();
    }
}
```
