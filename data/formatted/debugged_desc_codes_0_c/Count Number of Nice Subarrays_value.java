The code appears to be using a two pointer + sliding window technique to count the number of nice subarrays. The code's approach is to fix `i` and move `j` until the count of odd numbers is equal to `k`. Then, it counts every possible subarray by reducing the size of the subarray from `i`. It uses a `temp` variable to count all the possible subarrays from between `i` and `j`.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems to be using an incorrect approach to count the number of nice subarrays. Specifically, the logic for the `temp` variable might be incorrect. The explanation provided in comments suggests that `temp` should be set to 0 when encountering a new window formed by odd elements. However, this approach may have a logic error as it only resets `temp` when encountering new odd elements, and then adds it to `result` even when there are no new odd elements.

Below is the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubarrays(int[] nums, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int odd = 0;
        int result = 0;
        int temp = 0;

        while (j < nums.length) {
            if (nums[j] % 2 != 0) {
                odd++;
                temp = 0; // whenever a new odd element is encountered, reset temp to 0
            }

            while (odd == k) {
                temp++;
                if (nums[i] % 2 != 0) {
                    odd--;
                }
                i++;
            }

            result += temp;

            j++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

The fix was to reset `temp` to 0 when a new odd element is encountered. After this fix, the logic should properly count the number of nice subarrays.
