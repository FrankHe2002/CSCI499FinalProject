Bug type: Logical error

The issue with the given code is that it does not correctly calculate the sum of the chosen elements from each row of the matrix and compare it to the target to find the minimum absolute difference. The code uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of elements from each row, which leads to multiple calculations for the same values and results in incorrect output.

To fix the logical error, a dynamic programming approach can be used to iterate through the matrix and calculate the sum of the elements for each row, storing the minimum absolute differences in the dp array. After populating the dp array, the minimum absolute difference can be found at the last row of the dp array.

Here's the updated code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizeTheDifference(int[][] mat, int target) {
        int m = mat.length;
        int n = mat[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][4901]; 

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[0][mat[0][i]] = 1;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 4901; j++) {
                if (dp[i-1][j] != 0) {
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                        int sum = j + mat[i][k];
                        if (sum <= 4900) {
                            dp[i][sum] = 1;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int minDiff = 4900;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4901; i++) {
            if (dp[m-1][i] != 0) {
                minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(target - i));
            }
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
}
```
