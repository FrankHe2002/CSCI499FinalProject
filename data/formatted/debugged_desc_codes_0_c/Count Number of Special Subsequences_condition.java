The code uses a counting technique to count the number of special subsequences in the given array, and in the process, it calculates the count of subsequences that start and end with 0, start with 0 and end with 1, and start with 0 and end with 2.

The buggy part of the code is the incorrect condition check.
When the code checks for `else if (i == 1)`, it is not correct because the edge case where `i == 2` will be skipped due to the incorrect condition.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition check in the for loop to handle the cases when `i == 1` and `i == 2` separately.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSpecialSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        long z = 0; //starting and ending with zero
        long zo = 0; //starting with zero and ending with One
        long zot = 0;//starting with zero and ending Two
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i == 0) {
                z = ((2 * z) % mod + 1) % mod; //zero = 2*zero+1
            } else if (i == 1) {
                zo = ((2 * zo) % mod + z % mod) % mod; //zeroOne = 2*zeroOne+zero
            } else {
                zot = ((2 * zot) % mod + zo % mod) % mod; //zeroOneTwo = 2*zeroOneTwo+zeroOne
            }
        }
        return (int) (zot % mod);
    }
}
```

This condition in the for loop helps to accurately calculate the different subsequences that are special.
