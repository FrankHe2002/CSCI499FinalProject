The code provided appears to be trying to solve the problem of finding the length of the longest mountain subarray. However, after reviewing the code step by step, I found multiple issues. Below are the identified bugs with the reasoning process:

1. The array index out of bound issue in the right method:
    - In the `right` method, there is a typo mistake in the while condition. The code should be `arr[j - 1] > arr[j]` instead of `arr[j * 1] > arr[j]`.
    - The code is trying to compare `arr[j * 1]` where `j * 1` will always be the same as `j`, but it causes an index out of bound error. The correct comparison should be between `arr[j - 1]` and `arr[j]`.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
public int right(int[] arr, int i) {
        int j = i + 1;
        while (j < arr.length && arr[j - 1] > arr[j])
            j++;
        return j - (i + 1);
}
```

By fixing this bug in the `right` method, the code should work as expected to find the length of the longest mountain subarray.
