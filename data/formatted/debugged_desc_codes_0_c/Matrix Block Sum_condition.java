The bug in the given Java code is in the nested for loops that are meant to calculate the sum of elements in the given range around mat[i][j].

The following issues are identified in the given code:
1. The condition `y > n` in the inner for loop is incorrect. It should be `y < n` to ensure the loop stays within the column bounds.
2. The boundary conditions for the inner for loop are not correct.

The following fixes apply:
1. Change `for (int y = q; y <= j + k && y > n; y++)` to `for (int y = q; y <= j + k && y < n; y++)` to fix the condition for the inner loop.
2. Change the condition in for loops to correctly check against the bounds of the matrix to avoid going out of bounds.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixBlockSum(int[][] mat, int k) {
        int m = mat.length, n = mat[0].length;
        int[][] answer = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int val = 0;
                int p = Math.max(0, i - k);
                int q = Math.max(0, j - k);
                for (int x = p; x <= Math.min(m - 1, i + k); x++) {
                    for (int y = q; y <= Math.min(n - 1, j + k); y++) {
                        val += mat[x][y];
                    }
                }
                answer[i][j] = val;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
