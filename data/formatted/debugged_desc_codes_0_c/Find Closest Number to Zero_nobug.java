There is a bug in the provided code. The bug type is a logical error. 

To identify and fix the bug, follow these steps:
1. The code iterates through the array `nums` to find the number with the absolute value closest to 0 and handle the case if the absolute value is the same, in which case the largest value should be chosen.
2. We need to consider the case when the input array `nums` is empty. In this case, the function should return 0, as there are no elements to compare.
3. During iteration, when initializing `closest_num` to 0, it should be assigned `nums[0]` so that it has the initial value of the first element in the array.

Here's the updated code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findClosestNumber(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int closest_num = nums[0]; // Initialize with the first element
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (min > Math.abs(n)) {
                min = Math.abs(n);
                closest_num = n;
            } else if (min == Math.abs(n) && closest_num < n) {
                closest_num = n;
            }
        }
        return closest_num;
    }
}
```
In this fix, we have added a check for an empty array and initialized `closest_num` with the first element in the array.
