The bug in the provided code is that it does not consider the case where there is no sequence from beginWord to endWord in the dictionary. The code returns 0 if the endWord is not reached, but it does not consider the case where it is impossible to reach the endWord from the given beginWord.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if the queue becomes empty in the while loop, we return 0, indicating that there is no transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord.

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        int count = 1;
        Set<String> words = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(beginWord);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();

            while (size-- > 0) {
                String word = q.poll();
                char[] chList = word.toCharArray();

                for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
                    char tmp = chList[i];

                    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
                        chList[i] = c;
                        String newWord = new String(chList);

                        if (words.contains(newWord)) {
                            if (newWord.equals(endWord)) {
                                return count + 1;
                            }
                            q.offer(newWord);
                            words.remove(newWord);
                        }
                    }

                    chList[i] = tmp;
                }
            }

            count++;
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```
