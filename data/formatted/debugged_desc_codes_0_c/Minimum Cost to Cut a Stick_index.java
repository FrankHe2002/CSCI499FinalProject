The provided Java code has a bug in the cut() method, where an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is being generated.
The bug occurs in the condition `int cost = cuts[j + 1] - cuts[i - 1] + cut(cuts, i, k - 1, dp) + cut(cuts, k + 1, j, dp)`. The reason for the bug is that the checks `cuts[j + 1]` and `cuts[i - 1]` are going out of bounds when `j` is already at the upper bound of the array and `i` is at the lower bound.

Here's the corrected and explained code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minCost(int n, int[] cuts) {
        Arrays.sort(cuts);
        int[] arr = new int[cuts.length + 2];
      
        // Copy the sorted cuts into the new array
        for (int i = 1; i <= cuts.length; i++)
            arr[i] = cuts[i - 1];
        
        arr[0] = 0;
        arr[cuts.length + 1] = n;
      
        int[][] dp = new int[cuts.length + 2][cuts.length + 2];
        // Initialize the dp array with -1
        for (int i = 0; i <= cuts.length + 1; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], -1);
        }
        
        return cut(arr, 0, cuts.length + 1, dp); // Pass the correct start and end indices
    }

    int cut(int[] cuts, int i, int j, int[][] dp) {
        if (i + 1 >= j) // Changed the condition to check if i + 1 is greater than or equal to j
            return 0;

        if (dp[i][j] != -1)
            return dp[i][j];

        int mini = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) { // Changed the loop to start from i + 1 and end at j - 1
            int cost = cuts[j] - cuts[i] + cut(cuts, i, k, dp) + cut(cuts, k, j, dp);
            mini = Math.min(cost, mini);
        }

        return dp[i][j] = mini;
    }
}
```

In the modified code, the following changes were made:
1. In the minCost() method, the start and end indices passed to the cut() method were modified to 0 and cuts.length + 1 respectively to avoid accessing elements outside the array bounds.
2. In the cut() method, the condition `if (i + 1 >= j)` was changed to check if `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `j`.
3. The loop in the cut() method was modified to start from `i + 1` and end at `j - 1` to eliminate out-of-bounds index access and looping through the elements properly.

These changes address the bug and provide the correct results.
