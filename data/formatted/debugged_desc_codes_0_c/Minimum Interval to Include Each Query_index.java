Bug type: Logical error

There is a logical error in the code on the line `q[i][j] = queries[i];`. It should be `q[i][1] = queries[i];` instead.

Explanation:
1. The code sorts the intervals array based on the start point of the intervals, which is correct.
2. It initializes a 2D array q to store the queries and their index.
3. It then sorts the array q based on the query values, which is also correct.
4. A priority queue (min heap) is used to store the minimum intervals.
5. The code processes the queries and updates the result array based on the intervals present in the priority queue.

However, the bug is in the line `q[i][j] = queries[i];`. The variable `j` is not declared or defined, and it should be replaced with `1` to reference the second column of the 2D array q.

Below is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] minInterval(int[][] intervals, int[] queries) {
        //sort intervals
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        //add [index,query]
        int[][] q = new int[queries.length][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            q[i][0] = i;
            q[i][1] = queries[i]; // Fix: updated index to 1 (instead of j)
        }
        //sort the queries by query val
        Arrays.sort(q, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        //store the minimum intervals in the priority queue, min heap
        Queue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (a[1] - a[0]) - (b[1] - b[0]));
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < q.length; i++) {
            int index = q[i][0];
            int val = q[i][1];
            // if start is less than query val, then add to pq
            while (j < intervals.length && intervals[j][0] <= val) pq.offer(intervals[j++]);
            //anything which has the end lesser than the val then remove it
            while (! pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek()[1] < val) pq.poll();
            //add difference to the result
            result[index] = pq.isEmpty() ? -1 : pq.peek()[1] - pq.peek()[0] + 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
