The given code is trying to find the minimum number of operations needed to perform on the permutation array to return it to its initial value. 

Upon reviewing the code, there seems to be a logic error. The logic used to calculate the minimum number of operations is incorrect.

To identify the bug in the code, let's analyze the logic used in the while loop. The while loop condition `while (true)` indicates an indefinite loop where the condition is later checked inside the loop. Inside the loop, the condition `if (num % (n - 1) == 1)` is used to check if the current number satisfies the condition to break the loop. If the condition is not satisfied, `ans` is incremented, and `num` is updated. However, the update for `num` is incorrect, and the condition for breaking the loop seems unsound.

To fix this issue, we need to change the logic used to calculate the minimum number of operations. The calculation should be based on the number of iterations it takes to return the permutation to its original state. 

Here's the updated code with the correct logic:

```java
class Solution {
    public int reinitializePermutation(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        int num = 1;
        do {
            if (num < n / 2) {
                num *= 2;
            } else {
                num = (num - n / 2) * 2 + 1;
            }
            ans++;
        } while (num != 1);
        return ans;
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, I have used a do-while loop to iterate until the permutation is back to its original state. Inside the loop, I have used the correct logic to calculate the next value of `num` based on the current state and incrementing `ans` in each iteration.

This solution ensures that the correct number of operations needed to return the permutation to its initial value is calculated.
