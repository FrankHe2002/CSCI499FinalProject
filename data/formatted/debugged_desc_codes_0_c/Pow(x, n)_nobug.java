Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
The code seems to be using a recursive approach to calculate x raised to the power n. However, there are issues with the conditions and the calculation logic in the recursive part of the function.

1. The conditions for n == 1 and n == -1 should be handled before the recursive call because they are base cases.
2. The conditions for n % 2 == -1 and else are not valid ways to check for odd and even numbers.

Let's fix the code by handling the base cases separately and correcting the conditions for checking odd and even numbers.

Code with minimal changes:
```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return x;
        if (n == -1) return 1 / x;

        double res = myPow(x, n / 2);
        if (n % 2 == 0) return res * res;
        if (n % 2 == 1) return res * res * x;
        return res * res * (n < 0 ? 1 / x : x);
    }
}
```
