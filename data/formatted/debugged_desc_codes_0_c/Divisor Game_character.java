Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning:
The given code only checks if the number n is even or odd, and returns true if n is even. However, it does not properly implement the game rules to determine if Alice wins the game.

Fix:
The fix involves implementing the game rules in the `divisorGame` method. We can create a boolean array `dp` to keep track of the results for each value of `n`. Then, we can use dynamic programming to determine if Alice wins the game by checking all possible moves and their outcomes.

Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean divisorGame(int n) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n+1];
        dp[1] = false; // Base case
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
                if (i % j == 0 && !dp[i - j]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
