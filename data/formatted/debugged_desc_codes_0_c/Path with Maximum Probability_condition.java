Bug Type: Logic Bug

There is a logic bug in the while loop inside the `maxProbability` method. The bug occurs when checking whether the product of the current probability and the edge probability is less than the probability of the destination node and then updating the probability array and the priority queue.

Here are the steps to identify and fix the bug:

1. The code initializes an array `probs` to store the probability of reaching each node from the starting node. The array is initialized with 0's and the probability of the starting node is set to 1.0.

2. Inside the while loop, the code dequeues the pair from the priority queue and then iterates over the adjacent nodes. For each adjacent node, it checks if the product of the current probability and the edge probability is less than the probability stored in the `probs` array for the destination node. If it is less, it updates the `probs` array and enqueues the new pair in the priority queue.

3. The bug occurs because the condition for updating the `probs` and enqueuing the pair is incorrect. The condition should compare the new probability with the probability already in the `probs` array, and if the new probability is greater, then it should update the `probs` array and enqueue the new pair. However, the current code compares the product of probabilities against the probability already in the `probs` array.

To fix the bug, the comparison in the condition should be corrected, and the `probs` array should also be updated inside the loop to reflect the maximum probability of reaching each node.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double maxProbability(int n, int[][] edges, double[] succProb, int start, int end) {
        List<List<Pair>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Pair>());
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
            adj.get(edges[i][0]).add(new Pair(edges[i][1], succProb[i]));
            adj.get(edges[i][1]).add(new Pair(edges[i][0], succProb[i]));
        }
        double[] probs = new double[n];
        Arrays.fill(probs, 0.0);
        probs[start] = 1.0;
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((p1, p2) -> Double.compare(p2.prob, p1.prob));
        pq.offer(new Pair(start, 1.0));
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Pair curr = pq.poll();
            for (Pair x : adj.get(curr.to)) {
                if ((curr.prob * x.prob) > probs[x.to]) {
                    probs[x.to] = curr.prob * x.prob;
                    pq.offer(new Pair(x.to, probs[x.to]));
                }
            }
        }
        return probs[end];
    }
}
```
