There is a bug in the given code. The bug occurs in the line `seen = seen | (2 << ci);`, where the bit manipulation is incorrect. The correct operation should be a bitwise OR, but the code uses bit shifting instead.

To fix the bug, I need to change the line `seen = seen | (2 << ci);` to `seen = seen | (1 << ci);`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkIfPangram(String sentence) {
        int seen = 0;
        for (char c : sentence.toCharArray()) {
            int ci = c - 'a';
            seen = seen | (1 << ci);
        }
        return seen == ((1 << 26) - 1);
    }
}
```
