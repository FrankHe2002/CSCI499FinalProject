The code provided has a bug. 

Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process for identifying the bug:
1. The code is supposed to find the length of the longest substring between two equal characters.
2. The variable "ans" is set to -1 initially, but it should be initialized to 0 as that will be the length of the longest substring.
3. Within the for loop, the calculation of the longest substring length is incorrect. It should be i - map.get(ch) - 1 instead of i - 1 - map.get(ch).

Applying the fix to the code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(String s) {
        int ans = 0; // Fix: initialize ans to 0
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (map.containsKey(ch)) {
                ans = Math.max(ans, i - map.get(ch) - 1); // Fix: Correct the calculation for the substring length
            } else {
                map.put(ch, i);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
