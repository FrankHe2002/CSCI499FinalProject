The bug type in the provided code is a logical error. 

The code is trying to find the number of ways to write the number n as the sum of consecutive positive integers. The current logic uses the triangular number formula to find the maximum triangular number that is less than or equal to n, and then iterates through the triangular numbers to find the ones that can be expressed as the sum of consecutive positive integers.

The bug occurs in the logic for iterating through the triangular numbers and checking if they can be expressed as the sum of consecutive positive integers. The logic for checking if the difference is divisible by m is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly check if the difference is divisible by m, and update the logic to count the number of ways to express n as the sum of consecutive positive integers.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) {
        final double eightN = (8d * ((double) n)); 
        final int maxTriangular = (int) Math.floor((- 1d + Math.sqrt(1d + eightN)) / 2d);
        int ways = 0;  // Start with 0 ways
        for (int m = 1; m <= maxTriangular; ++m) { // Changed starting index from 2 to 1
            if ((n - (m * (m - 1) / 2)) % m == 0) { // Check if difference is divisible by m
                ways++;
            }
        }
        return ways;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the following changes were made:
- Changed the initialization of `ways` to 0, as there should be no initial way to express n as the sum of consecutive positive integers
- Changed the starting index of `m` to 1, as it should start from 1 to find all possible ways to express n
- Modified the condition to check if the difference is divisible by m by using the formula for the triangular numbers (`m * (m - 1) / 2`) to accurately compute the sum of consecutive positive integers and then check if the difference is divisible by m.

These changes will fix the logical error in the code and correctly count the number of ways to express n as the sum of consecutive positive integers.
