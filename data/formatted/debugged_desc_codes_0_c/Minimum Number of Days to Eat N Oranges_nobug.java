The code has a bug in the `dp` function. It doesn't handle the case when n is not divisible by 2 or 3 properly. 

To fix this bug, I'll update the `dp` function to consider all possible actions for each day and return the minimum of all possible days.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map;

    public int minDays(int n) {
        map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(0, 0);
        map.put(1, 1);
        return dp(n);
    }

    public int dp(int n) {
        if (map.containsKey(n))
            return map.get(n);
        
        int one = 1 + n % 2 + dp(n / 2);
        int two = 1 + n % 3 + dp(n / 3);
        
        int result = Math.min(one, two);
        
        map.put(n, result);
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

In this fix, I made sure to check if the `map` contains the value for `n` with `map.containsKey(n)` rather than `map.get(n) != null`, and I updated the calculation of `one` and `two` to include the remainder `n % 2` and `n % 3` correctly. Then I calculated the minimum of `one` and `two`, saved it in the `map`, and then returned the `result`.
