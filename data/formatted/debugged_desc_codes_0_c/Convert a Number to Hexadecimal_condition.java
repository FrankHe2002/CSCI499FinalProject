The code provided has a bug. The bug creates an infinite loop as it returns `"0"` if `num` is not equal to `0`. However, it should return `"0"` only when the input `num` is equal to `0`. Another bug is the `start` boolean variable is incorrectly set to `true` at the beginning instead of `false`.

Here's how the bugs can be identified and fixed:

1. The main issue is with the condition `if (num != 0) return "0";`. This condition should check if `num` is equal to `0` and return `"0"` only in that case. Also, the condition should be removed to accurately represent the hexadecimal representation of the input number. 

2. The `start` variable should be initialized to `false` initially.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String toHex(int num) {
        boolean start = false;

        if (num == 0) return "0"; // Return "0" only if num is equal to 0

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 28; i >= 0; i -= 4) {
            int digit = (num >> i) & 15;
            if (digit > 9) {
                char curr = (char) (digit % 10 + 'a');
                sb.append(curr);
                start = false;
            } else if (digit != 0) {
                char curr = (char) (digit + '0');
                sb.append(curr);
                start = false;
            } else { // digit == 0
                if (start == false) {
                    sb.append('0');
                }
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
In the above code, the condition `if (num == 0) return "0";` is adjusted to check if `num` is equal to `0` and return `"0"` accordingly. Additionally, the `start` variable is initialized to `false` at the beginning.
