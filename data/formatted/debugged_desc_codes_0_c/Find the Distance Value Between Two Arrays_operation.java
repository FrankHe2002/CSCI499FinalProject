The code's logic looks correct, but the bug appears to be a variable mix-up. The issue is with the variable x, which should be incremented for each element in arr1 that satisfies the condition. However, in the current implementation, x is incremented regardless of whether the condition is satisfied or not.

To fix this bug, we need to increment x only when the condition is not satisfied for all elements in arr2. We can achieve this by adding a boolean flag to track the satisfaction of the condition for each element of arr1.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 68.55%) | Memory: 44.9 MB (Top 25.67-)
class Solution {
    public int findTheDistanceValue(int[] arr1, int[] arr2, int d) {
        int x = 0;
        for (int i : arr1) {
            boolean satisfied = true;
            for (int j : arr2) {
                if (Math.abs(i - j) <= d) {
                    satisfied = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (satisfied) {
                x++;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```
