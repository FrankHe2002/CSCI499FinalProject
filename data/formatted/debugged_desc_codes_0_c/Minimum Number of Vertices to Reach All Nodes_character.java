The bug in the provided Java code is a syntax error due to the missing opening and closing braces for the for loop. This results in a compilation error.

To fix the bug, the missing opening and closing braces for the for loop need to be added.

Here's the modified code with the added braces:

```java
// Runtime: 18 ms (Top 43.75%) | Memory: 119 MB (Top 77.96%)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, List<List<Integer>> edges) {

        int[] indegree = new int[n];

        for (List<Integer> edge : edges) {
            indegree[edge.get(1)]++;
        }

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed, and the code will now compile and run successfully.
