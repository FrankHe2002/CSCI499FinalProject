Bug type: Logical error.

Reasoning process:
1. The while loop runs until `k` is greater than 0, which is correct.
2. Inside the while loop, it calculates the Fibonacci numbers and subtracts `fib2prev` from `k` to reduce the sum, which seems correct.
3. However, the line `ans /= 1;` is supposed to increment the answer (ans) by 1, but the code incorrectly uses the division assignment operator `/=` instead of the increment operator `+=`.

Fix:
Change `ans /= 1;` to `ans += 1;`

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinFibonacciNumbers(int k) {
        int ans = 0;

        while (k > 0) {
            int fib2prev = 1;
            int fib1prev = 1;
            while (fib1prev <= k) {
                int temp = fib2prev + fib1prev;
                fib2prev = fib1prev;
                fib1prev = temp;
            }
            k -= fib2prev;
            ans += 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
