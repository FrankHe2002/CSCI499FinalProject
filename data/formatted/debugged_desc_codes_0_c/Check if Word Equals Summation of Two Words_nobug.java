Bug type:
The code has a logical error. The issue occurs when calculating the numerical value of the strings. The summation is not performed correctly because the code incorrectly multiplies the sum by 10 inside the loop.

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a loop to iterate through each character of the strings and calculate their numerical value by subtracting 'a' from each character.
2. Inside the loop for each string, the current numerical value is multiplied by 10.
3. Finally, the code checks whether the sum of the firstWord and secondWord equals the numerical value of targetWord.

Identifying the bug:
The bug occurs when the sum is being updated by multiplying by 10 inside the loop. This causes the incorrect numerical value to be calculated for each word.

Suggested fix:
Move the multiplication by 10 outside the loop, after calculating the full numerical value of each word.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSumEqual(String firstWord, String secondWord, String targetWord) {
        int sumfirst = 0, sumsecond = 0, sumtarget = 0;
        for (char c : firstWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumfirst = (sumfirst * 10) + (c - 'a');
        }
        for (char c : secondWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumsecond = (sumsecond * 10) + (c - 'a');
        }
        for (char c : targetWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumtarget = (sumtarget * 10) + (c - 'a');
        }

        return (sumfirst + sumsecond) == sumtarget;
    }
}
```

The bug is identified and fixed by moving the multiplication by 10 outside of the loop in each case, ensuring that the full numerical value of each word is calculated correctly.
