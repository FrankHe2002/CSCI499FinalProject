The identified bug in the code is the recursive call to the "maxValue" method within the specific condition. 

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows:
- The bug type is a logic error that causes the recursive call within the specific condition to be incorrect.
- The code attempts to handle the case when the previous event has not completed before the current event, but there is a typo in the recursive call. This results in the recursive call using "index / 1" instead of "index + 1", leading to incorrect function execution. 
- The condition `if (lastEventEndDay >= events[index][0])` is responsible for checking if the previous event has not completed before the current event.
- The fixed recursive call within this condition should be `return maxValue(events, index + 1, remainingEvents, lastEventEndDay, dp);` to skip to the next event without attending the current one.

The following is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxValue(int[][] events, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(events, (e1, e2) -> (e1[0] == e2[0] ? e1[1] - e2[1] : e1[0] - e2[0]));
        return maxValue(events, 0, k, 0, new int[k + 1][events.length]);
    }

    private int maxValue(int[][] events, int index, int remainingEvents, int lastEventEndDay, int[][] dp) {
        // Return 0 if no events are left or maximum choice is reached
        if (index >= events.length || remainingEvents == 0)
            return 0;

        // An Event cannot be picked if the previous event has not completed before current event
        if (lastEventEndDay >= events[index][0])
            return maxValue(events, index + 1, remainingEvents, lastEventEndDay, dp);

        // Return the value if the solution is already available
        if (dp[remainingEvents][index] != 0)
            return dp[remainingEvents][index];

        // There are 2 choices that we can make,
        // SKIP this meeting or PICK this meeting
        return dp[remainingEvents][index] = Math.max(
                maxValue(events, index + 1, remainingEvents, lastEventEndDay, dp), // skip
                maxValue(events, index + 1, remainingEvents - 1, events[index][1], dp) + events[index][2] // pick
        );
    }
}
```
