The bug in the code is a logical error in the calculation of the difference in cities and weights.

The first step in the algorithm creates two arrays: diffCity and weights. The purpose of these arrays is to keep track of the number of different cities and the total weight from the beginning up to the current index.

The process begins by iterating through the boxes array to fill the diffCity and weights arrays. However, there is a logical error in the calculation of the difference in cities and weights.

The issue arises in this line of code:
```java
diffCity[i + 1] = diffCity[i] + ((i != 0 && boxes[i][0] == boxes[i - 1][0]) ? 0 : 1;
```
The error here is missing a closing parenthesis in the ternary operator, causing a compilation error.

To fix this issue, we need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of the line:
```java
diffCity[i + 1] = diffCity[i] + ((i != 0 && boxes[i][0] == boxes[i - 1][0]) ? 0 : 1);
```

After fixing the bug, the corrected code looks like this:

```java
class Solution {
    public int boxDelivering(int[][] boxes, int portsCount, int maxBoxes, int maxWeight) {
        int[] diffCity = new int[boxes.length + 1];
        int[] weights = new int[boxes.length + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < boxes.length; i++) {
            diffCity[i + 1] = diffCity[i] + ((i != 0 && boxes[i][0] == boxes[i - 1][0]) ? 0 : 1);
            weights[i + 1] = weights[i] + boxes[i][1];
        }
        int[] dp = new int[boxes.length + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0] = 0;
        diffCity[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= boxes.length; i++) { // offset by 1 since our above logic reaches dp[-1]
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                int dC = diffCity[i] - diffCity[j + 1];
                int w = weights[i] - weights[j];
                int b = i - j;
                if (b <= maxBoxes && w <= maxWeight) {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], 2 + dC + dp[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[boxes.length];
    }
}
```
