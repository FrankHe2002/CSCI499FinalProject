Bug Type: Logical Error

1. The while loop condition `while (curr == null)` is incorrect. It should be `while (curr != null)` to ensure that the loop runs as long as there are nodes in the tree.

2. The condition `if (curr.left != null)` should be inside the while loop in order to check for the left child of the current node in every iteration.

3. The while loop `while (curr == null)` should be `while (curr != null)` to iterate through all the nodes.

4. The `curr` pointer should be updated to the right child of the current node after linking the left subtree to the right child.

5. The function should return the updated root node after flattening the binary tree.

Below is the modified code with the identified issues fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.left != null) {
                TreeNode prev = curr.left;
                while (prev.right != null)
                    prev = prev.right;
                prev.right = curr.right;
                curr.right = curr.left;
                curr.left = null;
            }
            curr = curr.right;
        }
    }
}
```
