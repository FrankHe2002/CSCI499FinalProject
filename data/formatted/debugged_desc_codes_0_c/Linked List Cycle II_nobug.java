The bug in the given code is an incorrect initialization of the "hare" node. The "hare" node should start from the same position as the "tortoise" node and move twice as fast. However, in the given code, "hare" is starting from the next node of the "head".

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The tortoise and hare algorithm is used to detect the cycle in the linked list. The initial position for both tortoise and hare should be the head of the linked list.
2. In the provided code, the hare is incorrectly initialized, and its "next" pointer is set to the next node after the head. This is incorrect.
3. The hare and tortoise should start at the same position, and hare should move twice as fast as the tortoise.
4. The algorithm to detect the cycle and find the node where the cycle begins should be implemented correctly.

I will fix the bug in the code by correcting the initialization of the "hare" node and changing the while condition for the hare and tortoise movement to avoid NullPointerException.

Below is the corrected code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode tortoise = head;
        ListNode hare = head;
        while (hare != null && hare.next != null) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next.next;
            if (hare == tortoise) {
                ListNode ptr = head;
                while (ptr != tortoise) {
                    ptr = ptr.next;
                    tortoise = tortoise.next;
                }
                return ptr;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
