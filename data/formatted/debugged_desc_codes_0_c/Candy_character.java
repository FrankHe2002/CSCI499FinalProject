The bug in the provided code is in the second for loop where we check from right to left if the element after the current element has a greater rating. The condition for the if statement is not properly defined, and also we are missing curly brackets in the if statement. It should be using a comparison operator to check if the right neighbor has more candies, and then increase the current element's candies accordingly.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 14.09%) | Memory: 53.1 MB (Top 8.48%)
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {

        int[] left = new int[ratings.length];
        Arrays.fill(left, 1);

        // we are checking from left to right that if the element next to our current element has greater rating, if yes then we are increasing their candy
        for (int i = 0; i < ratings.length - 1; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] < ratings[i + 1])
                left[i + 1] = left[i] + 1;
        }

        int[] right = new int[ratings.length];
        Arrays.fill(right, 1);

        // we are checking from right to left if the element after than our current element is greater or not, if yes then we are also checking their candies and if the greater rating has less number of candies then we increase their candy
        for (int i = ratings.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1] && right[i] <= right[i + 1]) {
                right[i] = right[i + 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < right.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.max(right[i], left[i]);
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```
