Bug: The code does not correctly calculate the maximum distance to the closest person.

1. The start variable should be set to -1 initially, not at the previous end value, and the max variable should be set to the max of i (the current distance from the beginning) and the previous max value.
2. The calculation of the maximum distance should be updated to handle the edge case when there is only a single '1' in the array. 
3. The last if statement should be updated to correctly handle the special case when the last element is 0.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
        int size = seats.length;
        int max = 0;
        int start = -1;
        int end = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (seats[i] == 1) {
                if (start == -1) {
                    max = i;  
                } else {
                    max = Math.max((i - start) / 2, max);
                }
                start = i;
            }
        }

        // Handle special cases before returning max
        if (seats[size - 1] == 0) return Math.max(max, size - 1 - start);
        return max;
    }
}
```
