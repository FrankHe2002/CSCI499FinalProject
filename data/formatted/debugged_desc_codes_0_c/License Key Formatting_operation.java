The code provided has a bug. The bug is in the condition `length / k == 0` inside the for loop. The intention seems to be to add a dash after the first group (which can have a length less than k), and then after every k characters, but this condition is not suitable for that logic.

To fix the bug:

- We need to add a counter to keep track of the number of characters added so far in the current group.
- We should add a dash after every k characters except for the first group.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder();
        int length = 0;
        int groupLength = 0; // Counter for the number of characters in the current group
        // Iterate Backwards to fulfill first group condition
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '-') {
                continue;
            }
            if (groupLength > 0 && groupLength % k == 0) { // Check if we need to add a dash
                answer.append('-');
            }
            answer.append(Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(i)));
            length++;
            groupLength++; // Increment the counter for the current group
        }
        return answer.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
