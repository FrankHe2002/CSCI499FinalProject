The code provided is attempting to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of steps needed to make the grid valid by swapping two adjacent rows of the grid. The primary bug in the code is the nested for loop related to swapping the rows and identifying a valid row. The inner for loop and the conditional checks need to be revised as well. 

Hereâ€™s the revised code with comments explaining the changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length, ans = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            int fittingRow = -1;
            for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
                boolean found = true;
                for (int j = k + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                        found = false; // If a 1 is found in the row, it is no longer a valid fitting row
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (found) {
                    fittingRow = i;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (fittingRow == -1) {
                return -1; // If no valid fitting row is found, return -1
            }
            for (int m = fittingRow; m > k; m--) {
                int[] temp = grid[m];
                grid[m] = grid[m - 1];
                grid[m - 1] = temp;
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

In the revised code:
1. I removed the variable `cur` as it was not being utilized.
2. Adjusted the conditional statements within the loops to properly check for fitting rows and 1's in the grid.
3. Changed the loop conditions to check until `n` instead of `n-1`.
4. Updated the logic for swapping rows to ensure each iteration reduces to the correct row.

These changes will enable the code to correctly identify the valid fitting row and swap the rows to make the grid valid with the minimum number of steps.
