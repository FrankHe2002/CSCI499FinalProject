There is a typo in line 5 of the code where the difference between two elements is calculated. The code should be "int diff = arr[l] - arr[r];" instead of "int diff = arr[l] - arr[2];". 

Additionally, there's a bug in line 22 where the index 2 in "arr[2]" should be replaced with the variable "i" so it should be "int diff = arr[i] - arr[i + 1];".

Lastly, the condition for even and odd indices is not handled correctly. The conditions for checking if the next difference is less than 0 and is equal to 0 should be swapped for the even and odd indices in lines 27-34.

The corrected code will look like this:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTurbulenceSize(int[] arr) {
        if (arr.length == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int diff = 0;
        int max = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            int nextDiff = arr[i] - arr[i + 1];
            if (i % 2 == 0) { // Even index
                if (nextDiff >= 0) {
                    l = i;
                } else {
                    r = i + 1;
                }
            } else { // Odd index
                if (nextDiff <= 0) {
                    l = i;
                } else {
                    r = i + 1;
                }
            }
            if (arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) {
                l = i + 1;
                r = i + 1;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
