The while loop condition `while (left > right)` is incorrect and will cause the loop to never execute because `left` is initially 0 and `right` is initially `people.length - 1`, so `left` is not greater than `right`. This will result in `boatCount` being returned as 0, which is not the correct result.

To fix this, change the condition to `while (left <= right)` in order to iterate through the people array correctly.

Here's the modified code:

```java
// Runtime: 24 ms (Top 38.47%) | Memory: 65.6 MB (Top 33.01%)
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        int boatCount = 0;
        Arrays.sort(people);

        int left = 0;
        int right = people.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) { 
            int sum = people[left] + people[right];
            if (sum <= limit) {
                boatCount++;
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                boatCount++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return boatCount;
    }
}
```
