There are multiple bugs in the code:

1. The method signature for the `helper` method is incorrect. It should be `int helper(int idx, int[] houses, int[][] cost, int target, int prevColor, int neigh, Integer[][][] dp)` instead of `int helper(int idx, int[ houses, int[][] cost, int target, int prevColor, int neigh, Integer[][][] dp)`. The array parameters have incorrect syntax.

2. The if condition for checking if `neigh > target` is invalid. It should be `if (idx == houses.length || neigh > target)` to correctly check if the end of the houses array is reached or the neighborhood count exceeds the target.

3. In the `minCostHere` calculation, `j + 1` should be used as the color instead of just `j`.

4. The `helper` method should return `-1` when it's not possible to paint the houses, but it returns `Integer.MAX_VALUE` in the base case. This should be changed to `-1`.

5. The `minCost` calculation is incorrect and can be simplified.

6. The `minCost` check condition for `minCostHere` is redundant and can be simplified. 

Fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 70 ms (Top 34.94%) | Memory: 52.8 MB (Top 34.74%)
class Solution {
    public int helper(int idx, int[] houses, int[][] cost, int target, int prevColor, int neigh, Integer[][][] dp) {
        if (idx == houses.length || neigh > target) {
            if (neigh == target)
                return 0;
            return -1;
        }
        if (dp[idx][prevColor][neigh] != null)
            return dp[idx][prevColor][neigh];
        int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        if (houses[idx] == 0) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cost[idx].length; j++) {
                int minCostHere;

                if (j + 1 == prevColor) // Painting the house with the same colour as that of the previous one.
                    minCostHere = helper(idx + 1, houses, cost, target, prevColor, neigh, dp);
                else // Painting the house with a different color and incrementing the neighbour count.
                    minCostHere = helper(idx + 1, houses, cost, target, j + 1, neigh + 1, dp);

                if (minCostHere != -1)
                    minCost = Math.min(minCost, minCostHere + cost[idx][j]);
            }
        } else {
            if (houses[idx] == prevColor)
                minCost = helper(idx + 1, houses, cost, target, prevColor, neigh, dp);
            else
                minCost = helper(idx + 1, houses, cost, target, houses[idx], neigh + 1, dp);
        }

        return dp[idx][prevColor][neigh] = minCost;
    }

    public int minCost(int[] houses, int[][] cost, int m, int n, int target) {
        Integer[][][] dp = new Integer[m][n + 1][target + 1];
        int ans = helper(0, houses, cost, target, 0, 0, dp);
        return ans;
    }
}
