The given Java code contains logical bugs.

Bug type:
The bug type in the given code is a logical bug.

Reasoning:
1. The code is intended to iterate through each query and check if it matches the given pattern.
2. The code uses a flag to keep track of whether the pattern matches the query.
3. The outer loop iterates through each query, and the inner loop iterates through each character in the query.
4. The inner loop checks if the current character in the query matches the character in the pattern. If it does, it increments the index.
5. If the character is an uppercase letter, it checks if it matches the character in the pattern. If not, it sets the flag to false and breaks the loop.
6. After the inner loop, the code checks if the flag is true and if the index is equal to the length of the pattern. If both conditions are true, it adds true to the list, otherwise false.

The bug occurs at the point where if the character is an uppercase letter and it doesn't match the pattern's character, the flag is not being set to false correctly.

To fix this logical bug, the comparison for uppercase letters should be adjusted to handle the case when the character in the query is not equal to the current pattern character.

Code with Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> camelMatch(String[] queries, String pattern) {
        List<Boolean> list = new ArrayList<>();

        for (var q : queries) {
            int index = 0;
            boolean flag = true;
            for (var c : q.toCharArray()) {
                if (index < pattern.length() && c == pattern.charAt(index)) {
                    index++;
                    continue;
                }
                if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
                    flag = false;  // Set flag to false if uppercase letter does not match pattern
                    break;
                }
            }
            flag = flag && index == pattern.length();
            list.add(flag);
        }
        return list;
    }
}
```
