The given Java code appears to be correct. The function hammingWeight takes an integer n as an input and returns the number of '1' bits it has using the built-in Integer.bitCount() method, which counts the number of one-bits in the two's complement binary representation of the specified int value.

There doesn't seem to be any bug in the code, as the implementation follows the correct logic for the given problem.

Therefore, no bug fix is needed as the code is correct.

Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        return Integer.bitCount(n);
    }
}
```
