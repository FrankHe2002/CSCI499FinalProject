There are a few syntax errors in the given code snippet. I will identify and fix the syntax errors by following a step-by-step process.

1. Syntax Error:
   In method can(), the for loop to iterate through the heaters array, there seems to be a syntax error in calculating the 'to' variable.

   Fix:
   Change `heatersi]` to `heaters[i]` to correctly access the 'i-th' element of the heaters array.

2. Syntax Error:
   In the same method can(), in the for loop to iterate through the houses array, there seems to be a syntax error in accessing the 'to' and 'from' variables.

   Fix:
   Change `houses[j] <= to` and `houses[j] >= from` to `houses[j] <= to` and `houses[j] >= from` to correctly compare the house positions with the range of the heaters.

3. Syntax Error:
   In the method findRadius(), there is a missing import statement for the Arrays class.

   Fix:
   Add the import statement `import java.util.Arrays;` at the beginning of the file to correctly import the Arrays class.

Here's the updated code with the fixes:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public boolean can(int r, int[] houses, int[] heaters) {
        int prevHouseIdx = - 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < heaters.length; i++) {
            int from = heaters[i] - r;
            int to = heaters[i] + r;
            for (int j = prevHouseIdx + 1; j < houses.length; j++) {
                if (houses[j] <= to && houses[j] >= from) {
                    prevHouseIdx++;
                } else break;
            }
            if (prevHouseIdx >= houses.length - 1) return true;
        }
        return prevHouseIdx >= houses.length - 1;
    }

    public int findRadius(int[] houses, int[] heaters) {
        Arrays.sort(houses);
        Arrays.sort(heaters);
        int lo = 0, hi = 1000000004;
        int mid, ans = hi;
        while (lo <= hi) {
            mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if (can(mid, houses, heaters)) {
                ans = mid;
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else lo = mid + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

With those changes, the syntax errors have been fixed, and the code should now compile and run as intended.
