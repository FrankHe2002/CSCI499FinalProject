First, let's analyze the logic of the code to see if there's any bug.

The code appears to shift the characters in the string based on the shifts array. It calculates the shift for each character and then calculates the new character by adding the shift to the ASCII value of the character. If the resulting value is greater than 'z', it adjusts the shift accordingly.

One bug in the code is that the array `arr1` has an issue with its declaration due to a missing closing square bracket. This will cause a compilation error.

Also, the logic to calculate the new character after the shift seems incorrect. It needs to correctly wrap around the lowercase English letters and handle the overflow.

To fix the first issue:
- Add the missing closing square bracket in the declaration of `arr1`.

To fix the second issue:
- Modify the logic for calculating the new character after the shift to properly wrap around the lowercase English letters and handle the overflow.

Here's the updated code with the fixes:

```java
class Solution {
    public String shiftingLetters(String s, int[] shifts) {
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int[] arr1 = new int[shifts.length];
        arr1[arr1.length - 1] = shifts[shifts.length - 1] % 26;
        for (int i = shifts.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            arr1[i] = (shifts[i] + arr1[i + 1]) % 26;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int c = (int) (arr[i]) - 'a';
            int n = (c + arr1[i]) % 26;
            char ch = (char) (n + 'a');
            arr[i] = ch;
        }
        String string = new String(arr);
        return string;
    }
}
```
