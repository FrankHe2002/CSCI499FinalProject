The code provided contains a bug. The bug stems from the incorrect usage of ArrayList's `lastIndexOf` method to determine if two strings are isomorphic.

The `lastIndexOf` method returns the index within the ArrayList of the last occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if the element is not found. Therefore, using `lastIndexOf` in this manner does not accurately map the characters of the strings to check for isomorphism.

The correct approach for checking if two strings are isomorphic is to use a HashMap to map characters from one string to another and ensure that no two characters are mapped to the same character.

Below is the corrected code with the bug fixed:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        HashMap<Character, Character> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c1 = s.charAt(i);
            char c2 = t.charAt(i);
            
            if (map.containsKey(c1)) {
                if (map.get(c1) != c2) {
                    return false; // the character is mapped to a different character in t
                }
            } else {
                if (map.containsValue(c2)) {
                    return false; // c2 is already mapped to by a different character in s
                }
                map.put(c1, c2);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, we use a HashMap to map each character from string `s` to its corresponding character in string `t`. We iterate through all characters in the strings, and if the character from `s` is already in the map, we check if the corresponding character in `t` matches the expected value. If it does not match, we return `false`. If the character in `s` is not in the map, we also check if the character in `t` is already mapped to by a different character in `s`, and if it is, we return `false`. Otherwise, we update the mapping and continue to the next character. If we reach the end of the loop, then the strings are isomorphic, and we return `true`.
