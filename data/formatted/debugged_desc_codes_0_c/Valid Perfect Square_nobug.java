There is a bug in the given code. The issue is with the comparison of `mid * mid` and `num`. Since we are dealing with integers, if `mid * mid` exceeds the limit of `int` data type, it will cause an overflow and result in incorrect comparisons.

To fix this, we can change the data type of `mid`, `start`, and `end` to `long`. This will prevent potential overflow issues, ensuring the comparison of `mid * mid` and `num` is accurate.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long start = 1L;
        long end = num;

        while (start <= end) {
            long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (mid * mid == num) {
                return true;
            } else if (mid * mid < num) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
