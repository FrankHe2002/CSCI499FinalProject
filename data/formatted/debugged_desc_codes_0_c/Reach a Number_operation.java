The given Java code has a bug. The issue is in the while loop condition of the second while loop. The condition should be `while (((sum - target) % 2 != 0))` which will never be true if the steps are added in an alternating pattern. Therefore, I will change the condition to `while (((sum - target) % 2 != 0) || (sum < target))` to resolve the bug in the code.

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        int sum = 0, steps = 0;
        if (target == 0) return 0;
        target = Math.abs(target);
        while (sum < target) {
            sum += steps;
            steps++;
        }

        while (((sum - target) % 2 != 0) || (sum < target)) {
            sum += steps;
            steps++;
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
```
