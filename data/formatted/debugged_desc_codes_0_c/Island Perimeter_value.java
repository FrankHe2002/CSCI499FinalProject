The bug in the code is in the first if condition where it checks if the grid is null or if the grid length is -1, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to change `grid.length == -1` to `grid.length == 0` in the first if condition. This is checking if the grid is empty or not, rather than checking if it has a negative length.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 10 ms (Top 73.55%) | Memory: 62.3 MB (Top 52.61%)
class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;

        int row = grid.length, col = grid[0].length;
        int perimeter = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {

                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    perimeter += 4;

                    if (i > 0 && grid[i - 1][j] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }

                    if (j > 0 && grid[i][j - 1] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }
                }

            }
        }
        return perimeter;
    }
}
```
