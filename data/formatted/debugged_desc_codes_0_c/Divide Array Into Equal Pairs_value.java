There is a bug in the code. The given function `divideArray` checks whether the given array `arr` can be divided into pairs such that each element belongs to exactly one pair and the elements in each pair are equal. However, the current implementation does not actually create any pairs or check for their equality.

To fix this bug, we need to sort the array and then check if consecutive elements are equal. If they are, then the condition for pairing is satisfied.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean divideArray(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 2) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[i + 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
