Bug type:
The bug type in the provided Java code is related to the logic used to compare the numbers in the additive sequence.

Reasoning:
1. The `backtrack` method is being used to recursively check if the given string `num` is an additive number or not.
2. The `currLong` variable is used to construct the current number being considered from the input `num`.
3. There's a comparison logic in place to check if the current number `currLong` is greater than, smaller than, or equal to the sum of the previous two numbers.
4. The `length` variable is used to keep track of the number of elements in the sequence.
5. The `backtrack` method is called recursively to continue checking for more elements in the sequence.

The issue:
The logic in the comparison check is incorrect. The current implementation only compares `sum` and `currLong` without considering the previous numbers in the sequence.

Fix:
1. Modify the comparison logic to correctly compare the previous two numbers with the current `currLong` to check if it forms an additive sequence.

Updated code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {

    public boolean isAdditiveNumber(String num) {
        return backtrack(num, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    }

    public boolean backtrack(String num, int idx, long sum, long prev, int length) {
        if (idx == num.length()) {
            return length >= 3;
        }

        long currLong = 0;

        for (int i = idx; i < num.length(); i++) {
            // Make sure it won't start with 0
            if (i > idx && num.charAt(idx) == '0') break;
            currLong = currLong * 10 + num.charAt(i) - '0';

            if (length >= 2) {
                // Check if current number matches the sum of previous two numbers
                if (sum != currLong) {
                    continue;  // Not a match, try the next number
                }
            }
            // Recursively check for the next number
            if (backtrack(num, i + 1, prev + currLong, currLong, length + 1)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
In the modified code, the comparison logic is updated to check if `sum` matches the `currLong` to continue the sequence. If the comparison is successful, the `backtrack` method is called recursively to check for the next number.

This fix ensures that the previous two numbers in the sequence are correctly compared with the current number to determine if it forms an additive sequence.
