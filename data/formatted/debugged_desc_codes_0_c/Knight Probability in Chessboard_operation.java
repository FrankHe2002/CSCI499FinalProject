Bug type: Logic error

The logic error in the given Java code is that it does not account for the possibility of the knight moving off the chessboard. The "if" condition to check if the next move is within the bounds of the chessboard is incorrect, and the direction array has a typo in the value of "8" after the minus sign.

Here's the fix for the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public double knightProbability(int n, int k, int row, int column) {
        double[][] curr = new double[n][n];
        double[][] next = new double[n][n];

        curr[row][column] = 1;

        int[][] dir = {{-2, 1}, {-1, 2}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, -1}, {1, -2}, {-1, -2}, {-2, -1}};
        for (int p = 1; p <= k; p++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (curr[i][j] != 0) {

                        for (int d = 0; d < 8; d++) {
                            int ni = i + dir[d][0];
                            int nj = j + dir[d][1];

                            if (ni >= 0 && nj >= 0 && ni < n && nj < n) {
                                next[ni][nj] += curr[i][j] / 8.0;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            curr = next;
            next = new double[n][n];
        }

        double sum = 0.0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += curr[i][j];
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```

The bug was fixed by changing the "if" condition to check if the next move is within the bounds of the chessboard. Additionally, the typo in the direction array has been corrected.
