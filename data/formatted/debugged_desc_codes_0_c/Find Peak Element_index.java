The identified bug in the code is that it is using an incorrect variable name `the` instead of `mid` in the condition `if (nums[the] > nums[mid + 1])`. This will cause a compilation error.

To fix the bug, the code must be updated to use the correct variable `mid` in the condition.

Here's the updated code with the bug fix applied:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                // It means that we are in decreasing part of the array
                end = mid;
            } else {
                // It means that we are in increasing part of the array
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```
