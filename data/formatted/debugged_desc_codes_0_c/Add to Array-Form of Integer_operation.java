The buggy line seems to be `k *= num[i];`, as it should be `k += num[i];`. The reasoning process is as follows:

1. The code starts with initializing an ArrayList to store the result.
2. Then it goes through the while loop, iterating through the array `num` from the end to the start or if `k` is still greater than `0`.
3. Inside the loop, there is a condition that checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. If `true`, it multiplies `k` with `num[i]`, which is not the correct operation.
4. Then it adds the remainder of `k` divided by 10 to the result list.
5. Finally, it divides `k` by 10.

The bug is identified as the incorrect operation of multiplication when it should be addition.

The fix is to change line 8 from `k *= num[i];` to `k += num[i];`.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> addToArrayForm(int[] num, int k) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

        int i = num.length;
        while (--i >= 0 || k > 0) {
            if (i >= 0)
                k += num[i];

            res.add(k % 10);
            k /= 10;
        }
        Collections.reverse(res);

        return res;
    }
}
```
