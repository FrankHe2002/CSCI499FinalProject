The given code is intended to find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in the input array. However, the code has a logic bug.

Upon reviewing the code, the issue is identified in the section where the minimum absolute difference is being calculated. The if statement that checks if the current difference is greater than or equal to the minimum difference should actually update the minimum difference if the condition is met.

To fix the bug, the if statement condition should be changed to check if the current difference is less than the minimum difference.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 18 ms (Top 78.7%) | Memory: 55.94 MB (Top 56.9%)

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> minimumAbsDifference(int[] arr) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            int diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1]);
            if (diff < min) { // Fix: Updated the condition to check if the current diff is less than the minimum diff
                min = diff;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            int diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1]);
            if (diff == min) {
                List<Integer> pair = new ArrayList<>(2);
                pair.add(arr[i]);
                pair.add(arr[i + 1]);
                ans.add(pair);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

The bug fix involved updating the condition in the first for loop to compare if the current difference is less than the minimum difference. This will correctly set the minimum difference to the new smaller value.
