The code provided seems to have a bug. The code represents the solution for the problem of calculating the earliest year with the maximum population based on the input logs. The bug in the code may be due to incorrect population count calculations or incorrect logic while finding the earliest year with the maximum population.

To identify the bug and fix it, I would review the code step by step.

1. Review the input constraints to understand the range and limitation of the input data.
2. For the first loop, the code iterates through the 'logs' and updates the 'year' array based on the birth and death years of the person.
3. Review the population count logic in the second loop where the prefix sum is used to calculate the population for each year.
4. Check the conditional logic inside the loop to identify the year with the maximum population.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the bug is mainly due to incorrect population count calculations and the conditional logic for determining the year with the maximum population.

The fix to ensure the correct population count calculations and the conditional logic would be to adjust the second for loop to consider the population of people during each year and update the 'maxYear' accordingly.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumPopulation(int[][] logs) {
        int[] year = new int[2051];
        for (int[] log : logs) {
            year[log[0]] += 1;
            year[log[1]] -= 1;
        }
        int maxNum = year[1950], maxYear = 1950;
    
        for (int i = 1951; i < year.length; i++) {
            year[i] += year[i - 1];
    
            if (year[i] > maxNum) {
                maxNum = year[i];
                maxYear = i;
            }
        }
    
        return maxYear;
    }
}
```

By adjusting the conditional logic and the population count calculations based on the birth and death years, the bug has been fixed.
