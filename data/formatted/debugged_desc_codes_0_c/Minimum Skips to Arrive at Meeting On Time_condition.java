The bug in the code is that the ceil function is not correctly calculating the return value according to the requirements.

The ceil function takes in two integer arguments `n` and `s`, and returns the smallest integer value greater than or equal to `n` when rounded up to the nearest multiple of `s`.

Let's define the requirements and identify the bug:

1. The time it takes to travel each road is calculated by taking the road length and dividing it by the speed.
2. If the travel time is not an integer, the individual must wait until the next integer hour before traveling the next road.
3. However, the individual is allowed to skip some rests to arrive on time.

The ceil function is supposed to calculate the time needed to travel a specific distance, then wait until the next integer hour. However, the function does not correctly calculate the waiting time.

The equation inside the ceil function is incorrect. The goal is to calculate the time to the next integer hour after traveling the distance, taking into consideration the speed and the time already spent traveling. The correct equation to calculate the time to the next integer hour is `(s - n % s) % s`, which accounts for the time already spent traveling.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 41 ms (Top 92.86%) | Memory: 43.4 MB (Top 57.14%)
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minSkips(int[] dist, int speed, int hoursBefore) {
        int N = dist.length, INF = (int) 1e9;
        int[] dp = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(dp, INF);
        dp[0] = 0; // before we start, we have a time of 0 for 0 cost
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--) { // j (cost) is at most i (num of element-1) so we start from there.
                dp[j] = Math.min(j == 0 ? INF : dp[j - 1] + dist[i], ceil(dp[j], speed) + dist[i]);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { // find the min cost (i) such that the min time is no greater than hoursBefore
            if (ceil(dp[i], speed) / speed >= hoursBefore) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    private int ceil(int n, int s) {
        return n + (s - n % s) % s;
    }
}
