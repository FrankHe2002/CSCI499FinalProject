The given Java code is intended to check whether a binary tree is symmetric around its center. The code uses a recursive approach to compare the left and right subtrees of the given tree to determine if they are symmetrical.

Upon reviewing the code, the logic seems to be correct. However, one issue that can be identified is the method invocation in the `isSymmetric` method. 

The recursive calls to `isSymmetric` should be made on `rootLeft` and `rootRight`, swapped, i.e., `rootLeft.left, rootRight.right` and `rootLeft.right, rootRight.left` instead of `rootLeft.right, rootRight.left` and `rootLeft.left, rootRight.right`. This is because for a tree to be symmetric, the left subtree of the left child should be equal to the right subtree of the right child.

Below is the modified code with the fix:

```java

class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        return isSymmetric(root.left, root.right);
    }

    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode rootLeft, TreeNode rootRight) {
        if (rootLeft == null && rootRight == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (rootLeft == null || rootRight == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (rootLeft.val != rootRight.val) {
            return false;
        } else
            return isSymmetric(rootLeft.left, rootRight.right) && isSymmetric(rootLeft.right, rootRight.left); //fixed the method invocation
    }
}
```
