The code provided seems to have a logic bug. The code is trying to iterate through the string `s` from the end and count the length of the last word encountered. The issue lies within the while loop conditions and flag logic.

The main issue is the condition inside the while loop. It should be checking for characters and spaces, but it is not properly handling that. Additionally, the flag logic seems overly complicated.

To fix this bug, we can simplify the while loop condition and remove the flag logic entirely. We can iterate from the end of the string and count the characters until we encounter a space or reach the beginning of the string.

Here's the modified code with bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int len = 0;
        int j = s.length() - 1;

        // Skip trailing spaces
        while (j >= 0 && s.charAt(j) == ' ') {
            j--;
        }

        // Count length of last word
        while (j >= 0 && s.charAt(j) != ' ') {
            len++;
            j--;
        }

        return len;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- I have removed the flag variable and the complex condition inside the while loop.
- I added a loop to skip any trailing spaces at the end of the string.
- Then, I used another loop to count the length of the last word encountered from the end of the string.

This should fix the bug and provide the correct length of the last word in the string.
