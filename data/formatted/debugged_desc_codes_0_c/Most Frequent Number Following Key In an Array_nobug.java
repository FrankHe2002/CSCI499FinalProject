The code appears to contain a logic bug. The issue seems to arise from not counting the occurrences of the target immediately following an occurrence of the key properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the first for loop to loop through the array until the second to last element (i < n - 1) and include the last element in the count of targets following the key.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 55.1%) | Memory: 43.05 MB (Top 60.9%)

import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int mostFrequent(int[] nums, int key) {
        int n = nums.length;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i < n - 1 && nums[i] == key) {
                int target = nums[i + 1];
                map.put(target, map.getOrDefault(target, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        int max = 0;
        int re = 0;
        for (int x : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.get(x) > max) {
                re = x;
                max = map.get(x);
            }
        }
        return re;
    }
}
```
