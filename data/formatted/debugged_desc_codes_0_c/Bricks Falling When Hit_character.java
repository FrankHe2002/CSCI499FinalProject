Bug type: Logical error

The code has a logical error when checking the stability of bricks after a hit is made. When marking the brick as 1 after a hit and checking for stability, the code should also check if this brick is directly connected to the top of the grid. It misses that condition.

Additionally, there is a typo when creating the `dirs` array.

Here's the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    int[][] dirs = new int[][] {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

    public int[] hitBricks(int[][] grid, int[][] hits) {
        // ... (same as the original code)

        for (int i = hits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int row = hits[i][0];
            int col = hits[i][1];

            if (grid[row][col] == 0) {
                res[i] = 0;
                continue;
            }

            grid[row][col] = 0;
            if (!isStable(grid, row, col)) {
                res[i] = 0;
                continue;
            }

            res[i] = markAndCountStableBricks(grid, row, col) - 1;
        }

        return res;
    }

    // ... (same as the original code)
}
```
