The provided code seems to have a bug. The for loop condition in line 17 appears to be incorrect, and it results in an infinite loop. Let's update the loop condition, and fix any further issues related to the for loop.

Here's the fix for the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public long gridGame(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid[0].length;
        long preRow1[] = new long[n];
        long preRow2[] = new long[n];

        preRow1[0] = grid[0][0];
        preRow2[0] = grid[1][0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            preRow1[i] += (long) preRow1[i - 1] + (long) grid[0][i];
            preRow2[i] += (long) preRow2[i - 1] + (long) grid[1][i];
        }

        long res = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  // <-- Updated the loop condition
            long top = preRow1[n - 1] - preRow1[i];
            long bottom = i == 0 ? 0 : preRow2[i - 1];
            long temp = Math.max(top, bottom);
            res = Math.min(res, temp);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- Upon reviewing the provided code, it's clear that the condition `i >= n` in the for loop (line 17) is incorrect. This condition results in an infinite loop because `i` will never be greater than or equal to `n`.
- The condition should be updated to `i < n` to iterate from 0 to n-1.
- With the fixed loop condition, the code should work as expected, and the bug is resolved.
