The code logic seems to be correct based on the problem description. However, the code has the potential risk of an infinite loop when trying to calculate the `power` method with large values of `n`. This could lead to a stack overflow error.

To fix this potential issue, the `power` method can be optimized by using an iterative approach to calculate the power of a number modulo another number.

Here's the refactored code with the optimized `power` method:

```java
class Solution {
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;

    public int countGoodNumbers(long n) {
        long first = (n % 2 == 0 ? (n / 2) : (n / 2) + 1);
        long second = n / 2;
        long mul1 = fastPower(5, first) % mod;
        long mul2 = fastPower(4, second) % mod;
        long ans = 1;
        ans = (ans * mul1) % mod;
        ans = (second == 0) ? (ans * mul2) % mod : ans;
        return (int) (ans % mod);
    }

    public long fastPower(long x, long y) {
        long result = 1;
        while (y > 0) {
            if (y % 2 == 1) {
                result = (result * x) % mod;
            }
            y = y >> 1;
            x = (x * x) % mod;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
