Bug Type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code seems to be the right overall design for the snake's movement. It creates a queue and a hash set to track the positions the snake has taken, using a custom position class and methods for possible moves depending on the configuration.
2. When analyzing closely, the conditions used to check if the next move is possible seem to be flawed.
3. Conditions such as checking the availability of future cells to move to are correct but the position check, whether the cell is empty, seems to use the same grid cell to move into.

Fix:
The existing condition checking for whether a cell is empty seems to use the same cell while trying to move to free positions. It should use different cells for checking, as in the same cell is used then that will always be empty.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(int[][] grid) {

        int n = grid.length;
        Set<Position> set = new HashSet<>();

        Queue<Position> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(new Position(0, 0, 0, 1));
        int count = 0;

        if (grid[n - 1][n - 2] == 1 || grid[n - 1][n - 1] == 1)
            return -1;

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            ++count;
            Queue<Position> nextq = new LinkedList<>();
            while (!q.isEmpty()) {

                Position p = q.poll();
                int r1 = p.getr1();
                int r2 = p.getr2();
                int c1 = p.getc1();
                int c2 = p.getc2();

                if (r1 == n - 1 && r2 == n - 1 && c1 == n - 2 && c2 == n - 1)
                    return count - 1;

                if (set.contains(p))
                    continue;

                if (c1 + 1 < n && grid[r1][c1 + 1] != 1 && grid[r2][c2 + 1] != 1)  // Corrected this condition
                    nextq.offer(new Position(r1, c1 + 1, r2, c2 + 1));
                if (r1 + 1 < n && grid[r1 + 1][c1] != 1 && grid[r2 + 1][c2] != 1)  // Corrected this condition
                    nextq.offer(new Position(r1 + 1, c1, r2 + 1, c2));

                if (r1 == r2 && r1 + 1 < n && r2 + 1 < n && grid[r1 + 1][c1] == 0 && grid[r2 + 1][c2] == 0)
                    nextq.offer(new Position(r1, c1, r1 + 1, c1));
                if (c1 == c2 && c1 + 1 < n && c2 + 1 < n && grid[r1][c1 + 1] == 0 && grid[r2][c1 + 1] == 0)
                    nextq.offer(new Position(r1, c1, r1, c1 + 1));
                set.add(p);
            }
            q = nextq;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    private class Position {
        int r1;
        int c1;
        int r2;
        int c2;
        // Existing methods

		// Existing methods remain the same without any changes
    }
