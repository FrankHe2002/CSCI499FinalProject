The bug in the provided Java code is a syntax error. The array initialization in the line `int[] res = new int[seq.length)];` has an extra closing square bracket "]" after `seq.length()`. This will result in a compilation error, preventing the code from running.

To fix this issue, simply remove the extra closing square bracket "]" in the line `int[] res = new int[seq.length)];` to make it `int[] res = new int[seq.length];`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxDepthAfterSplit(String seq) {
        int[] res = new int[seq.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < seq.length(); i++) {
            res[i] = seq.charAt(i) == '(' ? i & 1 : 1 - i & 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
