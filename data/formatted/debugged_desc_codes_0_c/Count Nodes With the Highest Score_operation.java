The given code calculates the number of nodes that have the highest score in a binary tree. 

The code appears to be logically correct, but there is a potential bug in the `dfs()` method. The bug exists in the line `mult *= (s == 0 ? 1L : n + sum);`. This multiplication logic should be executed only if `s` is not equal to 0.

To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if `s` is not equal to 0 before performing the multiplication.

Here's the revised code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    long max = 0, res = 0;

    public int countHighestScoreNodes(int[] parents) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> hm = new HashMap();
        for (int i = 0; i < parents.length; i++) {   // build the tree
            hm.computeIfAbsent(parents[i], x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
        }
        dfs(0, parents.length, hm); // traverse the tree to get the result
        return (int) res;
    }

    int dfs(int s, int n, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> hm) {
        int sum = 1;
        long mult = 1L;
        for (int child : hm.getOrDefault(s, new ArrayList<>())) {
            int count = dfs(child, n, hm); // subtree node count
            sum += count;
            mult *= count; // multiply the result by children size
        }
        if (s != 0) { // check if s is not equal to 0
            mult *= (n + sum); // multiply the result by remain size except self and children size(the nodes through parent)
        }
        if (mult > max) {
            max = mult;
            res = 1;
        } else if (mult == max) {
            res++;
        }
        return sum; // return the node count of the tree rooted at s
    }
}
```

I've added a condition `if (s != 0)` before the multiplication statement to ensure that the multiplication is only performed when `s` is not equal to 0. This should fix the bug.
