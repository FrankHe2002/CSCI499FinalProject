There is a bug in the code where the logic for pushing matching closing brackets onto the stack is incorrect. Additionally, the if conditions for checking the opening characters are incorrect.

Here's the step-by-step process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The logic for pushing matching closing brackets onto the stack is incorrect. We need to check for opening brackets and push their corresponding closing brackets onto the stack.
2. The if conditions for checking the opening characters are also incorrect.

Here's the fix for the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>(); // create an empty stack
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) { // loop through each character in the string
            if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[') { // if the character is an opening parenthesis, brace, or bracket
                stack.push(c); // push the opening bracket onto the stack
            } else {
                if (stack.isEmpty()) { // if the stack is empty
                    return false; // there is no matching opening bracket, so the string is not valid
                }
                char opening = stack.pop(); // pop the top of the stack
                if ((c == ')' && opening != '(') || (c == '}' && opening != '{') || (c == ']' && opening != '[')) {
                    return false; // if the opening bracket does not match the corresponding closing bracket, the string is not valid
                }
            }
        }
        // if the stack is empty, all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets,
        // so the string is valid, otherwise, there are unmatched opening brackets, so return false
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

In this fixed code:
1. When encountering an opening parenthesis, brace, or bracket, we correctly push the opening bracket onto the stack.
2. When encountering a closing parenthesis, brace, or bracket, we check if the stack is empty, and then pop the top of the stack to match it with the closing bracket. If they don't match, the string is not valid.

This should resolve the bug in the original code.
