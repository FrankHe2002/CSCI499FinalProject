Bug Type: Logical Error

The logic of the code does not seem to be following the correct approach for finding the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three. The current implementation is using an incorrect approach for dealing with the conditions and updating the values of `r0`, `r1`, and `r2`.

To fix this logic issue, we can simplify the conditions and updates while still ensuring that the maximum possible sum of elements is returned.

Here's the updated code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {

    public int maxSumDivThree(int[] nums) {
        int r0 = 0;
        int r1 = 0;
        int r2 = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int nr0 = r0, nr1 = r1, nr2 = r2;
            if (num % 3 == 0) {
                nr0 = Math.max(nr0, r0 + num);
                nr1 = Math.max(nr1, r1 + num);
                nr2 = Math.max(nr2, r2 + num);
            } else if (num % 3 == 1) {
                nr0 = Math.max(nr0, r2 + num);
                nr1 = Math.max(nr1, r0 + num);
                nr2 = Math.max(nr2, r1 + num);
            } else if (num % 3 == 2) {
                nr0 = Math.max(nr0, r1 + num);
                nr1 = Math.max(nr1, r2 + num);
                nr2 = Math.max(nr2, r0 + num);
            }
            r0 = nr0;
            r1 = nr1;
            r2 = nr2;
        }

        return r0;
    }
}
```

In this fix, we iterate through the array and update `r0`, `r1`, and `r2` based on the current element of the array, considering the different remainders when divided by 3. The new approach correctly handles the conditions and updates to find the maximum sum divisible by three.
