The code contains multiple issues. 

First, let's identify the bug in the `getMinSwaps` method that calculates the minimum number of adjacent digit swaps.

One of the main issues in the `getMinSwaps` method is that it is using `nums` which gets modified in the `nextPermutation` method. This is incorrect because the `nextPermutation` method works based on the `org` array and the `nums` array should not be changed after it's initialized. 

The `nextPermutation` method should work on a copy of the original array in order to correctly identify the k-th smallest wonderful integer and avoid interference with the `org` array calculation.

Lastly, the name `'numsi'` within this method should be `'nums[i]'`.

Here's the fixed and improved code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int getMinSwaps(String num, int k) {
        int[] nums = new int[num.length()];
        int[] org = new int[num.length()];

        for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); i++) {
            int e = Character.getNumericValue(num.charAt(i));
            nums[i] = e;
            org[i] = e;
        }

        int[] temp = nums.clone(); // Create a copy to avoid modifying the original array
        while (k != 0) {
            nextPermutation(temp); // Use the temporary copy
            k--;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (temp[i] != org[i]) {
                int j = 0;
                for (j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                    if (org[j] == temp[i]) {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                while (j > 0 && j != i) {
                    swap(org, j, j - 1);
                    ans++;
                    j--;
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    // Rest of the code remains as is
    // The nextPermutation, swap, and reverse methods remain unchanged.
}
```

After making the mentioned changes to the code, it will have the same functionality but without the bugs previously identified.
