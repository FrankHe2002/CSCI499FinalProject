There seems to be a bug in the code that is preventing it from correctly finding the intersection of the two arrays. Upon careful inspection, it looks like the bug is in the logic of checking for intersection.

The if statement `if (dp[i] == 0)` is checking if the current element in nums2 is not present in nums1, and if so, it's adding it to the ans array. This logic should be reversed. We should be adding the element to the ans array if it is present in nums1.

To fix this bug, the if statement condition should be changed to check if the element is present in nums1. Additionally, the condition `dp[i] = 0;` should be removed, as it doesn't seem to serve any purpose.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int[] dp = new int[1001];
        for (int i : nums1) {
            dp[i]++;
        }
        int[] ans = new int[1000];

        int ptr = 0;
        for (int i : nums2) {
            if (dp[i] > 0) {
                ans[ptr] = i;
                ptr++;
                dp[i] = 0; // resetting the count in dp
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(ans, 0, ptr);
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, we correctly check if an element from nums2 is present in nums1 before adding it to the ans array. We also reset the count in dp for the element that is added to ans to ensure uniqueness.
