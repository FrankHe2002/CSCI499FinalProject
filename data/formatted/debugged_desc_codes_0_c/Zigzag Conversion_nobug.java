Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
The code is trying to create the zigzag pattern by traversing the string and adding characters to a StringBuilder based on the row number. However, the logic inside the for loop and while loop is incorrect and doesn't produce the correct zigzag pattern output.

1. The for loop should go from 0 to numRows - 1, not 1 to numRows.
2. The logic inside the while loop for updating the index is incorrect.
3. The if-else conditions for updating the index during traversal are not producing the correct zigzag pattern.

To fix the logical error, we need to update the traversal logic inside the for loop and while loop to correctly produce the zigzag pattern.

Code with minimal changes:
```java
class Solution {
    public String convert(String s, int numRows) {
        if (numRows == 1) return s;
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
            int ind = i;
            boolean up = true;
            while (ind < s.length()) {
                builder.append(s.charAt(ind));
                if (i == 0 || i == numRows - 1) {
                    ind += 2 * (numRows - 1);
                } else {
                    ind += up ? 2 * (numRows - i - 1) : 2 * i;
                    up = !up;
                }
            }
        }
        return builder.toString();
    }
}
```
