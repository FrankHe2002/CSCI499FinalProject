The code logic seems to be correct, but there can be a potential bug on the comparison logic within the while loop.

The logic inside the while loop is checking if the totalSum + k is greater than or equal to the window size * nums[R]. However, the comparison should be the other way around to check if the window size * nums[R] is greater than or equal to totalSum + k.

Let's make the necessary changes inside the while loop and then test the code.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int L = 0, R = 0;
        long totalSum = 0;
        int res = 1;
        
        while (R < nums.length) {
            totalSum += nums[R];
            while (((R - L + 1) * nums[R]) > (totalSum + k)) {
                totalSum -= nums[L];
                L++;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, (R - L + 1));
            R++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The comparison in the while loop condition was changed. Now the code should work as intended without the potential bug.
