There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the predictTheWinner method where the array nums is not correctly referenced, and there is a missing comma in the method signature.

To fix this bug, the method signature should include a comma between the data types of the method parameters, and the reference to the nums array should be corrected.

Additionally, there is a logical bug in the predictTheWinner method where the conditions for updating the scores and the recursive calls are incorrect.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
        return predictTheWinner(nums, 0, nums.length - 1, true, 0, 0);
    }

    private boolean predictTheWinner(int[] nums, int start, int end, boolean isP1Turn, long p1Score, long p2Score) {
        if (start > end) {
            return p1Score >= p2Score;
        }

        boolean firstTry;
        boolean secondTry;
        if (isP1Turn) {
            firstTry = predictTheWinner(nums, start + 1, end, false, p1Score + nums[start], p2Score);
            secondTry = predictTheWinner(nums, start, end - 1, false, p1Score + nums[end], p2Score);

        } else {
            firstTry = predictTheWinner(nums, start + 1, end, true, p1Score, p2Score + nums[start]);
            secondTry = predictTheWinner(nums, start, end - 1, true, p1Score, p2Score + nums[end]);

        }
        return isP1Turn ? Math.max(firstTry, secondTry) : Math.min(firstTry, secondTry);
    }
}
```

In this correction, I fixed the array reference and added a comma between the data types in the method signature. I also updated the logic to calculate the maximum score for player 1 and minimum score for player 2.
