The bug in the code is in the for loop where the value of the current income bracket is being incorrectly decremented. Additionally, the loop is breaking early if the remaining income is greater than 0, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update how the current income bracket value is calculated and remove the break statement to fix the incorrect early termination of the loop.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double calculateTax(int[][] brackets, int income) {
        double ans = 0;
        int remainingIncome = income;
        int pre = 0;
        for (int[] arr : brackets) {
            int currentIncome = Math.min(remainingIncome, arr[0] - pre);
            ans += (double) (currentIncome * arr[1]) / 100;
            remainingIncome -= currentIncome;
            pre = arr[0];
            if (remainingIncome <= 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
