Bug Type:
Logical error

The code calculates the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor in a cubic storeroom, but it seems to have a logical error where the calculations may not align with the rules for placing the boxes.

Fix:
To identify and fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Read and understand the problem description and the given code to understand the expected behavior.
2. Analyze the mathematical calculations performed in the code to ensure they align with the rules for placing the boxes.
3. Evaluate the conditions and constraints specified in the problem to verify that they are correctly considered in the code.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it seems that the code may not accurately calculate the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor based on the given rules and constraints.
To fix the logical error, we need to modify the algorithm for determining the minimum number of boxes touching the floor using the given rules.

Based on the problem description, the cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to n units, and we need to place n boxes in this room such that if box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        // Calculate the maximum height of a pyramid that can fit the given number of boxes
        // This directly represents the minimum number of boxes touching the floor
        int height = (int) Math.ceil((-1 + Math.sqrt(1 + 8 * n)) / 2);
        
        // Calculate the total number of boxes needed to reach the maximum height (pyramid)
        int totalBoxes = height * (height + 1) * (height + 2) / 6;
        
        // Calculate the remaining boxes that need to be placed as per the rules
        int remainingBoxes = n - totalBoxes;
        
        // Calculate the additional boxes needed to form a lower level of the pyramid to satisfy the rules
        int extraBoxes = (int) Math.ceil((-1 + Math.sqrt(1 + 8 * remainingBoxes)) / 2);
        
        // Calculate the minimum number of boxes touching the floor
        return totalBoxes + extraBoxes;
    }
}
```

The fixed code uses a simplified algorithm to calculate the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor based on the given rules and constraints. It directly calculates the height of the pyramid that can accommodate the given number of boxes and then uses the formula to calculate the minimum number of boxes touching the floor.
