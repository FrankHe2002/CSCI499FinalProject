Bug type: Logical Error

The bug in the code seems to be a logical error related to the method to calculate the maximum score that Alice can obtain. I will review and debug the code step by step.

1. The `fnc` method seems to be using a recursive approach to calculate the maximum score, and it uses a 2D array `dp` for memoization.
2. It calculates the sum of the stone values and then recursively tries to divide the stone array into two non-empty rows and calculates the maximum score for Alice.
3. The logic inside the for loop to compare the two rows and calculate the maximum score seems to be incorrect.

I will fix the bug by re-implementing the `fnc` method to properly calculate the maximum score for Alice.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    int[][] dp;

    public int fnc(int[] a, int[] prefixSum, int i, int j) {
        if (i >= j)
            return 0;
        if (dp[i][j] != 0)
            return dp[i][j];

        int ans = 0;
        int total = prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[i];
        for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
            int leftSum = prefixSum[k + 1] - prefixSum[i];
            int rightSum = total - leftSum;
            if (leftSum <= rightSum) {
                ans = Math.max(ans, leftSum + fnc(a, prefixSum, i, k));
            }
            if (rightSum <= leftSum) {
                ans = Math.max(ans, rightSum + fnc(a, prefixSum, k + 1, j));
            }
        }
        dp[i][j] = ans;
        return dp[i][j];
    }

    public int stoneGameV(int[] stoneValue) {
        int n = stoneValue.length;
        
        int[] prefixSum = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + stoneValue[i];
        }

        dp = new int[n][n];
        return fnc(stoneValue, prefixSum, 0, n - 1);
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, I updated the `fnc` method to properly calculate the maximum score and introduced `prefixSum` to avoid repetitive calculation of sums. The bug has been fixed using minimal changes.
