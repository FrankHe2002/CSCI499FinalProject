The original code uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of subarrays and check if the sum is divisible by 'k'. However, there is a bug in the recursive 'help' method, which does not update the value of the 't' array, leading to incorrect results.

The fixed code uses an iterative approach along with a HashMap to solve the problem more effectively. When using an iterative approach, it allows us to store the index in the map as a key and the index itself as a value to keep track of the subarray sum's remainder when divided by 'k'.

The updated code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean checkSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(-1, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            sum = k == 0 ? sum : sum % k;
            if (map.containsKey(sum) && i - map.get(sum) >= 2) {
                return true;
            }
            map.putIfAbsent(sum, i);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
