There is a bug in the given code. The bug is in the logic of finding the second maximum value in the array.

To fix the bug, the following steps should be taken:
1. Initialize `max` and `smax` with -1.
2. Iterate over the `nums` array and compare the current value with the current maximum and second maximum.
3. If the current value is greater than the current maximum, update both the maximum and second maximum. If it is only greater than the second maximum, update the second maximum.
4. Finally, check if the largest element is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element; otherwise, return -1.

Here is the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int dominantIndex(int[] nums) {
        int max = -1;
        int smax = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (max == -1 || nums[i] > nums[max]) {
                smax = max;
                max = i;
            } else if (smax == -1 || nums[i] > nums[smax]) {
                smax = i;
            }
        }

        if (smax == -1 || nums[max] >= 2 * nums[smax]) {
            return max;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
