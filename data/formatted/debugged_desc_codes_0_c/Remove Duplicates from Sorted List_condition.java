The given code seems to be using the correct approach to remove duplicates from a sorted linked list. It iterates through the list and compares current value with the next value, removing the next node if they are the same.

However, there is a logical error in the code. In the else block, when the values are the same, it should be the duplicates that get removed, not the unique values. Also, the final result returned should be the updated 'result' list, not the original 'head' list.

The fix involves correctly manipulating the 'next' pointers and returning 'result' at the end.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {

        if (head == null) {
            return head;
        }

        ListNode result = head;

        while (result != null) {
            if (result.next == null) {
                break;
            }

            if (result.val == result.next.val) {
                result.next = result.next.next;
            } else {
                result = result.next;
            }
        }

        return head;
    }
}
```
