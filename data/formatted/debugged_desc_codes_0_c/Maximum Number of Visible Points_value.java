The given code is intended to calculate the maximum number of points visible within the given angle from the given location. The algorithm identifies the angle between each point and the given location and checks if it falls within the allowed field of view angle.

Potential Bug:
In the angle calculation method, the logic for returning a positive value if the angle is negative seems incorrect, specifically `return (a < 0 ? a + -1 : a)` This logic might be causing incorrect angle calculations, leading to incorrect visibility calculations.

Here's the step-by-step process to diagnose, fix, and apply the changes:

Diagnosis:
1. The angle calculation logic `return (a < 0 ? a + -1 : a)` seems incorrect. It should return the positive value of the angle if it is negative, not subtract 1.
2. Additionally, the calculation involving edge cases for angle comparison seems to be unnecessarily complex.

Fix and Apply Changes:
Here's the corrected code with minimal changes:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int visiblePoints(List<List<Integer>> points, int angle, List<Integer> location) {
        int overlap = 0;
        List<Double> list = new ArrayList<>(points.size());
        for (List<Integer> p : points) {
            if (p.get(0) == location.get(0) && p.get(1) == location.get(1)) {
                overlap++;
            } else {
                list.add(angle(p.get(1) - location.get(1), p.get(0) - location.get(0)));
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(list);
        int max = 0;
        int n = list.size();
        int i2 = 0;

        for (int i1 = 0; i1 < n; i1++) {
            while (i2 < n && list.get(i2) - list.get(i1) <= angle) {
                i2++;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, i2 - i1);
        }
        return max + overlap;
    }

    private double angle(int dy, int dx) {
        double a = Math.toDegrees(Math.atan2(dy, dx));
        return a < 0 ? a + 360 : a;
    }
}
```

In the `angle` method:
- Changed the return statement to return positive value if the calculated angle is negative by adding 360, ensuring the angle is always positive.

In the `visiblePoints` method:
- Removed the complex edge case handling for angle comparison.
- Adjusted the loop condition to correctly find the maximum visibility range for each angle.

These changes should address the potential bug and provide correct visibility calculations.
