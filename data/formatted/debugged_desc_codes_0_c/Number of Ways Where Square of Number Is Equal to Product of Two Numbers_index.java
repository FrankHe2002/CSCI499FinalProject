The given Java code contains some issues. Let's review and identify the bug type by analyzing and fixing the code step by step.

Bug Type:
1. Logical Error: In the count method, the variable jNew is being referenced before it is declared, and the multiplication between the count of jNew - j and k - kNew will not be giving the desired result. 
2. Compilation Error: The variable jNew is being accessed before it is declared. This will result in a compilation error.

Fixing the Bug:
- Declare the jNew variable before accessing it to fix the compilation error.
- Fix the logical error by moving the declaration of jNew before it is accessed.

The modified code with the fixes is shown below:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
class Solution {
    public int numTriplets(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
        Arrays.sort(nums2);
        return count(nums1, nums2) + count(nums2, nums1);
    }
  
    public int count(int a[], int b[]) {
        int n = a.length;
        int m = b.length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long x = (long) a[i] * a[i]; // Fixed to use i instead of wrong variable jNew
            int j = 0;
            int k = m - 1;
            while (j < k) {
                long prod = (long) b[j] * b[k];
                if (prod < x)
                    j++;
                else if (prod > x)
                    k--;
                else if (b[j] != b[k]) {
                    int jNew = j;
                    int kNew = k;

                    while (b[j] == b[jNew])
                        jNew++;
                    while (b[k] == b[kNew])
                        kNew--;
                    count += (jNew - j) * (k - kNew);
                    j = jNew;
                    k = kNew;
                } else {
                    int q = k - j + 1;
                    count += (q) * (q - 1) / 2;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

The bugs have been fixed in the given Java code by making minimal changes. The logical error has been fixed by using the variable i instead of the incorrect variable jNew. The compilation error has been fixed by declaring the variable jNew before accessing it.
