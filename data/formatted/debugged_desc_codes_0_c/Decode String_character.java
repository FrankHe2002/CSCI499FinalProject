The code has a few logical issues, which need to be addressed:
- The section where the number of times to repeat 'n' is calculated has issues.
- The update of the value of 'n' needs to be corrected.
- The substring for the repeated string 'insert' and remainder of the string 'end' is incorrect.
- There are incorrect parentheses and index calculations used in between various parts of the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String decodeString(String s) {

        int bb = s.indexOf('[');
        int eb;
        int n, nl;
        char nd;
        String insert, end;

        while (bb != -1) {
            eb = bb;
            while (s.charAt(eb) != ']') {
                eb++;
            }
            n = 0;
            nl = 0;
            while (bb - nl >= 0) {
                nd = s.charAt(bb - nl - 1);
                if (Character.isDigit(nd)) {
                    n = n + (nd - '0') * (int) Math.pow(10, nl);
                    nl++;
                } else {
                    break;
                }

            }

            insert = s.substring(bb + 1, eb);
            end = s.substring(eb + 1);
            s = s.substring(0, bb - nl);

            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                s += insert;
            }
            s += end;

            bb = s.indexOf('[');
        }
        return s;
    }
}
