The bug in the provided code is in the `dfs` method in the `if` statement where it checks for fuel remaining. The condition is checking if `fuel` is greater than or equal to 0, but it should be the opposite since we want to continue if there is fuel left. Also, the `dfs` method should handle the condition where the fuel becomes negative and return 0 in that case.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {

    int mod = (int) Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;
    int[][] dp;

    public int countRoutes(int[] locations, int start, int finish, int fuel) {

        dp = new int[locations.length][fuel + 1];

        for (int[] row : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, - 1);
        }

        return dfs(locations, start, finish, fuel);
    }

    public int dfs(int[] locations, int cur_location, int finish, int fuel) {
        if (fuel < 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (dp[cur_location][fuel] != - 1) {
            return dp[cur_location][fuel];
        }

        int result = 0;

        if (cur_location == finish) {
            result++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < locations.length; i++) {

            if (i == cur_location) continue;

            int fuel_cost = Math.abs(locations[i] - locations[cur_location]);
            int next_trip = dfs(locations, i, finish, fuel - fuel_cost);
            result += next_trip;
            result %= mod;
        }

        dp[cur_location][fuel] = result;

        return dp[cur_location][fuel];
    }
}
```
