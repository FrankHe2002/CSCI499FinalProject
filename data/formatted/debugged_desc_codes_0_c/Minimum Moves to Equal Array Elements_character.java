The bug in the code is that the return statement is outside of the method `minMoves`. This causes a compilation error, as the method doesn't have a return statement.

To fix the bug, we need to move the return statement inside the `minMoves` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i : nums)
            min = Math.min(i, min);

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            count += nums[i] - min;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
