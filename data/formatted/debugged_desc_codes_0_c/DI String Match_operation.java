Bug type:
1. Index out of bounds error.
2. Array initialization issue.

Identifying and fixing the bugs:
1. The code initializes the `ans` array with a length of `s.length() - 1`, which is incorrect according to the problem requirement and will lead to an index out of bounds error. It should be initialized with a length of `s.length() + 1`.
2. The `ans[s.length()] = high` statement in the code will also cause an index out of bounds error because the array `ans` was initialized with a length of `s.length() - 1`, so the maximum index should be `s.length() - 2`. This should be fixed to `ans[s.length() - 1] = high`.

Code with minimal changes:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] diStringMatch(String s) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = s.length();
        int[] ans = new int[s.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'I') {
                ans[i] = low++;
            } else {
                ans[i] = high--;
            }
        }
        ans[s.length()] = high;
        return ans;
    }
}
```
