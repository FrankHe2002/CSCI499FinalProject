The bug in the provided code is in the split method where the right value is incorrect.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The split method is used to check if it is possible to form a palindrome string by splitting 'a' and 'b' at the same index.
2. The bug is in the line `int left = 0, right = a.length() - 0;` where right is incorrectly calculated as `a.length() - 0`. It should be `int left = 0, right = a.length() - 1;` to represent the correct index.
3. Additionally, in the isPalindrome method, the condition should be `while (left < right)` instead of `while (left <= right)` to avoid comparing the middle character twice.

Here's the fixed code without making any other changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPalindromeFormation(String a, String b) {
        return split(a, b) || split(b, a);
    }

    private boolean split(String a, String b) {
        int left = 0, right = a.length() - 1;
        while (left < right && a.charAt(left) == b.charAt(right)) {
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        if (left >= right) return true;
        return isPalindrome(a, left, right) || isPalindrome(b, left, right);
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

The bug is fixed by correcting the indices in the split method and isPalindrome method as described, without reorganizing or optimizing the code.
