The provided Java code has a bug in the `deleteDuplicates` method. The bug is that instead of deleting the duplicate nodes, the code is only removing duplicates from the array, and then incorrectly updating the values of the linked list without removing any duplicates.

To fix the bug, I will follow these steps:
1. Traverse the linked list, and remove the duplicate nodes by setting the `next` pointers appropriately.
2. Update the values of the linked list to contain only distinct numbers.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 8.62% | Memory: 43.1 MB (Top 83.93%)
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy;
        ListNode current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            while (current.next != null && current.val == current.next.val) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            if (prev.next == current) {
                prev = prev.next;
            } else {
                prev.next = current.next;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

The reasoning behind the fix:
1. Create a `dummy` node and point its `next` to the `head` of the linked list. This will help handle the case where the `head` itself is a duplicate.
2. Use two pointers `prev` and `current` to iterate through the list.
3. While iterating, if a duplicate is found, skip all duplicates and finally fix the `next` pointers to remove all the duplicates.
4. Return the `dummy.next` as the new head of the linked list containing only distinct numbers.
