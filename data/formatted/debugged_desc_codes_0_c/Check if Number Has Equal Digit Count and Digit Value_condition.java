Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code defines an array `freqArr` of size 10 to store the frequency count of digits.
2. In the first loop, it updates the frequency of each digit in num.
3. In the second loop, it updates a variable `freq` to the frequency of the digit at index `i` and then subtracts it from `freqArr[i]`, which is logically incorrect.
4. The third loop has the wrong condition `i >= 10` which will cause the loop to never execute as `i` starts from 0 and will never be greater than or equal to 10.

Fix:
1. Calculate the frequency of each digit from the string `num`.
2. Compare the calculated frequency with the frequency stored in the freqArr array at the index corresponding to each digit.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean digitCount(String num) {
        int[] freqArr = new int[10];  // n = 10 given in constraints;
        int n = num.length();

        for (char digit : num.toCharArray()) {
            freqArr[digit - '0']++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int freq = freqArr[num.charAt(i) - '0'];  // freq of each digit in the string
            if (freq == 0 || freq != num.charAt(i) - '0') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
In the updated code, I fixed the logical error by comparing the calculated frequency with the frequency stored in `freqArr`. I also fixed the loop condition to iterate from 0 to n, and used proper array indexing.
