The code seems to be straightforward, calculating the count of odd numbers between the given range. However, there is a bug in the logic.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the logic is incorrectly counting the odd numbers when both low and high are even.

To fix the bug, we can change the condition in the if statement to check for low % 2 != 0 instead of low % 2 == 0.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        if (low % 2 != 0 && high % 2 != 0) {
            return (high - low) / 2 + 1;
        }
        return (high - low) / 2;
    }
}
```

In this fix, we changed the condition in the if statement to check for low % 2 != 0 instead of low % 2 == 0. This change ensures that when both low and high are even, the count of odd numbers is calculated correctly.
