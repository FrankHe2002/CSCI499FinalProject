The given code attempts to solve the "Excavation" problem using a brute-force approach. It uses a nested for loop to check if the cells of each artifact are present in the set of cells to be excavated. If all the cells of an artifact are present in the excavation set, the count of discovered artifacts is incremented.

However, the bug in the code lies in the condition `if (! set.contains(i + " " + j)) done = false;`. The problem is that when converting integer `i + " " + j` to a string, it does not preserve the original values. An additional issue is that the condition inside the inner loop should not immediately set `done` to false if one cell is not present.

The correct approach should be to check whether any cell of an artifact is not in the set and set `done` to false in that case, then break the inner loop because if one cell is not present, the whole artifact cannot be fully excavated.

Here's the debugging and fix process:

1. In the inner loop, fix the condition to break the loop if a cell is not in the set:
   ```java
   for (int i = a[0]; i <= a[2]; i++) {
       for (int j = a[1]; j <= a[3]; j++) {
           if (!set.contains(i + " " + j)) {
               done = false;
               break; // Exit the inner loop
           }
       }
       if (!done) {
           break; // Exit the outer loop
       }
   }
   ```

2. Update the outer loop to break if the inner loop set `done` to false:
   ```java
   if (done) {
       c++;
   }
   ```

Modified code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int digArtifacts(int n, int[][] artifacts, int[][] dig) {
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int d[] : dig) {
            set.add(d[0] + " " + d[1]);
        }
        int c = 0;
        for (int a[] : artifacts) {
            boolean done = true;
            for (int i = a[0]; i <= a[2]; i++) {
                for (int j = a[1]; j <= a[3]; j++) {
                    if (!set.contains(i + " " + j)) {
                        done = false;
                        break; // Exit the inner loop
                    }
                }
                if (!done) {
                    break; // Exit the outer loop
                }
            }
            if (done) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```

The modifications made ensure that the correct number of artifacts is counted. The time complexity of the code remains the same as the original.
