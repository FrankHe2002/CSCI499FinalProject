The given code is intended to find the original array from a changed array that has been formed by doubling each element of the original array and then shuffling the elements randomly. 

Upon reviewing the provided code, the following bugs can be identified:
1. The code does not check for the sorted double array.
2. The code does not check for duplicate elements.

Let's consider the given steps to identify the bugs and fix the code:
1. The code first sorts the `changed` array, then it calculates the middle index and initializes the result. The frequency of elements is counted in the `changed` array using the `freq` array.
2. The code goes through each element of the `changed` array and checks if the frequency of the element and its doubled value are greater than 0. Then, decrements the frequency of both the elements and stores the original element in the result.
3. Finally, the code checks if there are any remaining elements in the `changed` array using the `freq` array and returns an empty array if there are any remaining elements.

Now, let's fix the identified bugs and apply the changes in the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] findOriginalArray(int[] changed) {
        Arrays.sort(changed);

        if (changed.length % 2 != 0) return new int[0];

        int[] res = new int[changed.length / 2];
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();

        for (int no : changed)
            frequencyMap.put(no, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(no, 0) + 1);

        int idx = 0;

        for (int no : changed) {
            if (frequencyMap.getOrDefault(no, 0) > 0 && frequencyMap.getOrDefault(no * 2, 0) > 0) {
                frequencyMap.put(no, frequencyMap.get(no) - 1);
                frequencyMap.put(no * 2, frequencyMap.get(no * 2) - 1);
                res[idx++] = no;
            }
        }

        for (int value : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (value > 0)
                return new int[0];
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
- Used a Map `frequencyMap` to store the frequency of elements in the `changed` array.
- The `idx` is used to keep track of the position to store the elements in the `res` array.
- Check for duplicate elements by getting the frequency from the map and update the frequencies.
- Finally, looped through the frequency map and if any frequency is greater than 0, returns an empty array.

These changes will address the identified issues and provide a correct and efficient solution.
