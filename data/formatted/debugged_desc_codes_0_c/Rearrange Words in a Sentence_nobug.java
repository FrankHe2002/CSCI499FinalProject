There seems to be a bug in the code. The bug is in the sorting logic. The code is not following the constraint to maintain the original order of words with the same length.

To fix the bug, I will modify the comparator used in the `Arrays.sort` method to include the original order comparison logic. I will add a conditional check to see if two words have the same length, and in that case, compare their original order.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public String arrangeWords(String text) {
        String[] words = text.split(" ");
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            words[i] = words[i].toLowerCase();
        }
        Arrays.sort(words, (s, t) -> {
            if (s.length() == t.length()) {
                return 0; // Maintain the original order for words with the same length
            }
            return s.length() - t.length();
        });
        words[0] = Character.toUpperCase(words[0].charAt(0)) + words[0].substring(1);
        return String.join(" ", words);
    }
}
```
