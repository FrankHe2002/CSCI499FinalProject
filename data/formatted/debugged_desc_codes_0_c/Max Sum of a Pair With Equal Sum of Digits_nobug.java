Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the sum of digits of each number and stores the result in a HashMap, with the sum of digits as the key and the number as the value.
2. If the sum of digits already exists in the map, it updates the result to be the maximum of the previous result and the sum of the current number and the number stored in the map for that sum of digits.
3. After processing all numbers, it returns the result, which is the maximum sum of two numbers whose digit sum is equal.

The logic seems correct. However, there is a small mistake in the calculation step, or key assignment in map.

The bug occurs in line 13: `map.put(key, Math.max(map.get(key), item));`
We don't need maximum here as we are storing the number based on the total. Instead, we should just directly put the number.

The corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumSum(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int result = - 1;

        for (int item : nums) {
            int key = getNumberTotal(item);

            if (!map.containsKey(key))
                map.put(key, item);
            else {
                result = Math.max(result, map.get(key) + item);
                // Remove Math.max here
                map.put(key, item);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    int getNumberTotal(int num) {
        int result = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            result += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
