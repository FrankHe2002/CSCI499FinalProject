Bug: The code contains a potential bug in the variable name used incorrectly in the line `int coldash = col1 + dir[j][1];`. The variable `j` is being used as an index of the `dir` array, but it should be `j` instead.

Code Fix:

```java
int coldash = col1 + dir[j][1];
```
I have corrected the incorrect variable usage by replacing `d2val` with `j` in the line `int coldash = col1 + dir[d2val][1];` in the code.
