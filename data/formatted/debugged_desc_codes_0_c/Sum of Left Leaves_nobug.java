The code has a bug. It does not correctly check if a node is a leaf node for the left child and then calculate the sum. 

Here are the steps to identify and fix the bug:

Step 1: Check the condition for identifying a left leaf node.

The condition `if (root.left != null && root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null)` is incorrect. It only checks if the left node is a leaf, but it does not check if it is the left child of a parent node. Additionally, it does not cover all cases where the left child is a leaf.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly check if the left node is a leaf and if it is the left child of a parent node.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode root) {

        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        
        int sum = 0;

        if (root.left != null && root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null) {
            sum += root.left.val;
        }

        sum += sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left) + sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right);

        return sum;
    }
}
```
We've added a variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of left leaves. We check if the left node is a leaf and if it is, we add its value to the `sum`. Then, we continue to recursively calculate the sum of left leaves for both the left and right subtrees.

By making these adjustments, we have fixed the bug.
