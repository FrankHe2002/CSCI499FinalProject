The given code is an implementation of a solution to the House Robber problem using dynamic programming. The goal is to maximize the amount of money that can be stolen without alerting the police, given the constraint that adjacent houses have security systems.
Upon reviewing the code, it appears that there is a logical bug in the `helper` method, specifically in the loop in the `rob` method.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The loop in the `rob` method starts from `i = -1`, which is incorrect. The loop should start from `i = 0` as it iterates over the elements in the `t` array.
2. As the code is based on dynamic programming, it calculates the maximum amount that can be robbed from each house by considering the choices of either picking the money from the current house and skipping the next house or skipping the current house and considering the next house.
3. The dynamic programming approach makes use of memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times.

Here's the updated code with minimal changes:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 35.8 MB (Top 96.84%)
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int[] t = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(t, -1); // fill the array with -1
        return helper(nums, 0, t);
    }

    static int helper(int[] nums, int i, int[] t) {
        if (i >= nums.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (i == nums.length - 1) {
            return nums[i];
        }
        if (t[i] != -1) {
            return t[i];
        }

        int pick = nums[i] + helper(nums, i + 2, t);
        int unpicked = helper(nums, i + 1, t);
        t[i] = Math.max(pick, unpicked);
        return t[i];
    }
}
```

The fix includes the following changes:
1. Initialize the `t` array with all elements set to -1 using `Arrays.fill()`.
2. Start the loop in the `rob` method from `i = 0`.

These changes address the logical bug and ensure that the code correctly calculates the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the houses without triggering the security systems.
