The bug in the provided Java code is in the if-else statement within the second for loop. The condition inside the if statement is incorrect. When comparing if the current kid's candies plus the extra candies are greater than or equal to the highest number of candies, the equation should be `candies[i] + extraCandies >= theHighest`. However, the code compares `candies[i]` with `mathLogic` instead, which is the result of `theHighest - extraCandies`.

To fix this bug, the condition inside the if statement at line 16 should be modified.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>(candies.length);
        int theHighest = candies[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < candies.length; i++) {
            theHighest = Math.max(theHighest, candies[i]);
        }
        int threshold = theHighest - extraCandies; // Use a meaningful variable name
        for (int i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
            if (candies[i] + extraCandies >= theHighest) { // Compare with the highest number of candies
                result.add(true);
            } else {
                result.add(false);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, the condition inside the if statement at line 16 has been changed to `candies[i] + extraCandies >= theHighest`, which compares the total number of candies after adding extra candies with the highest number of candies correctly. Additionally, I've also used a more descriptive variable name, `threshold`, instead of `mathLogic`, to make the code clearer.
