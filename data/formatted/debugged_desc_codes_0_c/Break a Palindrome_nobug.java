Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The code is intended to find the lexicographically smallest string that is not a palindrome by replacing a character if possible. However, the logic inside the while loop to find the lexicographically smallest non-palindromic string is incorrect.

The following steps can be executed to fix and identify the bug:
1. The loop should check if the current character is not 'a' and then replace it with 'a' to ensure the resulting string is not a palindrome. If all characters are 'a', then it should be replaced with 'b' to ensure it is lexicographically smallest non-palindromic string.
2. If the length of the input palindrome is odd, consider the middle character as a special case as it does not affect whether the string is a palindrome or not.

To fix this, I will modify the while loop to correctly handle the logic and account for the middle character if the length is odd. The revised code is below:

```java
class Solution {
    public String breakPalindrome(String palindrome) {

        if (palindrome.length() == 1) {
            return "";
        }

        int left = 0;
        int right = palindrome.length() - 1;
        char[] chars = palindrome.toCharArray();

        while (left < right) {
            if (chars[left] != 'a') {
                chars[left] = 'a';
                return String.valueOf(chars);
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }

        if (palindrome.length() % 2 != 0) {
            chars[palindrome.length() / 2] = 'b';
            return String.valueOf(chars);
        } else {
            chars[palindrome.length() - 1] = 'b';
            return String.valueOf(chars);
        }
    }
}
```

I made the following changes to the code:
1. Removed the unnecessary StringBuilder and directly converted the array of characters to a string using `String.valueOf(chars)`.
2. Added special handling for the middle character if the length of the palindrome is odd.
