The identified bug in the code is a logical error in the else block of the for loop. The code is using `timeSeries[1]` instead of `timeSeries[i]` to calculate the difference between the current timeSeries element and the previous one.

To fix this bug, the correct timeSeries element should be used to calculate the duration of poison effect. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < timeSeries.length; i++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                sum += duration;
            } else {
                sum += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i - 1]);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
