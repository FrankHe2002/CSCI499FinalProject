Bug: The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
1. The code is using dynamic programming to solve the problem with a 2D array dp. 
2. The program initializes the dp array with the startFuel, meaning that at each station, the dp array is supposed to have the maximum distance that can be traveled with the fuel available.
3. The nested loops then try to update the dp array at each station by either not refueling (dp[i-1][j]) or refueling at the current station (dp[i-1][j-1] + stations[i-1][1]).
4. The program then checks if the maximum distance that can be traveled dp[i][j] is greater than or equal to the target, in which case it returns the number of refueling stops.

Identifying and Fixing the Bug:
In the inner loop, the condition `stations[i - 1][0] > dp[i - 1][j - 0]` is incorrect. This condition checks if the distance to the current station is greater than the maximum distance that can be traveled without refueling, which is not a correct condition.

The condition should check if the distance to the current station is greater than the current maximum distance that can be traveled after stopping at j gas stations, i.e., if `stations[i - 1][0] > dp[j]`. 

Apply the fix using minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, int[][] stations) {
        if (startFuel >= target) return 0;
        int n = stations.length;
        long[] dp = new long[n + 1]; // 1D array is sufficient
        dp[0] = startFuel;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j >= 0 && stations[i][0] <= dp[j]; j--) {
                dp[j + 1] = Math.max(dp[j + 1], dp[j] + stations[i][1]);
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            if (dp[i] >= target) return i;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
