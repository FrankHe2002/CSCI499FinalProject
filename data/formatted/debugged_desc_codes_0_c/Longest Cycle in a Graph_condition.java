Bug type:
1. Logical Error
2. Array Out of Bounds
This code defines the Solution class with a method called longestCycle which accepts an array of integers as input. Within the Solution class, there is a helper method called helper that takes multiple parameters. The code intends to find the length of the longest cycle in the given directed graph. 

The bug in the code is a logical error in the helper method. The condition to return the result should be to check if the result is -1 or not, instead of checking if the map[index] is equal to 0. This condition will not terminate the recursion when it should and will result in an incorrect output.

Another potential bug in the code is that the length of the map array is not considered when accessing elements. This could lead to an array out of bounds error in certain cases.

Corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 44 ms (Top 81.42%) | Memory: 99.3 MB (Top 65.13%)
class Solution {
    public int longestCycle(int[] edges) {
        int[] map = new int[edges.length];
        int result = - 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++)
            result = Math.max(result, helper(i, 1, edges, map));

        return result;
    }

    int helper(int index, int total, int[] edges, int[] map) {
        if (index == - 1 || map[index] == - 1)
            return - 1;

        if (map[index] != 0)
            return total - map[index];

        map[index] = total;
        int result = helper(edges[index], total + 1, edges, map);
        map[index] = - 1;

        return result;
    }
}
```
