The bug in the code is the logic used in the while loop of the `preimageSizeFZF` method. The loop is designed to find the value of `n` such that `zeros(n)` equals `k`. However, the implementation is incorrect as it always returns 5, which is hardcoded.

The logic in the `zeros` method is to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial. But the condition in the `preimageSizeFZF` method doesn't reflect the purpose of finding the value of `n` which satisfies the `zeros(n) == k`.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the values of `n` and check for `zeros(n) == k`. When `t == k`, we should increment the response count. Additionally, the condition for generating `n` needs to be slightly altered.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int preimageSizeFZF(int k) {
        long left = 0, right = 5L * (long) (k + 1);
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int t = zeros(mid);
            if (t == k) {
                return 5;
            } else if (t < k) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

    private int zeros(long n) {
        int resp = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            resp += (int) (n / 5);
            n /= 5;
        }
        return resp;
    }
}
```
