Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is using a hardcoded value of 3 for the array index to retrieve the number of columns in the matrix.
2. This could lead to an "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" if the matrix size is smaller than 4x4.
3. The logic to count the negative numbers is also incorrect. It should be counting negative numbers row-wise and not row-wise and column-wise combined.

Fix:
1. Use the variable "m" to get the number of rows in the matrix and "n" to get the number of columns.
2. Update the logic to count negative numbers by iterating through each row and each column and incrementing the count whenever a negative number is encountered.

Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countNegatives(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] < 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
