There appears to be a bug in the `minTaps` method of the `Solution` class in the provided Java code.

The `minTaps` method aims to calculate the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the entire garden based on the input `n` and `ranges` array. However, a bug appears to be present in the conditional logic for updating the `cur` and `end` variables.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the if condition `if (j - ranges[j] > cur)` should update the `cur` variable to `end` instead of `cur`. This is because the current condition is only updating the `cur` variable, resulting in incorrect comparisons.

Additionally, the conditional statement `if (j - ranges[j] <= cur)` seems to be redundant, as it is covered by the subsequent conditional block. 

To fix the bug, the code should update the `cur` variable to `end` when `j - ranges[j] > cur` and remove the redundant conditional statement altogether.

Below is the corrected code after applying the fix:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minTaps(int n, int[] ranges) {
        Integer[] idx = IntStream.range(0, ranges.length).boxed().toArray(Integer[]::new);
        Arrays.sort(idx, Comparator.comparingInt(o -> o - ranges[o]));
        int ans = 1, cur = 0, end = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ranges.length && end < n; i++) {
            int j = idx[i];
            if (j - ranges[j] > cur) {
                cur = end; // Fix: Update `cur` to `end` instead
                ans++;
            }
            end = Math.max(end, j + ranges[j]); // Remove redundant conditional
        }
        return end < n ? -1 : ans;
    }
}
```

The updated conditional logic ensures that the `cur` variable is correctly updated to `end` when `j - ranges[j] > cur`. Moreover, the redundant conditional statement has been removed to enhance the readability and efficiency of the code.
