The code is supposed to count the number of nodes in the subtree of each node, which have the same label as that node. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The parameter `n` in the `countSubTrees` method has the same name as the local variable `n` inside the `postOrderDfs` method, which can be confusing. It would be better to have different names to avoid confusion.

2. The `postOrderDfs` method is returning an array with the counts of characters, but the main purpose is to update the `res` array with the counts and return void. This is not aligned with the method signature and description.

3. The counting of characters in the `postOrderDfs` method is incorrect. It should accumulate the counts instead of reseting it for each node.

4. The character counting starts at the next character on the ASCII table. This is due to incrementing the count before counting the character in the `postOrderDfs` method.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int[] res;

    public int[] countSubTrees(int n, int[][] edges, String labels) {
        res = new int[n];
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adjList = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjList.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            adjList.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            adjList.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        postOrderDfs(adjList, labels, 0, -1);
        return res;
    }

    void postOrderDfs(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adjList, String labels, int node, int parent) {
        int[] chars = new int[26];
        chars[labels.charAt(node) - 'a']++;
        for (int next : adjList.get(node)) {
            if (next != parent) {
                int[] childChars = postOrderDfs(adjList, labels, next, node);
                mergeArrCounts(chars, childChars);
            }
        }
        res[node] = chars[labels.charAt(node) - 'a'];
    }

    // Merge from B to A
    void mergeArrCounts(int[] A, int[] B) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            A[i] += B[i];
        }
    }
}
```
