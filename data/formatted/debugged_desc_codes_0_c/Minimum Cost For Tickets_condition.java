The issue in the code is that when calculating the minimum cost for the current day, the program should consider the cost at that day as well. There appears to be an off-by-one error in the iteration of the loop. The loop goes up to `for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)` where n is the last day, but it should be inclusive of the last day.

Additionally, for the first day, the cost of travel needs to be considered. 

Below is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int mincostTickets(int[] days, int[] costs) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int day : days) set.add(day);
        int n = days[days.length - 1];
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // Fix - change < to <=
            if (!set.contains(i)) {
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
                continue;
            }
            int a = dp[Math.max(0, i - 1)] + costs[0];
            int b = dp[Math.max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1];
            int c = dp[Math.max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2];
            dp[i] = Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c));
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
