The code appears to be using the Arrays.copyOfRange method to create a duplicate of the heights array and then sorting the duplicate array in non-decreasing order. Then, it compares each element of the original heights array with the corresponding element in the sorted duplicate array and increments the count if they are not equal.

After reviewing the given code, it seems to be correct and the logic also looks fine. Therefore, there is no bug in the code.

No bug identified.
