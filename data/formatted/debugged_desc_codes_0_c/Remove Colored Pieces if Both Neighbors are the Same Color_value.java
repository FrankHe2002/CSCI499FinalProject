The given code has a bug. The bug is in the for loop range, where it should start from 1 to length - 1, as it is trying to access i-1 and i+1 which is going out of bounds for the array.

Fix the code by changing the loop range and checking for the length to be greater than 2 to ensure that the neighbors exist for each element in the colors string.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean winnerOfGame(String colors) {
        int cntA = 0, cntB = 0;
        if (colors.length() >= 3) {
            for (int i = 1; i < colors.length() - 1; i++) {
                if (colors.charAt(i) == 'A' && colors.charAt(i - 1) == 'A' && colors.charAt(i + 1) == 'A') cntA++;
                if (colors.charAt(i) == 'B' && colors.charAt(i - 1) == 'B' && colors.charAt(i + 1) == 'B') cntB++;
            }
        }
        return cntA > cntB;
    }
}
```
