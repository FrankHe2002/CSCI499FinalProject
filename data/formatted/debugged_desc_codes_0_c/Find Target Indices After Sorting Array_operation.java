The code logic looks correct, and it should work as expected. There is no bug in the code. However, the method name should be changed from `targetIndices` to `findTargetIndices` to be consistent with the method's purpose of finding and returning the target indices.

Here's the corrected code with the method name updated:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 82.14%) | Memory: 43.8 MB (Top 60.21-)
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    /**
     * Algorithm:
     * - Parse the array once and count how many are lesser than target and how many are equal
     * - DO NOT sort the array as we don't need it sorted.
     * Just to know how many are lesser and how many are equal. O(N) better than O(NlogN - sorting)
     * - The response list will have a size = with the number of equal elements (as their positions)
     * - Loop from smaller to smaller+equal and add the values into the list. Return the list
     */
    public List<Integer> findTargetIndices(int[] nums, int target) {
        int smaller = 0;
        int equal = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < target) {
                smaller++;
            } else if (num == target) {
                equal++;
            }
        }
        List<Integer> indices = new ArrayList<>(equal);
        for (int i = smaller; i < smaller + equal; i++) {
            indices.add(i);
        }
        return indices;
    }
}
```
