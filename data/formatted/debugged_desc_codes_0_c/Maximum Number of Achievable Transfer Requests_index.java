The potential bug in the code is in the `helper` method while processing the requests. The code is not updating the count for the buildings in the correct way, resulting in an incorrect count, and hence, a wrong result. 

Upon reviewing the code, it is identified that the bug is in the following line:
```java
count[requests[2][0]]++;
```
This line should be:
```java
count[requests[index][0]]++;
```
Also, the swapping count for `requests[index][0]` and `requests[index][1]` are incorrect.
To fix this issue, an update is needed in two locations:

1. Update the count for `requests[index][0]` before the recursive call.
2. Update the count for `requests[index][1]` after the recursive call.

Here is the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    int max = 0;
    public int maximumRequests(int n, int[][] requests) {
        helper(requests, 0, new int[n], 0);
        return max;
    }

    private void helper(int[][] requests, int index, int[] count, int num) {
        if (index == requests.length) {
            for (int i : count) {
                if (i != 0) {
                    return;
                }
            }
            max = Math.max(max, num);
            return;
        }

        count[requests[index][0]]++; // Update count for requests[index][0]
        count[requests[index][1]]--; // Update count for requests[index][1]
        helper(requests, index + 1, count, num + 1);
        count[requests[index][0]]--; // Revert the count update for requests[index][0]
        count[requests[index][1]]++; // Revert the count update for requests[index][1]

        // Not Choose the request
        helper(requests, index + 1, count, num);
    }
}
```

With these changes, the bug has been resolved and the code should now correctly calculate the maximum number of achievable requests.
