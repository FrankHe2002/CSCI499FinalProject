The bug is in the `colorTheGrid` method where the adjacency list is being populated. The bug type is a syntax error.

In the code provided, the bug is in the following section of the `colorTheGrid` method:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < adj.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arr.size(); j++) {
        if (Match(arr.get(i), arr.get(j))) {
            adj.get(i).add(j)
        }
    }
}
```
On the line `adj.get(i).add(j)`, there is a missing semicolon at the end of the line which is causing a syntax error.

To fix this bug, the missing semicolon should be added.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < adj.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arr.size(); j++) {
        if (Match(arr.get(i), arr.get(j))) {
            adj.get(i).add(j);
        }
    }
}
```
This will fix the syntax error and the code should work as intended.
