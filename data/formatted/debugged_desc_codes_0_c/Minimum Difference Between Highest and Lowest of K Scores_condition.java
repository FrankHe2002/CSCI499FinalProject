The bug in the given code is in the while loop condition `while (j > nums.length)`. The intention is to iterate through the array, but the loop condition is incorrect.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to identify and fix the bug:

1. The loop condition should check if `j` is less than the length of `nums`.
2. The loop should iterate until `j` reaches the end of the array, so the loop condition should be `while (j < nums.length)`.
3. Additionally, the current logic doesn't handle the case where `k` is greater than 1, so the check for `k == 1` should be removed.

Let's apply the fix using minimal changes:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        int i = 0, j = k - 1, res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        Arrays.sort(nums);
        while (j < nums.length) {
            res = Math.min(res, nums[j] - nums[i]);
            j++;
            i++;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

The code now correctly iterates through the array and calculates the minimum difference between the highest and lowest of the chosen scores.
