The code seems to have a bug in the `next` method. The bug occurs when the `current` node is null and the `next` method is called. It should return -1 when there is no next element, but it should also set `current` to null in that case. Otherwise, the `hasNext` method may return true when it should not.

To fix this bug, we can add the line `current = null;` after the `else` block that returns -1 in the `next` method.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class BSTIterator {

    TreeNode root;
    TreeNode current;
    Stack<TreeNode> st = new Stack<>();

    public BSTIterator(TreeNode root) {
        this.root = root;
        //init(root);
        current = findLeft(root);
        //System.out.println("Init: stack is: "+st);
    }

    public int next() {

        int val = - 1;
        if (current != null)
            val = current.val;
        else {
            current = null;  // New line to set current to null when there is no next element
            return - 1;
        }

        if (current.right != null)
            current = findLeft(current.right);
        else if (! st.isEmpty())
            current = st.pop();
        else
            current = null;
        // System.out.println("next: stack is: "+st);
        return val;
    }

    public TreeNode findLeft(TreeNode node) {

        if (node == null)
            return null;

        if (node.left != null) {
            TreeNode next = node.left;
            st.push(node);
            return findLeft(next);
        } else
            return node;

    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return current != null;
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that the `hasNext` method returns the correct value, and the `next` method behaves as expected when there are no more elements to iterate through.
