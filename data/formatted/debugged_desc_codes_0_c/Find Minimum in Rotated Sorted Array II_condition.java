The code is attempting to find the minimum element in a sorted, rotated array. After reviewing the code, we notice that the issue lies in the second while condition.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the issue:

1. The first while loop removes duplicates from the beginning (l) of the array.
2. The second while loop should remove duplicates from the end (h) of the array. However, the condition `while (l >= h && nums[h] == nums[h - 1])` is incorrect.
3. The condition `while (l >= h && nums[h] == nums[h - 1])` should be replaced with `while (l < h && nums[h] == nums[h - 1])` to properly remove duplicates from the end of the array.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int h = nums.length - 1;
        while (l < h) {
            while (l < h && nums[l] == nums[l + 1])
                ++l;
            while (l < h && nums[h] == nums[h - 1])  // Fix the condition
                --h;
            int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[h]) { // smaller elements are in the right side
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                h = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
}
```
The condition in the second while loop has been fixed, and the rest of the code remains unchanged.
