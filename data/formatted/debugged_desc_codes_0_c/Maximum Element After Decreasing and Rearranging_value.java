There seems to be a bug in the given code. The bug is that the conditions are not checked for every element in the array, and the decrementing operation is only performed if the absolute difference between adjacent elements is greater than 1. However, the maximum possible value of an element in arr after performing the operations to satisfy the conditions is required.

To fix this issue, the following changes can be made to the given code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        arr[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] > 1)
                arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + 1;
        }
        return arr[arr.length - 1];
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the loop is modified to start from `1` instead of `2` to check the conditions for every element in the array. Additionally, the condition in the loop is also changed to `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] > 1` to properly perform the decrementing operation if the difference is greater than 1.

These changes ensure that the conditions are checked for every element and the decrementing operation is performed as required.
