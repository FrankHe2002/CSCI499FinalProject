The code appears to have several issues:
1. The misspelling of `shefWidth` instead of `shelfWidth`.
2. The missing semicolon at the end of the `if` statement inside the `findMinHeight` method.
3. The recursion logic of the `findMinHeight` method seems incorrect.

To fix these issues, the following changes can be made:
- Correct the spelling of `shefWidth` to `shelfWidth` in the class variable declaration.
- Add the missing semicolon at the end of the `if` statement inside the `findMinHeight` method.
- Modify the recursion logic in the `findMinHeight` method to handle the placement of books on shelves.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    int[][] books;
    int shelfWidth;

    Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();

    public int findMinHeight(int curr, int maxHeight, int wRem) {
        String key = curr + ":" + wRem;

        if (memo.containsKey(key)) return memo.get(key);

        if (curr == books.length) return maxHeight;

        int[] currBook = books[curr];

        int heightNewShelf = findMinHeight(curr + 1, currBook[1], shelfWidth - currBook[0]) + maxHeight;
        int heightSameShelf = findMinHeight(curr + 1, Math.max(maxHeight, currBook[1]), wRem - currBook[0]);

        int minHeight = Math.min(heightNewShelf, heightSameShelf);
        memo.put(key, minHeight);

        return minHeight;
    }

    public int minHeightShelves(int[][] books, int shelfWidth) {
        this.books = books;
        this.shelfWidth = shelfWidth;
        return findMinHeight(0, 0, shelfWidth);
    }
}
```
