Bug type:
1. Logical error
2. Array index out of bounds

Identifying the bug:
1. The function `minimumOperations` is attempting to find the minimum number of operations required to make the array alternating. The logic inside the function should iterate over the array and update the frequency of odd and even indexes while identifying the maximum frequency for each number.
2. There is one place where the indexing might go out of bounds, specifically in the following line: `ans = Math.max(ans, Math.max(freq[i][0] + k, freq[i][1] + j));` because the `freq` array is initialized with a size of `[100005][2]` but the iteration is done up to `i <= 100000`.

Fixing the bug:
1. In the given scenario, the maximum size required for the `freq` array is `100005`, where each number can occur at most once at an odd index and once at an even index. So the declaration for the `freq` array with a size of `[100005][2]` is correct.
2. While accessing elements from the `freq` array, we need to ensure that the indices do not go out of bounds by using `i < 100005` in the loop and within the `for` loop in line `for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {`. 
3. After the updates, we should return the required number of operations as `ans` and not `nums.length % ans` as the number of operations.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        int freq[][] = new int[100005][2];
        int i, j, k, ans = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            freq[nums[i]][i & 1]++;
        }
        for (i = 1, j = k = 0; i < 100005; i++) { // Fixed: Check i < 100005
            ans = Math.max(ans, Math.max(freq[i][0] + k, freq[i][1] + j));
            j = Math.max(j, freq[i][0]);
            k = Math.max(k, freq[i][1]);
        }
        return nums.length - ans; // Fixed: Return correct number of operations
    }
}
```
