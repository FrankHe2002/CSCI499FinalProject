The code has a bug in the nested for loop when calculating the rank. The variable city4 should be city2. This is likely a typographical error.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximalNetworkRank(int n, int[][] roads) {

        //number of road connected to city
        int[] numRoadsConnectedCity = new int[100 + 1];

        //road exist between two two cities
        boolean[][] roadExist = new boolean[n][n];

        for (int[] cities : roads) {

            //increment the count of numbers of connected city
            numRoadsConnectedCity[cities[0]]++;
            numRoadsConnectedCity[cities[1]]++;

            //mark road exist, between two cities
            roadExist[cities[0]][cities[1]] = true;
            roadExist[cities[1]][cities[0]] = true;
        }


        int maxRank = 0;
        for (int city1 = 0; city1 < n - 1; city1++) {
            for (int city2 = city1 + 1; city2 < n; city2++) {

                //count total number of road connected to both city
                int rank = numRoadsConnectedCity[city1] + numRoadsConnectedCity[city2];

                //just decrement the rank, if both city connected
                if (roadExist[city1][city2]) rank--;

                maxRank = Math.max(maxRank, rank);
            }
        }

        return maxRank;
    }
}
```
