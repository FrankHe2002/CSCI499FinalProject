There are issues with the logic of the provided code.

Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code needs to find the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.
2. The code is counting the number of '0's and '1's in the input string s, which is not the correct approach to solve the given problem.
3. Also, the code incorrectly computes the sum of binary values while iterating through the string which does not guarantee the longest subsequence which is less than or equal to k.

Based on the identified logical error, the following fix is proposed:

Fix:
I will use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. I will create a dp array of size s.length + 1 to store the maximum length of a subsequence for each prefix of the input string s.
I will iterate through the input string s and compute the possible lengths by setting the current dp value to max of either the previous dp value or the current dp value. The value of dp[i] will be set to dp[i-1] if s[i-1] is '0', otherwise it will be set to max(dp[i], dp[i-1] + 1) if s[i-1] is '1'.
At the end, I will return the last value in the dp array which represents the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

The updated code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = s.charAt(i - 1) == '0' ? dp[i - 1] : Math.max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + 1);
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
