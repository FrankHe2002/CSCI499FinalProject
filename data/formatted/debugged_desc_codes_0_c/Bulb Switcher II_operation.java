The bug is related to the logic in the `flipLights` method, where the number of different possible statuses after performing all button presses is not being calculated correctly. The calculations for the different possible statuses are not aligned with the requirements.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `flipLights` method to correctly calculate the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses based on the given constraints.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int flipLights(int n, int presses) {
        if (n == 2) {
            if (presses == 1) {
                return 3;
            } else {
                return 4; // for other values of presses
            }
        }
        
        if (n == 1) {
            return 2; // Return 2 because the only possible statuses are all on or all off.
        }
        
        if (presses == 1) {
            return 4; // All on, all off, even on, odd on
        }
        
        if (presses == 2) {
            return 7; // Covers all possible combinations with 2 presses
        }
        
        // For presses >= 3
        return 8; // All combinations can be achieved with 3 or more presses
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
- We updated the logic to handle the special case where `n` is equal to 2.
- We added a special case for `n` equal to 1, where the only possible statuses are all on or all off.
- We adjusted the conditional statements and return values to correctly calculate the number of different possible statuses for different number of presses and values of `n`.
- We removed the arbitrary bitwise shift operation and used explicit checks and return values based on the constraints.
