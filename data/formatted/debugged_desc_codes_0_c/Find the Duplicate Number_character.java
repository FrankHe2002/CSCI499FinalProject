Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code defines a method `findDuplicate` to find the repeated number.
2. It then creates a `while` loop to iterate through the `nums` array.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `nums[i]` is not equal to its expected value `i + 1`. If not, it finds the correct index for the current element and checks if the current element and the element at the correct index are the same or not. If they are not the same, it swaps the elements.
4. If they are the same, it returns the current element as the repeated number.
5. If the current element is equal to the expected value `i + 1`, it increments `i` and continues to the next iteration.
6. After the loop, it returns -1 if no repeated number is found.

Identified bug:
The algorithm in the given code is trying to swap the elements to make each element appear in its correct position. However, the current approach does not guarantee finding the repeated number without modifying the `nums` array. It is not solving the problem as required.

Fix:
The correct approach to solve the problem would be to use the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm, also known as the slow and fast pointer approach. This will solve the problem in linear runtime complexity without modifying the array `nums`.

Here is the fixed code using the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int tortoise = nums[0];
        int hare = nums[0];
        do {
            tortoise = nums[tortoise];
            hare = nums[nums[hare]];
        } while (tortoise != hare);

        tortoise = nums[0];
        while (tortoise != hare) {
            tortoise = nums[tortoise];
            hare = nums[hare];
        }

        return hare;
    }
}
```
The fixed code uses the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to find the repeated number in `nums` without modifying the array and requires only constant extra space.
