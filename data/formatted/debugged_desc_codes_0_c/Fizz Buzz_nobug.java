The bug in the given code is that the variables `fizz` and `buzz` are incremented in every iteration of the loop, even if they are supposed to represent a modulo operation with 3 and 5 respectively. This results in the incorrect check for divisibility by 3 and 5.

To fix this bug, the `fizz` and `buzz` variables should be incremented only when the value of `i` is not divisible by 3 or 5, respectively.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        List<String> l = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 1, fizz = 0, buzz = 0; i <= n; i++, fizz++, buzz++) {
            if (fizz == 3 && buzz == 5) {
                l.add("FizzBuzz");
                fizz = 0;
                buzz = 0;
            } else if (fizz == 3) {
                l.add("Fizz");
                fizz = 0;
            } else if (buzz == 5) {
                l.add("Buzz");
                buzz = 0;
            } else {
                l.add(String.valueOf(i));
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```
