Bug type: Logical error

Review:
1. The code creates a map to store the keyName and a PriorityQueue of keyTimes for each name.
2. It then iterates through the map and checks if each worker used the keycard 3 or more times in a one-hour period.
3. If they did, it adds the worker's name to the list of alerts.

Identifying the bug:
Upon reviewing the code, it appears that there is a logical error in the `active` method, which is supposed to determine if there were 3 uses within an hour. 
The issue lies in the comparison of the time difference. The lines "if (c - a <= 100) return true;" and "if (c - a <= 100) return true;" incorrectly use the subtraction of the time values to check if they are within one hour, particularly the subtraction of the minutes from the hour. These lines should take into account the fact that the time format goes from 0 to 2359 and not just hour and minutes.

Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to calculate the time in minutes for each time stamp and then compare the difference to see if it is less than or equal to 60 minutes (one hour) rather than comparing hours and minutes separately.

Here's the modified code with the logical bug fixed:

```java
import java.util.*;
class Solution {
    public List<String> alertNames(String[] keyName, String[] keyTime) {
        Map<String, PriorityQueue<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
        // for every entry in keyName and keyTime, add that time to a priorityqueue for that name
        for (int i = 0; i < keyName.length; i++) {
            PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = map.getOrDefault(keyName[i], new PriorityQueue<Integer>());
            //convert the time to an integer (0- 2359 inclusive for easy comparisons
            pq.add(timeToMinutes(keyTime[i]));
            map.put(keyName[i], pq);
        }

        // Generate the "answer" list
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String s : map.keySet()) {
            // For each name in the map, determine if that name used the keycard within 1 hour
            PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = map.get(s);
            if (active(pq)) {
                ans.add(s);
            }
        }

        // Sort the names alphabetically
        Collections.sort(ans);
        return ans;
    }

    // Greedy function to determine if there were 3 uses within an hour
    private boolean active(PriorityQueue<Integer> pq) {
        // If there are two or less entries, the user could not have entered 3 times, return false
        if (pq.size() < 3) return false;

        // Create rolling data
        // Using PriorityQueues, the lowest number is removed first by default
        int a = pq.poll();
        int b = pq.poll();
        int c = pq.poll();

        // Test if two entrances are within 1 hour (60 minutes as per timeToMinutes conversion)
        if (c - a <= 60) return true;
        while (pq.size() > 0) {
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = pq.poll();
            if (c - a <= 60) return true;
        }

        // If the full Queue has been checked, return false
        return false;
    }

    // Convert time to minutes for comparison
    private int timeToMinutes(String time) {
        int hours = Integer.parseInt(time.substring(0, 2));
        int minutes = Integer.parseInt(time.substring(3));
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    }
}
```

In the modified code, I added a new helper method `timeToMinutes` that converts the given time to minutes for easy comparison. I used this method along with modifying the conditions inside the `active` method to compare the time difference in minutes and not in hours and minutes separately. This should fix the logical issue in the original code.
