The code loops through the nums array and checks whether the current element is within the range [left, right]. If it is, it updates the `e` (end) index to the current index. If the element is greater than `right`, it updates both `s` (start) and `e` to the current index.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the logic to calculate the number of subarrays is incorrect. The `res` variable is updated by adding `e + s` in each iteration, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to count the number of subarrays that can be formed using the current end index `e` and the previous start index `s`.

To fix the code, the logic to update the `res` variable needs to be changed to count the number of subarrays correctly by using the difference between `e` and `s`, and then adding 1 to it at each iteration.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 82.54%) | Memory: 72.1 MB (Top 7.10%)
class Solution {
    public int numSubarrayBoundedMax(int[] nums, int left, int right) {
        int res = 0;

        int s = -1;
        int e = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

            if (nums[i] >= left && nums[i] <= right) {
                e = i;
            } else if (nums[i] > right) {
                s = i;
                e = i;
            }

            res += (e - s);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
