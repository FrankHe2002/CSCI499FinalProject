The code has been structured well and seems to be logically correct. However, the bug seems to be related to the loop conditions in the `powerfulIntegers` method.

Upon inspecting the loop conditions, we can see that the loops are not covering all possible combinations of powerful integers. The loop conditions are based only on the value of `x` and `y`, which is causing the issue. 

To fix the bug, the logic should calculate all combinations of i^x + j^y where i and j are integers and should be less than or equal to 'bound'. 

The most efficient way to fix the bug is to use two nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of i and j, based on the constraints provided.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; Math.pow(x, i) <= bound; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; Math.pow(y, j) <= bound; j++) {
                int value = (int) (Math.pow(x, i) + Math.pow(y, j));
                if (value <= bound) {
                    set.add(value);
                }
                if (y == 1) break;
            }
            if (x == 1) break;
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(set);
    }
}
```
