The identified bug in the given Java code is in the conditional statement for checking non-zero elements in the diagonals of the matrix. The issue is at the line `if (grid[i][2] == 0)` which is checking if the element at position [i][2] is zero, instead of checking the diagonal elements at [i][i] and [i][n - 1 - i].

To fix the bug:
1. Correct the conditional statement to check the diagonal elements at [i][i] and [i][n - 1 - i].
2. Check if these diagonal elements are zero or non-zero based on the problem description.

Here's the revised code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkXMatrix(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((i == j || i + j == n - 1) && grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    return false; // If the diagonal elements are zero, return false.
                } else if (i != j && i + j != n - 1 && grid[i][j] != 0) {
                    return false; // If non-diagonal elements are non-zero, return false.
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this modified code, the condition for checking the non-zero diagonal elements is updated to `if ((i == j || i + j == n - 1) && grid[i][j] == 0)`, and the condition to check non-zero elements at non-diagonal positions is updated to `else if (i != j && i + j != n - 1 && grid[i][j] != 0)`.
