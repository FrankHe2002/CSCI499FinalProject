The code aims to find the index with the minimum average difference of the given array. Upon reviewing the code, it seems that there are several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The computation of the averages and differences has incorrect logic.
2. There are unnecessary calculations and variables used in the loop.
3. The use of long and integer division is creating potentially erroneous results.
4. There is a syntax error in the line `suml += nums[i;` which causes a compilation error.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumAverageDifference(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int idx = -1;
        long min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        long suml = nums[0];
        long sumr = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sumr += nums[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            long diff = Math.abs((suml / (i + 1)) - (sumr / (nums.length - i - 1)));
            if (diff < min) {
                min = diff;
                idx = i;
            }
            suml += nums[i + 1];
            sumr -= nums[i + 1];
        }
        return idx;
    }
}
```

In the modified code:
1. The calculation of the average difference has been modified to correctly compute the averages and differences using the cumulative sum.
2. The unnecessary variables `calc`, `left`, `right`, and `arr` have been removed.
3. The division is now performed within the loop and correctly using `i + 1` and `nums.length - i - 1`.
4. The syntax error in the line `suml += nums[i;` has been corrected to `suml += nums[i + 1];`.

The modified code should now be free of the identified issues and should correctly find the index with the minimum average difference of the given array.
