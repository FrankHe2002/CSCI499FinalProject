The code appears to be implementing a magical string generator and then counting the number of 1s in the first n strings generated. Let's review the code starting from the `next()` method in the `Magical` class.

1. In the `next()` method, it seems the logic for generating the next magical string is incorrect. The logic inside the `if` block appears to be faulty, and the conditional decrement of `n` seems to be incorrect as well. We need to fix the logic for generating the magical string.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n <= 3) return 1;
        Magical m = new Magical();
        int ans = 1;
        for (int i = 3; i < n; ++i)
            if (m.next() == 1)
                ++ans;
        return ans;
    }
}

class Magical {

    private StringBuilder sb;
    private int head = 2;

    public Magical() {
        sb = new StringBuilder("122");
    }

    public int next() {
        int val = sb.charAt(head - 1) - '0';
        if (head == sb.length()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < sb.charAt(head) - '0'; i++)
                sb.append(val);
            head++;
        } else {
            head++;
        }
        return val;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- We fixed the `next()` method to accurately generate the magical strings considering the occurrence of '1's and '2's.
- The logic for generating the magical string follows the instructions provided in the problem. Each number generated is concatenated in a special way, simulating the magical string generation process.

The code is now fixed and should work as intended.
