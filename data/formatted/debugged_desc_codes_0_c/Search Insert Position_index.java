The bug in the given code is in the if conditions. The conditions for comparing the target with the middle element of the array are incorrect. Also, the initial value of `ans` is not being used for returning the index.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. In the while loop, correct the conditions to compare the target with `nums[mid]` instead of `nums[2]`.
2. Use the `ans` variable to store the index and return it at the end.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        int ans = 0;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (target < nums[mid]) {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
            else if (target > nums[mid]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```
