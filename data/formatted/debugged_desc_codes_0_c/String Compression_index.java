The bug in the code is with the while loop condition `while (j < chars.length && chars[chars] == chars[i])`. It should be `while (j < chars.length && chars[j] == chars[i])` to compare the characters in the array.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int index = 0;
        int i = 0;

        while (i < chars.length) {
            int j = i;

            while (j < chars.length && chars[j] == chars[i]) {
                j++;
            }

            chars[index++] = chars[i];

            if (j - i > 1) {
                String count = String.valueOf(j - i);

                for (char c : count.toCharArray()) {
                    chars[index++] = c;
                }
            }

            i = j;
        }

        return index;
    }
}
```

By fixing the loop condition, we are comparing the correct characters and counting their occurrences accurately. Additionally, using `String.valueOf` instead of `"" +` provides better performance and readability. This fix allows the algorithm to correctly compress the array of characters according to the given algorithm.
