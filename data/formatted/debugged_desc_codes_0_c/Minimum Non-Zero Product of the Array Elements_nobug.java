Bug Type:
The code may produce incorrect results due to potential integer overflow because the variable mx is being calculated as a long but the result of the multiplication is being stored in an integer.

Reasoning:
1. The value of mx is calculated using Math.pow(2, p), which returns a double.
2. Then, it is cast to a long which could lead to precision issues.
3. The result of the multiplication is cast to an int, which could result in overflow if the product is larger than the maximum value for an int.

The fix would be to cast the product to a long to prevent overflow.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int mod = 1_000_000_007;

    public int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {
        if (p == 1) return 1;

        long mx = (long) (Math.pow(2, p)) - 1;
        long sm = mx - 1;
        long n = sm / 2;
        long sum = rec(sm, n);

        return (int) ((sum * (mx % mod)) % mod);
    }

    public long rec(long val, long n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return (val % mod);

        long newVal = ((val % mod) * (val % mod)) % mod;

        if (n % 2 != 0) {
            return ((rec(newVal, n / 2) % mod) * (val % mod)) % mod;
        }

        return rec(newVal, n / 2) % mod;
    }
}
```
