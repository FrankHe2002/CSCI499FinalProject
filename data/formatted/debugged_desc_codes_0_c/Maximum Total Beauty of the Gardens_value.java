There seems to be an issue in the logic used to calculate the maximum total beauty. 

Let's start by identifying the approach used in the code. It seems that the code is calculating the total beauty by considering the number of complete gardens multiplied by full, and the minimum number of flowers in an incomplete garden multiplied by partial.

Now, let's identify the bug type by reviewing the code:

1. It seems that the calculation of prefix values is incorrect. The indexing used in the prefix array is causing potential issues.
2. The while loop condition and logic inside the loop seem to be complex and may not be correct in capturing the required behavior for the given problem.

To fix the bug, we will change the indexing and the logic of the while loop a bit. We will update the prefix array calculations and update the while loop condition for better clarity.

Here's the revised code with minimal changes:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long maximumBeauty(int[] flowers, long newFlowers, int target, int full, int partial) {
        int n = flowers.length;
        long[] prefix = new long[n + 1];
        Arrays.sort(flowers);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + Math.max(flowers[i] - target, 0);
        long res = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int c = 0; c <= n; ++c) {
            long remain = prefix[n] - prefix[n - c] + newFlowers - c * (long) target;
            if (remain < 0) break;
            long min = 0;
            if (c < n) {
                min = Long.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int i = 0; i <= n - c - 1; i++) {
                    long sum = prefix[i + c + 1] - prefix[i];
                    long required = target * (i + 1) - sum;
                    long extra = remain - required;
                    min = Math.min(min, flowers[i + c] + Math.max(extra, 0) / (i + 1));
                }
            }
            res = Math.max(res, c * (long) full + min * (long) partial);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, the prefix array indexing was updated, and the while loop condition was replaced with a for loop to capture the required logic. Additionally, the calculations inside the for loop were updated to better address the incomplete gardens' conditions for a more accurate solution.
