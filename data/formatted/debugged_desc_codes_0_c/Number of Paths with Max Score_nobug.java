The code first initializes some variables and 2D arrays, then iterates through the board to calculate the maximum sum of numeric characters and the number of paths to reach the top left square while avoiding obstacles.

Upon reviewing the code, I noticed a potential issue in the loop iterating through the board. When comparing the sum of numeric characters and the current maximum sum (`dp[i][j]`), in one of the conditions the value of `ways` is always being assigned to 0, although it should be the same as `ways[x][y]`.

The issue is with the following lines of code:
```java
if (cur + dp[x][y] > dp[i][j]) {
    dp[i][j] = cur + dp[x][y];
    ways[i][j] = 0; // This line should be removed or commented out.
}
```

The fix involves removing or commenting out the line that assigns 0 to `ways[i][j]`, but let's now make the necessary changes. 

```java
// Runtime: 42 ms (Top 12.33%) | Memory: 44.2 MB (Top 60.27%)
class Solution {
    public int[] pathsWithMaxScore(List<String> board) {
        int M = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        int m = board.size();
        int n = board.get(0).length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        int[][] ways = new int[m][n];
        ways[0][0] = 1; // base case.
        int[][] dirs = {{-1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, -1}}; // all 3 ways where we can travel.
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board.get(i).charAt(j) == 'X') {
                    continue;
                }
                int cur = Character.isDigit(board.get(i).charAt(j)) ? board.get(i).charAt(j) - '0' : 0;
                for (int[] d : dirs) {
                    int x = d[0] + i;
                    int y = d[1] + j;
                    if (x < 0 || y < 0 || ways[x][y] == 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (cur + dp[x][y] > dp[i][j]) {
                        dp[i][j] = cur + dp[x][y];
                    }
                    if (cur + dp[x][y] == dp[i][j]) {
                        ways[i][j] += ways[x][y];
                        ways[i][j] %= M;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{dp[m - 1][n - 1], ways[m - 1][n - 1]};
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by removing the line `ways[i][j] = 0;`. This issue was causing the incorrect computation of the number of paths with the maximum sum of numeric characters.
