The code seems to have an off-by-one bug. It should be incrementing the count as the algorithm goes through the array, but currently, it is initialized with -1. This causes the count to be off by one and potentially leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, in the for loop, we should initialize `count` to 0 instead of -1, and increment it after each operation. It should also handle the case when `num > nums[i]` correctly to calculate the number of operations needed to make `num` smaller or equal to `nums[i]` and also to handle the edge case when `num` needs to be updated.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }

        int count = 0; // Fixed
        int num = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (num >= nums[i]) { // Fixed
                count += num - nums[i] + 1; // Fixed
                num++; // Fixed
            } else {
                num = nums[i];
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
