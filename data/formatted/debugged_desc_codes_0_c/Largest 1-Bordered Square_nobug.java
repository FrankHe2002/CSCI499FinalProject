The given Java code seems to be mostly correct, but it might have a logical issue in the `getD` method. 

The `getD` method is supposed to calculate the dimension of the largest square with all 1s on its borders based on the information in the `rows` and `cols` arrays. 

Upon reviewing the code, it seems like the logic is correct. However, there is a potential issue in the `getD` method.

In the `getD` method, the loop should iterate from `len` down to 1 (since we need to find the largest square), but the current implementation is from `1` to `len`. This loop should be fixed to iterate from `len` down to `1`.

Below is the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int largest1BorderedSquare(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        // rows[r][c] is the length of the line ended at [r,c] on row r
        int[][] rows = new int[m][n];
        // the length of the line ended at [r,c] on column c
        int[][] cols = new int[m][n];
        int res = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r < m; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == 0) {
                    rows[r][c] = 0;
                    cols[r][c] = 0;
                } else {
                    rows[r][c] = c == 0 ? 1 : rows[r][c - 1] + 1;
                    cols[r][c] = r == 0 ? 1 : cols[r - 1][c] + 1;
                    if (res >= rows[r][c] || res >= cols[r][c]) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    res = Math.max(res, getD(rows, cols, r, c));
                }
            }
        }
        return res * res;
    }
    
    // get the dimension of the largest square which bottom-right point is [row, col]
    private int getD(int[][] rows, int[][] cols, int row, int col) {
        int len = Math.min(rows[row][col], cols[row][col]);
        for (int i = len; i >= 1; i--) { // Fix: iterate from len down to 1
            if (rows[row - i + 1][col] >= i && cols[row][col - i + 1] >= i) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

The issue in the `getD` method is addressed by changing the loop to iterate from `len` down to `1`. Now, the code should work as intended without logical issues.
