The code provided is attempting to solve the problem of scheduling a list of jobs in d days with the minimum difficulty for a job schedule. The code is using a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

Upon reviewing the code, I can see that there is a typo on line 36: `memod][idx] = res;`. It should be `memo[d][idx] = res;`.

So, the bug in the code is a typographical error.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    // Given an array, cut it into d contiguous subarray and return the minimum sum of max of each subarray.
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        if (d > jobDifficulty.length) {
            return -1;
        }

        int[][] memo = new int[d + 1][jobDifficulty.length];
        for (int[] m : memo) {
            Arrays.fill(m, -1);
        }

        return getMinDays(jobDifficulty, d, memo, 0);
    }

    private int getMinDays(int[] jobDifficulty, int d, int[][] memo, int idx) {
        if (d == 1) {
            int max = 0;
            while (idx < jobDifficulty.length) {
                max = Math.max(max, jobDifficulty[idx]);
                idx++;
            }
            return max;
        }

        if (memo[d][idx] != -1) return memo[d][idx];

        int max = 0;
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        // [6,5,4,3,2,1], d=5 => we don't want the cut at 4th position in the array because we won't be able to divide it into 5 parts
        for (int i = idx; i < jobDifficulty.length - d + 1; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, jobDifficulty[i]);
            res = Math.min(res, max + getMinDays(jobDifficulty, d - 1, memo, i + 1));
        }

        memo[d][idx] = res;
        return memo[d][idx];
    }
}
```
