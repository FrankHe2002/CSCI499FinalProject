The bug in the code is in the for loops that are supposed to calculate the total after removing the smallest and largest 5% of the elements.

Let's analyze and fix the code step by step:

1. The variable `toRemove` is correctly calculated as 5% of the length of the array.

2. After sorting the array, we need to calculate the total by summing all elements. This part is correct.

3. The problem arises in the next for loops. It seems to be attempting to multiply or subtract the value of `total` with the elements at indices `i`, which is not the correct approach for removing the smallest and largest 5% of elements.

4. The second and third for loops should be logically swapping the desired elements according to the intended task.

5. We need to fix the area where the removal of the elements is actually taking place.

Here's the revised code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public double trimMean(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int length = arr.length;
        int toRemove = length * 5 / 100;
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = toRemove; i < length - toRemove; i++) {
            total += arr[i];
        }
        length = length - 2 * toRemove;
        return (double) ((double) total / (double) length);
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
1. The for loop correctly sums the elements between the indices `toRemove` and `length - toRemove`.

2. The length is updated after removing the elements, which simplifies the average calculation.

This fix correctly addresses the logic for removing the smallest and largest 5% of elements and should handle the task as intended.
