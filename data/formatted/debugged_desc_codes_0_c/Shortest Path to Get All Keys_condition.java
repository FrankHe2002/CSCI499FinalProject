Bug Type:
The bug in the given Java code is in the `equals` method of the `State` class. The condition for equality comparison is incorrect.

Reasoning:
The `equals` method in the `State` class compares the `i` and `j` coordinates but neglects to compare the `keys`. This can result in incorrect equality comparison due to the wrong implementation of the condition.

Fix:
Update the `equals` method in the `State` class to correctly compare the `i`, `j`, and `keys` coordinates.

Updated Code:
```java
class State {
    public int i, j, keys;

    public State(int i, int j, int keys) {
        this.i = i;
        this.j = j;
        this.keys = keys;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (! (obj instanceof State)) return false;
        State that = (State) obj;
        return i == that.i && j == that.j && keys == that.keys; // Corrected comparison
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int prime = 31;
        int hash = 1;
        hash = hash * prime + i;
        hash = hash * prime + j;
        hash = hash * prime + keys;
        return hash;
    }
}
```
