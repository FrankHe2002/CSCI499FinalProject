Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
1. The original graph is given as an undirected graph with the number of nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
2. The code is trying to calculate the number of nodes that are reachable from node 0 in the new graph after subdividing each edge.
3. The code uses a PriorityQueue to keep track of the nearest node with the maximum moves remaining.

Identified logical error:
When checking for reachable nodes, the code reduces the number of moves remaining on a specific edge, but the reduction applies to all nodes connected to that edge, which is causing the result to be incorrect.

Fix:
To fix this issue, the reduction in the number of moves remaining should be specific to each edge and not be applied to all connected nodes at once. The reduction should also be based on the shortest path from node 0 to the current node.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int reachableNodes(int[][] edges, int maxMoves, int n) {
        int[][] graph = new int[n][n];
        for (int[] t : graph) {
            Arrays.fill(t, -1);
        }
        for (int[] t : edges) {
            graph[t[0]][t[1]] = t[2];
            graph[t[1]][t[0]] = t[2];
        }
        PriorityQueue<int[]> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        int ans = 0;
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[n];
        heap.offer(new int[] {0, maxMoves});
        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] info = heap.poll();
            int nearestNodeId = info[0];
            int maxMovesRemaining = info[1];
            if (vis[nearestNodeId]) {
                continue;
            }
            vis[nearestNodeId] = true;
            ans++;

            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (graph[nearestNodeId][i] != -1) {
                    if (!vis[i]) {
                        int movesUsed = Math.min(maxMovesRemaining, graph[nearestNodeId][i]);
                        ans += movesUsed;

                        if (maxMovesRemaining >= graph[nearestNodeId][i]) {
                            heap.offer(new int[]{i, maxMovesRemaining - graph[nearestNodeId][i] - 1});
                        }

                        graph[nearestNodeId][i] -= movesUsed;
                        graph[i][nearestNodeId] -= movesUsed;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
