The bug in the given Java code is in the `search` method. The condition for updating `start` and `end` variables based on the comparison of `target` with `nums[mid]` needs to be modified to handle the `target` match correctly and divide the search array into two parts effectively.

Here is the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] ans = {-1, -1};
        int start = search(nums, target, true);
        int end = search(nums, target, false);
        if (start <= end) {
            ans[0] = start;
            ans[1] = end;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    int search(int[] nums, int target, boolean findStart) {
        int ans = -1;
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (target > nums[mid] || (findStart && target == nums[mid])) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
            if (target == nums[mid]) {
                ans = mid;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. The condition for updating `start` and `end` variables in the `search` method is modified to handle the `target` match correctly and ensure the division of the search array into two parts effectively.

2. Additionally, a check is added in the `searchRange` method to ensure the start index is not greater than the end index before setting the answer array.

The bug is fixed, and the algorithm now has O(log n) runtime complexity.
