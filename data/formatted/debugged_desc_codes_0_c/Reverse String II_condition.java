Upon reviewing the code, the following bugs are identified:
1. The condition in the for loop is incorrect.
2. The reversal of the substring is incorrect.
3. The usage of StringBuilder is not efficient.

To fix these bugs, the following changes will be made:
1. In the for loop, update the condition where it should be i + 2 * k <= s.length().
2. Remove the unnecessary StringBuilder object creation and usage.
3. Modify the logic within the loop to reverse every k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

Here's the updated code with the fixes:

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        char[] ch = s.toCharArray();
        char temp;
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 2 * k) {
            for (j = i, k = Math.min(i + k - 1, s.length() - 1); j < k; j++, k--) {
                temp = ch[j];
                ch[j] = ch[k];
                ch[k] = temp;
            }
        }
        return new String(ch);
    }
}
```
