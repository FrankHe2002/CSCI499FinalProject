The code looks correct at first glance, but a bug is introduced by not handling the first word properly when appending "ma" to the end and adding "a" based on the word index. Since the "temp" stringbuffer already starts with "a", we should not append an extra "a" for the first word in the sentence. 

I will modify the code so that it does not add an extra "a" for the first word in the sentence.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String toGoatLatin(String sentence) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        StringBuffer temp = new StringBuffer("a");
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");

        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (beginsWithConsonant(words[i])) {
                sb.append(words[i].substring(1));
                sb.append(words[i].charAt(0));
            } else {
                sb.append(words[i]);
            }

            sb.append("ma");
            if (i != 0) {
                sb.append(temp);
            }
            temp.append("a");
            sb.append(" ");
        }

        return sb.toString().trim();
    }

    public boolean beginsWithConsonant(String str) {
        return "aeiou".indexOf(str.toLowerCase().charAt(0)) == -1;
    }
}
```

I added an if condition to check if the current word is the first word in the sentence before appending "a" based on the word index. If it's the first word, we don't append "a" from the "temp" stringbuffer.
