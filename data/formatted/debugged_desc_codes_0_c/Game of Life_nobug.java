The code provided takes a 2D array representing the current state of a board, applies the rules of Conway's Game of Life, and returns the next state.

One potential issue in the code is that the constraint of solving the problem in-place is not being followed, as a new 2D array `next` is created to store the next state of the board.

To fix this issue, we should store the next state in the original `board` array instead of creating a new one. This can be achieved by taking advantage of the fact that the binary representation of a cell can be updated in such a way that its previous and next state can be differentiated.

Here is the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int lives = liveNeighbors(board, i, j, m, n);
                if(board[i][j] == 1 && lives >= 2 && lives <= 3)
                    board[i][j] = 3;  // Make the cell 1 -> 3, representing the cell is live in both states.
                if(board[i][j] == 0 && lives == 3)
                    board[i][j] = 2; // Make the cell 0 -> 2, representing the cell is dead in current state but live in next state.
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                board[i][j] >>= 1;  // Change the cells to their next state by shifting bits.
            }
        }
    }

    public int liveNeighbors(int[][] board, int i, int j, int m, int n) {
        int lives = 0;
        for (int x = i - 1; x <= i + 1; x++) {
            for (int y = j - 1; y <= j + 1; y++) {
                if (x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n) {
                    lives += board[x][y] & 1; // take only rightmost bit to check the current state by using bit manipulation.
                }
            }
        }
        lives -= board[i][j] & 1; // Subtract the current cell's state, because it has already been accounted for in the loop above.
        return lives;
    }
}
