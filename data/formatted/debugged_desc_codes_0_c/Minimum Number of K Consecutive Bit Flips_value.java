The given code is supposed to return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array. If it is not possible, the code should return -1.

Bug:
1. In the for loop, the condition `for (int i = -1; i < nums.length; i++)` is incorrect. It should start from 0 instead of -1 as array indices start from 0.

2. In the if condition `if (i < nums.length - k + 1 && nums[i] == target)`, `nums[i]` should be `nums[i+1]` as the current algorithm is always evaluating the position before k which makes the algorithm incorrect.

3. There seems to be an additional semicolon after the declaration of the `ans` variable.

4. The condition `if (i > nums.length - k && nums[i] == target)` is incorrect as it should check the condition for `i > nums.length - k - 1` to avoid array index out of bounds exception.

5. The `(Top 24.69%)` and `(Top 76.54%)` comments are not needed and don't affect the functionality of the code.

Here's the updated code with fixes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minKBitFlips(int[] nums, int k) {
        int target = 0, ans = 0;
        boolean[] flip = new boolean[nums.length + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (flip[i]) {
                target ^= 1;
            }
            if (i <= nums.length - k && nums[i] == target) {
                target ^= 1;
                flip[i + k] ^= true;
                ans++;
            }
            if (i > nums.length - k && nums[i] == target) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
