The given code is calculating the number of nodes in the tree using a recursive postorder traversal. The code logic appears to be correct, but the bug is that the TreeNode class definition has an error in the constructor.

Here is the corrected TreeNode class definition:
```java
// Define the TreeNode class
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    
    // Constructor
    TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}
```

The original TreeNode class definition in the given code has a syntax error in the third constructor where '%' was used instead of '}'. This syntax error needs to be fixed.

The corrected Solution class remains the same:
```java
// Define the Solution class
class Solution {

    static int count = 0;

    // Postorder traversal
    static void Postorder(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        Postorder(root.left);
        Postorder(root.right);
        count++;
    }

    // Method to count nodes in the binary tree
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        count = 0;
        Postorder(root);
        return count;
    }
}
```

The main change made was to correct the syntax error in the TreeNode class. After redefining the TreeNode class correctly, the Solution class for counting the nodes in the binary tree remains the same.
