Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The code calculates the sum of divisors of each number in the array and checks if it has exactly four divisors. The bug may occur due to an incorrect count of divisors or a mistake in the logic of calculating divisors.

I will verify the code logic for counting divisors and finding the sum of divisors to identify and fix the bug.

First, I'll review the logic used to count divisors and find the sum of divisors.

If the logic for count, and sum, is incorrect, then I will modify the logic to correctly handle the count and sum of divisors while iterating through the array elements.

Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumFourDivisors(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i * i <= val; i++) {
                if (val % i == 0) {
                    if (i * i != val) {
                        sum += i + val / i;
                        count += 2;
                    } else {
                        sum += i;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (count == 4) {
                res += sum;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
