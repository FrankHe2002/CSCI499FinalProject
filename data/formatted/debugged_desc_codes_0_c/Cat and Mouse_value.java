The bug in the given code is a typo when checking if the game is over. There are incorrect uses of the bitwise AND operator (``&``) and the comparison operators (``>`` and ``==``), along with an incorrect use of the bitwise OR operator (``|``). 

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for thinking about the changes:
1. The comparison between time and 1 should be performed with the bitwise AND operator, using ``time & 1 == 0`` to check if it's the mouse's turn and ``time & 1 == 1`` to check if it's the cat's turn.
2. There's a typo at line 25 where the condition should use the bitwise AND operator ``(state & 2) == 2`` and not the comparison operator.
3. In a similar way, the bitwise XOR operator should be used while updating the state at line 21.
4. Later, while checking if the game is over, the bitwise AND and OR operators should be used within parentheses to avoid incorrect precedence and to ensure that the conditions evaluate properly.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
// Runtime: 911 ms (Top 7.06%) | Memory: 70.7 MB (Top 63.53%)
class Solution {
    int TIME_MAX = 200;
    int DRAW = 0;
    int MOUSE_WIN = 1;
    int CAT_WIN = 2;

    public int catMouseGame(int[][] graph) {
        return dfs(0, new int[] {1, 2}, graph, new Integer[TIME_MAX + 1][graph.length][graph.length]);
    }

    private int dfs(int time, int[] p, int[][] graph, Integer[][][] memo) { // p[0] -> mouse position, p[1] -> cat position
        Integer old = memo[time][p[0]][p[1]];
        if (old != null) return old; // all the base cases here
        if (time >= TIME_MAX) return DRAW;
        if (p[0] == 0) return MOUSE_WIN;
        if (p[0] == p[1]) return CAT_WIN;
        int state = 0;
        int where = p[time & 1];
        int res = DRAW;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph[where].length; i++) {
            if (((time & 1) == 0 || graph[where][i] > 0)) { // if mouse turn or cat turn and the dest is not 0, do ...
                p[time & 1] = graph[where][i];
                state ^= (1 << dfs(time + 1, p, graph, memo)); // Use XOR to update state
                if (((time & 1) == 1 && (state & 4) == 4) || ((time & 1) == 0 && (state & 2) == 2)) { // if cat's turn & cat win or mouse's turn & mouse win, then we stop.
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        p[time & 1] = where; // restore p
        if (((time & 1) == 1 && (state & 4) == 4) || ((time & 1) == 0) && (state == 4)) {
            res = CAT_WIN; // cat win when it's cat's turn and cat win or it's mouse's turn and the state is cat
        } else if (((time & 1) == 0 && (state & 2) == 2) || ((time & 1) == 1 && state == 2)) {
            res = MOUSE_WIN; // mouse win when its mouse's turn and mouse win or it's cat's turn and the state is mouse
        }
        return memo[time][p[0]][p[1]] = res;
    }
}
