The given code is a naive approach to solve the problem. The problem with the code is that the radius calculation `radius2(point, queries[i])` and the comparison condition `if (radius2(point, queries[i]) <= radius2)` is incorrect. The radius calculation should be between the point and the center of the circle.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 42.1 MB (Top 96.08%)

class Solution {
    public int[] countPoints(int[][] points, int[][] queries) {
        int len = queries.length;
        int[] ans = new int[len];

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int p = 0; p < points.length; p++) {
                if (isInsideCircle(points[p], queries[i])) {
                    count += 1;
                }
            }
            ans[i] = count;
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private boolean isInsideCircle(int[] point, int[] query) {
        int x = point[0] - query[0];
        int y = point[1] - query[1];
        int radius2 = query[2] * query[2];
        return x * x + y * y <= radius2;
    }
}
```
