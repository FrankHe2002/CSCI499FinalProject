Bug:
The bug is identified in Solution 1 of the provided code. 

Reasoning:
In Solution 1, the bug is in the loop condition for indexing the input array 'indices'. The loop should iterate over the length of 'indices' array. However, in the current code, the loop condition < indices.length is the cause of the bug. The code also incorrectly attempts to access indices[i + 2][0] and indices[i][1], which will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:
1. Update the loop condition to iterate over the correct range of 'indices' array, i.e., indices.length.
2. Access the correct indices for row and column from the 'indices' array.

The corrected code for Solution 1 will be:

```java
// --------------------- Solution 1 ---------------------
class Solution {
    public int oddCells(int m, int n, int[][] indices) {
        int[][] matrix = new int[m][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
            int row = indices[i][0];
            int col = indices[i][1];

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                matrix[row][j]++;
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                matrix[j][col]++;
            }
        }

        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] % 2 != 0) {
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }

        return counter;
    }
}
```

The bug is fixed in the Solution 1 code. Solution 2 is also a valid and correct solution to the problem.
