The code provided aims to return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree. 

Identifying the bug:

1. The array references are incorrect, as it is trying to access element `node` in the `left` array instead of the first element.
2. The comparison `currSum / currCount == node.val` may not accurately compare the average of the subtree with the node value due to integer division potentially rounding down.

Fixing the bug:
I will correct the array references and perform the average calculation using floating point numbers to avoid the issue of rounding down during integer division.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    int res = 0;

    public int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return res;
    }

    private int[] dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return new int[] {0, 0};
        }

        int[] left = dfs(node.left);
        int[] right = dfs(node.right);

        int currSum = left[0] + right[0] + node.val;
        int currCount = left[1] + right[1] + 1;

        if ((double) currSum / currCount == node.val) {
            res++;
        }

        return new int[] {currSum, currCount};
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, `left[node]` is changed to `left[0]` and `right[0]` to access the sum of the subtree.  Then, the average calculation is performed with `(double) currSum / currCount`.
