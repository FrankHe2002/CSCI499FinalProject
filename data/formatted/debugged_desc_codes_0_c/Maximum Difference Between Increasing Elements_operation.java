The given Java code seems to be working fine for the problem statement. There are no apparent syntax errors or logical flaws.

The code initializes the result to Integer.MIN_VALUE and the minValue to the first element of the array. Then, it iterates through the array and updates the result and minValue based on the conditions given in the problem statement. Finally, it returns the result or -1 if result is still equal to Integer.MIN_VALUE.

After reviewing the code logic, no bug has been identified.

The code seems to efficiently find the maximum difference between two elements in the array while adhering to the given constraints.

The running time and memory usage are optimized as well.

Therefore, the code is correct, and no bug fix or minimal changes are needed.

The code can be formatted in markdown as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumDifference(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 2)
            return -1;
        int result = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int minValue = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > minValue)
                result = Math.max(result, nums[i] - minValue);
            minValue = Math.min(minValue, nums[i]);
        }
        return result == Integer.MIN_VALUE ? -1 : result;
    }
}
```
