Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a Stack to store the elements of the nums array, which is unnecessary for solving the problem and adds extra space complexity.
2. The code sorts the array, which has a time complexity of O(n log n), violating the requirement of linear runtime complexity.

Identified bug:
The logic used to identify the single number is flawed. The code is not correctly identifying the single number in the array.

Fix:
I will remove the usage of Stack and the sorting of the array. Instead, I will use XOR operation to find the single number, which has a time complexity of O(n) and constant space complexity.

Updated code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms | Memory: 38.7 MB
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int singleNumber = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            singleNumber ^= num;
        }
        return singleNumber;
    }
}
```
