Bug type: Logic Bug

Reasoning:
1. The update method incorrectly updates the current_record regardless of the timestamp order. It should only update the current_record if the new timestamp is greater than the current_record's timestamp.
2. The maximum and minimum methods have an incorrect logic for finding the maximum and minimum prices.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Update the update method to check if the new timestamp is greater than the current_record's timestamp before updating.
2. Modify the maximum and minimum methods to ensure that the peeked StockRecord from the priority queue matches the price stored in the map.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class StockRecord {
    int timestamp;
    int price;

    public StockRecord() {
    }

    public StockRecord(int t, int p) {
        timestamp = t;
        price = p;
    }
}

class StockPrice {

    PriorityQueue<StockRecord> max = new PriorityQueue<>((sr1, sr2) -> (sr2.price - sr1.price));
    PriorityQueue<StockRecord> min = new PriorityQueue<>((sr1, sr2) -> (sr1.price - sr2.price));
    StockRecord current_record;
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();


    public StockPrice() {
        current_record = new StockRecord(-1, 0); // Initialize with a default timestamp and price
    }

    public void update(int timestamp, int price) {
        if (timestamp >= current_record.timestamp) {
            current_record.timestamp = timestamp;
            current_record.price = price;
        }

        StockRecord sr = new StockRecord(timestamp, price);
        max.add(sr);
        min.add(sr);
        map.put(timestamp, price);
    }

    public int current() {
        return current_record.price;
    }

    public int maximum() {
        StockRecord sp = max.peek();
        while (sp.price != map.get(sp.timestamp)) {
            max.poll();
            sp = max.peek();
        }
        return sp.price;
    }

    public int minimum() {
        StockRecord sp = min.peek();
        while (sp.price != map.get(sp.timestamp)) {
            min.poll();
            sp = min.peek();
        }
        return sp.price;
    }
}
```
