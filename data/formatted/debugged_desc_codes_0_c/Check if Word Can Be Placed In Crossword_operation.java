Bug type:
The bug seems to be logic-related.

Reasoning:
The code is intended to determine whether a given word can be placed in the crossword puzzle. It is achieving this by checking if the word exists in the Trie data structure, which is constructed from all the horizontal and vertical strings in the board. The code uses a recursive helper method called `helper` to search for the word in the Trie.

The bug occurs in the `isPresent` method of the `Trie` class. In this method, the `helper` method is being called with both `curr.children.get(c)` and `curr.children.get(' ')`. This will always return `true` if either of the two calls find a match, which seems incorrect. Additionally, the `insertIntoTrie` helper method constructs the Trie by inserting the reverse of every string as an attempt to consider horizontal as well as vertical words. This approach is logical but may not be efficient or may introduce confusion in checking the Trie for the target word.

The bug lies in the `isPresent` method's `helper` function.
Additionally, the traversing logic for horizontal and vertical components need restructuring for efficiency.

I will fix the recursion within the `helper` method to correctly handle checking for the Trie by excluding checking for the `blank` condition when traversing the Trie. Furthermore, I will modify the traversing logic and Trie construction for the horizontal strings and vertical strings to uniquely differentiate mappings of the horizontal and vertical words.

I will also suggest some optimizations to improve runtime and memory usage.

Updated code:

```java
// Runtime: TBA | Memory: TBA
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean placeWordInCrossword(char[][] board, String word) {
        Trie horizontalTrie = new Trie();
        Trie verticalTrie = new Trie();

        // Construct horizontal Trie
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '#') {
                    if (sb.length() > 0) {
                        horizontalTrie.insert(sb.toString());
                    }
                    sb.setLength(0);
                } else {
                    sb.append(board[i][j]);
                }
            }
            if (sb.length() > 0) {
                horizontalTrie.insert(sb.toString());
            }
        }

        // Construct vertical Trie
        for (int i = 0; i < board[0].length; i++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for (int j = 0; j < board.length; j++) {
                if (board[j][i] == '#') {
                    if (sb.length() > 0) {
                        verticalTrie.insert(sb.toString());
                    }
                    sb.setLength(0);
                } else {
                    sb.append(board[j][i]);
                }
            }
            if (sb.length() > 0) {
                verticalTrie.insert(sb.toString());
            }
        }

        return horizontalTrie.isPresent(word) || verticalTrie.isPresent(word);
    }

    class TrieNode {
        Map<Character, TrieNode> children;
        boolean isEnd;

        TrieNode() {
            children = new HashMap<>();
            isEnd = false;
        }
    }

    class Trie {
        TrieNode root;

        Trie() {
            root = new TrieNode();
        }

        void insert(String s) {
            TrieNode curr = root;
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                if (!curr.children.containsKey(c)) {
                    curr.children.put(c, new TrieNode());
                }
                curr = curr.children.get(c);
            }
            curr.isEnd = true;
        }

        boolean isPresent(String key) {
            TrieNode curr = root;
            for (char c : key.toCharArray()) {
                if (!curr.children.containsKey(c)) {
                    return false;
                }
                curr = curr.children.get(c);
            }
            return curr.isEnd;
        }
    }
}
```

In the updated code:
1. The bug in the `isPresent` method's `helper` function has been fixed by replacing the recursion with a standard Trie search.
2. The Trie construction process for the horizontal and vertical strings has been updated to differentiate mappings of horizontal and vertical words separately for efficiency and correctness.
3. Some optimizations have been applied, such as using `StringBuilder` for constructing the strings and leveraging looping constructs for improved performance.
