The code looks correct at first glance, but there seems to be an issue in the `dfs` method where it checks if a node is visited or not. The bug seems to be at the line `if (visited[n.val] != null)`. This condition won't work as intended because the `visited` array is initialized with `null`, and the check should be for `visited[n.val] == null` to determine if the node is not visited.

To fix the issue, the if condition in the `dfs` method needs to be updated to compare with `null` instead of `!= null`.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void dfs(Node node, Node copy, Node[] visited) {
        visited[copy.val] = copy;

        for (Node n : node.neighbors) {
            if (visited[n.val] == null) {
                Node newNode = new Node(n.val);
                copy.neighbors.add(newNode);
                dfs(n, newNode, visited);
            } else {
                copy.neighbors.add(visited[n.val]);
            }
        }

    }

    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null; 
        Node copy = new Node(node.val);
        Node[] visited = new Node[101];
        Arrays.fill(visited, null);
        dfs(node, copy, visited);
        return copy;
    }
}
```

The issue has been fixed by updating the if condition in the `dfs` method.
