The code provided looks for the closest possible cost of the dessert to the target. The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to consider all possible combinations of ice cream base flavors and toppings to find the closest cost to the target.

Bug: The bug in the given code is in the DFS method where the indexing of the `toppingCosts` array is incorrect. It should use the `toppingIndex` and not `toppingIndex + 2` and `toppingIndex` for accessing the toppingCosts array.

Below is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 100.0%) | Memory: 39.60 MB (Top 90.1%)

class Solution {
    /**
     * Closest cost result
     */
    int closestCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    /**
     * Difference between closest cost result and target so far
     */
    int closestCostDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    public int closestCost(int[] baseCosts, int[] toppingCosts, int target) {
        for (int base : baseCosts) {
            dfs(toppingCosts, 0, base, target);
        }
        return closestCost;
    }

    public void dfs(int[] toppingCosts, int toppingIndex, int cost, int target) {
        int costDiff = Math.abs(target - cost);
        if (costDiff < closestCostDiff || (costDiff == closestCostDiff && cost < closestCost)) {
            closestCostDiff = costDiff;
            closestCost = cost;
        }

        // Since toppings are all positive cost, stop dfs early if cost exceeds target
        if (toppingIndex >= toppingCosts.length || cost > target)
            return;

        dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost, target);
        dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost + toppingCosts[toppingIndex], target);
        dfs(toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, cost + 2 * toppingCosts[toppingIndex], target);
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the indexing within the dfs method has been updated to `toppingIndex` to access the toppingCosts array, which resolves the bug and allows the code to correctly calculate the closest possible cost of the dessert to the target.
