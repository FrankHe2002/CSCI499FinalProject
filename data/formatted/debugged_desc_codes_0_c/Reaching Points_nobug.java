The given code uses a recursive approach to determine if it is possible to convert the point (sx, sy) to the point (tx, ty) through some operations. 

Upon initial observation of the code, it appears to take advantage of the fact that we can only reach a point (x, y) from the point (x - y, y) or (x, y - x), depending on the relation between x and y. 

While analyzing the code, it seems like the conditional checks for tx and ty can be incorrect. The conditions `tx < sx` and `ty < sy` should be `tx < sx || ty < sy` to account for the possible invalid inputs of `tx` and `ty` being at most `sx` and `sy`. 

The bug in the code is the conditional checks for `tx` and `ty`.

To fix this, the `reachingPoints` method should be used as is, but the conditional checks for `tx` and `ty` should be updated. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean reachingPoints(int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty) {
        if (sx == tx && sy == ty) {
            return true;
        }
        if (tx < sx || ty < sy) {
            return false;
        }
        return tx > ty ?
                reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx - ty, ty)
                : reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty - tx);
    }
}
```
