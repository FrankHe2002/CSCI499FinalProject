Potential Bug Type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
The given code simply checks if the string contains "01" and returns the negation of that result. However, this approach does not accurately determine if the binary string contains at most one contiguous segment of ones. It only checks for the presence of "01" in the string, which does not guarantee the correctness of the result.

Step-by-Step Fix:
1. We need to verify that the input string has a single contiguous segment of ones, and there may be zeroes before and after the segment.

2. We can fix the code by iterating through the string and checking for the first occurrence of '0' after the initial '1'. If another '1' is encountered after the first '0', then the string contains more than one contiguous segment of ones.

3. If the iteration completes without finding another '1' after the first '0', then there is only one contiguous segment of ones in the string.

4. We return true in the latter case and false otherwise.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkOnesSegment(String s) {
        boolean foundZero = false;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '0') {
                foundZero = true;
            } else if (s.charAt(i) == '1' && foundZero) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
