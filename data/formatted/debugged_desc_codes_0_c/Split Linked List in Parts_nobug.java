There are several issues in the provided code:
1. The conditions in the `while` loop are not checking for the `curr` node being null, which could lead to a `NullPointerException`.
2. The logic for splitting the list into parts is not considering all edge cases, especially when the list is shorter than `k` or when the length of the list is not divisible evenly by `k`.

To address these issues, the following changes should be made:
- Ensure that the conditions in the `while` loop check for the `curr` node being null.
- Modify the splitting logic to handle edge cases where the length of the list is not evenly divisible by `k`.

Here's the revised code with the necessary changes:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode[] splitListToParts(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode[] arr = new ListNode[k];

        int len = 0;
        ListNode temp = head;
        while (temp != null) {
            len++;
            temp = temp.next;
        }

        int extra = len % k;
        int partition = len / k;
        
        ListNode curr = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < k && curr != null; i++) {
            arr[i] = curr;
            int partSize = partition + (extra-- > 0 ? 1 : 0);
            for (int j = 0; j < partSize - 1; j++) {
                curr = curr.next;
            }
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = null;
            curr = next;
        }

        return arr;
    }
}
```
In this revised code:
- The length of the list is calculated first to determine the number of parts and the extra nodes.
- A single loop is used to partition the list and create the array of parts, while handling the edge cases for uneven partitioning based on the extra nodes.
