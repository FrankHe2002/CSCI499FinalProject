The code looks mostly correct, as it iterates through the string starting from the end and returns the largest-valued odd integer as a substring. However, there is potentially a bug in the condition `num.charAt(i) % 2 == 1`. Because `num.charAt(i)` returns a character and not a number, it should be converted to a number before performing the modulo operation. Otherwise, the condition checks if the ASCII value of the character is odd, not the actual digit.

To fix this issue, we need to convert the character to a number using `Character.getNumericValue()` before performing the modulo operation.

Here's the revised code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public String largestOddNumber(String num) {
        for (int i = num.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (Character.getNumericValue(num.charAt(i)) % 2 == 1) return num.substring(0, i + 1);
        }
        return "";
    }
}
```
