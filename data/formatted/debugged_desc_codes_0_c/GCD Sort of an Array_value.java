Bug type: Logical Error

The given code defines a Solution class with a gcdSort method that takes an integer array nums as input and attempts to sort it using a swap method based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements. The code calculates the GCD of each pair of elements and performs swaps based on the GCD values.

To identify the bug type, let's first understand the algorithm and the problem statement. The algorithm uses a precomputed array of prime numbers to group the elements in the input array based on their GCD values. If the elements have the same GCD, they are grouped together. Then, it checks if the elements are sorted after grouping.

Following are the identified changes to fix the logical error:

1. There is a logical error in the way that the code handles the grouping of elements based on their GCD. It uses an array to represent a grouping tree, but the code works with the numbers directly instead of the roots of the group. The root method should be used to resolve the group for each number.

2. The loop condition for iterating over primes needs to be updated to prevent iterating with a value greater than max / 2.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    private static final int[] primes;

    // precompute prime numbers
    static {
        primes = new int[5133];
        final int max = 100000 / 2;
        boolean[] notprime = new boolean[max];
        for (int index = 0, i = 2; i < max; i++) {
            if (notprime[i]) continue;
            primes[index++] = i;
            for (int j = (max - 1) / i; j >= 2; j--) notprime[i * j] = true;
        }
    }

    public boolean gcdSort(int[] nums) {
        final var sorted = nums.clone();
        Arrays.sort(sorted);
        final int len = nums.length, max = sorted[len - 1];
        final int[] map = new int[max + 1]; // grouping tree child->parent
        for (int i = 0; i <= max; i++) map[i] = i;

        for (final var p : primes) {
            if (p > max / 2) break;
            int group = p;
            for (int num = p; num <= max; num += p) {
                if (nums[num] != num) {
                    int root1 = root(map, num);
                    int root2 = root(map, group);
                    if (root1 < root2) {
                        map[root2] = root1;
                    } else {
                        map[root1] = root2;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) if (root(map, nums[i]) != root(map, sorted[i])) return false;
        return true;
    }

    private static int root(int[] map, int num) {
        while (num != map[num]) num = map[num];
        return num;
    }
}
```
