Bug type: Logical Error

The given Java code seems to have a logical error in the `sum` method of the `Fenwick` class. The issue is that the `sum` method should initialize the value of `i` to `i+1` instead of `i-1` when the sum of elements from 1 to `i` is being calculated. The loop condition should be changed accordingly to work with 1-based indexing.

Here's the updated Java code with the fix:

```java
class Fenwick {
    public int[] tree;  //Binary indexed Tree array

    //initialize a new Fenwick tree of size length
    public Fenwick(int length) {
        tree = new int[length + 1];  //update to accommodate 1-based indexing
    }

    //Returns the sum of values in an array from range [0, i]
    public int sum(int i) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (i > 0) {
            sum += tree[i];
            i = i - (i & -i);  //flip the last set bit using 2's compliment
        }
        return sum;
    }

    //Returns sum of values in the given range [start, end]
    public int sumRange(int start, int end) {
        return sum(end) - sum(start - 1);  //update to work with 1-based indexing
    }

    //updates the value at index i by "k" in tree
    public void update(int i, int k) {
        while (i < tree.length) {
            tree[i] += k;
            i = i + (i & -i);  //add last set bit
        }
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int createSortedArray(int[] instructions) {
        // existing implementation remains the same
    }
}
```

The logical error has been fixed by adding 1 to the `length` parameter of the `Fenwick` constructor to accommodate 1-based indexing, and updating the loop conditions in the `sum` and `sumRange` methods accordingly. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
