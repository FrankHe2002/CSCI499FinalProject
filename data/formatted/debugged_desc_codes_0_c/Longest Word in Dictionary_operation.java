Bug type:
Logical error

Reasoning:
1. The code is trying to build a Trie (Tire in the code) data structure to store the words.
2. In the `buildTire` method, the code is iterating through the characters of the input word and trying to create the Trie nodes. However, there are issues with the index calculation and the condition for creating a new node.
3. The index calculation for the character is incorrect (`int index = word.charAt(n - 1) % 'a';`). It should be `int index = word.charAt(n - 1) - 'a';`.
4. The condition for creating a new node if `temp.sub[index] == null` seems to be incorrect. It should be `if (temp.sub[index] == null) temp.sub[index] = new Node();` to create a new node at the index.
5. The check for the length of the current word with the length of `ans` is also incorrect. It should be `if (word.length() > ans.length())` since `ans` is a `StringBuilder`.

The following is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    private class Node {
        Node[] sub;

        Node() {
            sub = new Node[26];
        }
    }

    Node root;
    String ans; // Changed from StringBuilder to String

    private void buildTrie(String word) { // Corrected spelling of "Trie" from "Tire"
        Node temp = root;
        int n = word.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // Changed condition from n-1 to n
            int index = word.charAt(i) - 'a';
            if (temp.sub[index] == null) temp.sub[index] = new Node(); // Removed return statement
            temp = temp.sub[index];
        }

        if (word.length() > ans.length() || (word.length() == ans.length() && word.compareTo(ans) < 0)) {
            ans = word;
        }
    }

    public String longestWord(String[] words) {
        this.ans = ""; // Initialize ans with an empty string
        this.root = new Node();
        Arrays.sort(words); // Sort the array of words to ensure lexicographical order
        for (String word : words) buildTrie(word); // Use enhanced for loop
        return ans;
    }
}
```
The identified logical errors have been fixed in the code, and minimal changes have been applied to correct the bugs.
