The code finds the leftmost middle index in the array `nums` where the sum of the elements to the left of the middle index is equal to the sum of the elements to the right of the middle index. 

Potential bug type:
1. Logical error in finding the leftmost middle index.

To identify the bug, we need to understand the requirements and constraints, ensure that the code properly iterates through the array, and correctly calculates the left and right sums.

1. The code iterates through the array and correctly calculates both the left sum and right sum.
2. However, the code immediately returns the current index if the left sum is equal to the right sum without checking if it is the leftmost middle index.

Upon reviewing the code, the logical error is that the code returns the first middle index that satisfies the condition, but we need to return the leftmost middle index.

To fix the bug, I will modify the code to check for the leftmost middle index by storing the current leftmost middle index and its corresponding difference between the left and right sums.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMiddleIndex(int[] nums) {
        int leftSum = 0;
        int rightSum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            rightSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            rightSum -= nums[i];
            
            if (leftSum == rightSum) {
                return i;
            }
            
            leftSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, I modified the calculation of the right sum outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations. Then, within the loop, I first update the right sum and then compare the left and right sums, returning the leftmost middle index if the condition is satisfied.
