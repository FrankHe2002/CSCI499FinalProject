Bug: The implementation of the `buildRepeatList` method does not properly count repeating characters in the password. This could result in incorrect calculation of the number of replacements needed to make the password strong.

To identify this bug, focus on the `buildRepeatList` method specifically. Understand its purpose and then examine the logic to count repeating characters.

The `buildRepeatList` method is implemented to count the number of repeating characters in the password. However, upon reviewing the logic for counting repeats, it's observed that it does not correctly identify consecutive repeating characters.

Here's the issue: In the for loop inside `buildRepeatList`, the conditions used to check for repeating characters are comparing the current character with the previous one but ignoring the number of repeats. For instance, if a character appears three times consecutively, the logic will not correctly detect and account for this.

To fix this issue, update the `buildRepeatList` method to accurately track consecutive repeating characters.

```java
private List<Integer> buildRepeatList(String password) {
    List<Integer> repeats = new ArrayList<>();
    int i = 0;
    while (i < password.length()) {
        int j = i;
        while (j < password.length() && password.charAt(j) == password.charAt(i)) {
            j++;
        }
        repeats.add(j - i);  // Add the count of consecutive repeating characters
        i = j;
    }
    return repeats;
}
```

With this correction, the `buildRepeatList` method now correctly counts the number of consecutive repeating characters, allowing for accurate calculations of the number of replacements needed to make the password strong.

This change ensures that the code accurately identifies the repeating character patterns, addressing a potential bug in the original implementation.
