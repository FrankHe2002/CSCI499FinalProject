The identified bug in the code is a syntax error in the while loop condition on line 8. The condition should be `head != null` instead of `while head != null`.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public int numComponents(ListNode head, int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            set.add(nums[i]);
        }
        while (head != null) {
            if (set.contains(head.val)) {
                while (head.next != null && set.contains(head.next.val)) {
                    head = head.next;

                }
                count++;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

The fix involved changing the condition in the while loop from `head != null` to `while (head != null)`. This will ensure that the loop continues as long as the `head` is not null.
