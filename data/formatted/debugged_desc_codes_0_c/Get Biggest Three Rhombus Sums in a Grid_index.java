The code provided is a solution to the problem of finding the three biggest distinct rhombus sums in a given grid. The code seems to have multiple issues.

First, there seems to be a typo on line 22: `return new int[] {maxThree[edge]};`. It seems like "edge" should be replaced with "2" to access the third element of the array. 

Next, the logic to reverse the array using bitwise XOR operations on lines 32-34 may not yield the correct result. Since the task is to return the biggest three distinct rhombus sums in descending order, the array should be sorted in descending order. The code is currently attempting to reverse the array using bitwise operations which may not work for negative numbers and can also result in unexpected behavior. This issue should be addressed.

Finally, there seems to be a logical issue in the `addToMaxThree` function. Currently, this function only adds a new num to the maxThree array if it is greater than the first element of the array. This will not work as it will replace the smallest element in the array with the new num without sorting. The existing logic does not handle the case where the new num is greater than the second or third element in the array. This should be fixed to ensure that the biggest three distinct rhombus sums are identified correctly.

The code can be fixed as follows:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] getBiggestThree(int[][] grid) {
        int end = Math.min(grid.length, grid[0].length);
        int[] maxThree = new int[3];
        for (int length = 0; length < end; length++) {
            searchBigThree(grid, maxThree, length);
        }

        Arrays.sort(maxThree);
        int[] result = Arrays.stream(maxThree).distinct().sorted().toArray();

        // If there are less than three distinct values, return all of them.
        for (int i = 0; i < result.length / 2; i++) {
            int temp = result[i];
            result[i] = result[result.length - i - 1];
            result[result.length - i - 1] = temp;
        }
        return result;
    }

    void searchBigThree(int[][] grid, int[] maxThree, int length) {
        int end = grid.length - (length == 0 ? 0 : 2 * length);
        int end1 = grid[0].length - (length);
        for (int start = 0; start < end; start++) {
            for (int start1 = length; start1 < end1; start1++) {
                if (start + start1 >= length) {
                    addToMaxThree(maxThree, getSum(grid, start, start1, length));
                }
            }
        }
    }

        return sum;
