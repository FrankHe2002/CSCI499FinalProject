The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error. The for loop condition and the index variable direction are incorrect.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The for loop condition should be `(int i = 3; i <= n; i++)` because we want to iterate from 3 up to n.
2. The formula for calculating dp[i] is using `dp[i - 1]`, `dp[i - 3]` and multiplying `dp[i - 1]` by 2. The logic is correct for calculating the number of ways to tile the board, and we don't need to make any changes to the formula.

Now, let's apply the fix using minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTilings(int n) {
        long[] dp = new long[n + 3];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 2;
        dp[2] = 5;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = (2 * dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 3]) % 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) dp[n];
    }
}
```

After applying the fix, the code should work correctly to calculate the number of ways to tile a 2 x n board.
