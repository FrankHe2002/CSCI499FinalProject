The code currently doesn't compile because of a syntax error in the SkipListEntry class that does not have a closing parenthesis in the hasLeft() method.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
public boolean hasLeft() {
    return this.left != null;
}
```

After fixing the syntax error, the Java code should compile without any issues.
