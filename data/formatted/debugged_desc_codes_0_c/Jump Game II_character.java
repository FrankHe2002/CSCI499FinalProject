Bug type: Logical error

The code is implementing a greedy strategy to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index of the array. However, there is a logical error in the implementation. 

The issue is with the calculation of the localMaxRight. The line "localMaxRight = Math.max(i + nums[i], localMaxRight)" should be "localMaxRight = Math.max(i + nums[i], localMaxRight)".

To fix the bug:

We can iterate over the elements between L and R to find the maximum jump distance and update the localMaxRight accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 82.01% | Memory: 50 MB (Top 21.41%)
class Solution {

    public int jump(int[] nums) {

        int result = 0;

        int L = 0;
        int R = 0;

        while (R < nums.length - 1) {

            int localMaxRight = 0;

            for (int i = L; i <= R; i++) {
                localMaxRight = Math.max(i + nums[i], localMaxRight);
            }

            L = R + 1;
            R = localMaxRight;
            result++;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
