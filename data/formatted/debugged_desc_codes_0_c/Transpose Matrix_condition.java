The bug in the code is in the for loop conditions in the transpose method. The condition for the outer loop should be `i < n` instead of `i <= n` to prevent an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Also, the transposed matrix should have dimensions of n x m.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] transpose(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;

        int[][] trans = new int[n][m];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                trans[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
            }
        }

        return trans;
    }
}
```
