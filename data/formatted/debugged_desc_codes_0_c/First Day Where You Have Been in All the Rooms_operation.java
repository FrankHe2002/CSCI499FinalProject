The code provided is trying to find the label of the first day where all rooms have been visited. 

To debug the code, let's follow the described rules and understand the goal of the code.

- We need to iterate over the rooms, find the number of days spent in each room, and keep track of the total number of days.
- If the number of days is odd, we move to a room with a lower or equal room number specified by `nextVisit[i]`.
- If the number of days is even, we move to room `(i + 1) mod n`.

After analyzing the code, the issue seems to be in the else part of the for loop where we calculate `dp[i]`.

Let's apply the fix by updating the logic for calculating `dp[i]`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstDayBeenInAllRooms(int[] nextVisit) {
        int rooms = nextVisit.length;
        long dp[] = new long[rooms];
        int mod = (int) (1e9) + 7;
        for (int i = 1; i < rooms; i++) {
            dp[i] = (2 + 2 * dp[i - 1] - dp[nextVisit[i - 1]] + mod + dp[i - 1] - dp[nextVisit[i - 1]] + mod) % mod;
        }
        return (int) dp[rooms - 1];
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, the logic for calculating `dp[i]` in the else part of the for loop has been updated to match the rules described above. The previous error was in the calculation of `dp[i]`.

The updated logic ensures that the correct number of days spent in each room is maintained, and the function should now return the label of the first day where all rooms have been visited as expected.
