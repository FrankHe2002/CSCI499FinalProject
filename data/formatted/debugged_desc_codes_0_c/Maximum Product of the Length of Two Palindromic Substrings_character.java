The given code uses the Manacher's algorithm to find the lengths of palindromes at each index and then calculates the maximum product of the lengths of non-intersecting palindromic substrings.

The logic for calculating the lengths of the palindromes at each index using Manacher's algorithm seems correct. The issue appears to be in the logic for computing the maximum product of the lengths of non-intersecting palindromic substrings.

After analyzing the `maxProduct` method, it seems that the logic for updating the `left` and `right` arrays is not fully correct. The `max` variable is used to store the maximum length of a palindrome. The computation logic when updating `left` and `right` arrays needs to ensure that the new length of palindrome is updated correctly based on the length of the palindrome at the current index.

The main issue is that the initializations and updates of `max` in the logic for updating the `left` and `right` arrays are not reflecting the proper max length of palindromes to the left and right of each index.

Here's how the bug can be fixed:

```java
class Solution {

    public long maxProduct(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        int[] len = manachers(s);

        long[] left = new long[n];
        long[] right = new long[n];

        long maxLeft = 0;
        long maxRight = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            left[i] = (i + 1 - len[i]) / 2;
            maxLeft = Math.max(maxLeft, left[i]);
        }

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            right[i] = n - i - len[i] / 2;
            maxRight = Math.max(maxRight, right[i]);
        }

        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            res = Math.max(res, left[i] * maxRight);
        }

        return res;
    }

    private int[] manachers(String s) {
        int len = s.length();
        int[] P = new int[len];
        int c = 0;
        int r = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            int mirror = 2 * c - i;

            if (i < r) {
                P[i] = Math.min(r - i, P[mirror]);
            }

            int a = i + (1 + P[i]);
            int b = i - (1 + P[i]);
            while (a < len && b >= 0 && s.charAt(a) == s.charAt(b)) {
                P[i]++;
                a++;
                b--;
            }

            if (i + P[i] > r) {
                c = i;
                r = i + P[i];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) P[i] = 1 + 2 * P[i];
        return P;
    }
}
```

In this fix, the calculation of `left` and `right` arrays is updated and maximum lengths of palindromes to the left and right of each index are correctly calculated. Additionally, the computation of the maximum product of the lengths of non-intersecting palindromic substrings is based on the correct lengths of `left` and `right` arrays.
