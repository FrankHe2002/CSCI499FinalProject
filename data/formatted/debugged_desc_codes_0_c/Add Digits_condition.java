The given code calculates the digital root of a number, which is the recursive summation of its digits until the result is a single digit.

There is a bug in the code if num % 9 != 0, it should return num % 9; however, if num % 9 == 0, it should return 9 but the current code returns 0.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the second else if statement to check for num % 9 == 0. If the condition is true, we should return 9.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        else if (num % 9 == 0) return 9;
        else return num % 9;
    }
}
```
