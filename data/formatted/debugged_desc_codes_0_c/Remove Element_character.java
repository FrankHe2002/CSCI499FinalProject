The code contains a bug. The bug is a syntax error, as the for loop is not properly initialized.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the syntax error in the for loop initialization.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int ind = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[ind++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return ind;
    }
}
```
