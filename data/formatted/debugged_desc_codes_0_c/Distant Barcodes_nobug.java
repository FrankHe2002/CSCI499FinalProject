Bug: The code may have a bug related to the condition to fill the remaining characters. In the while loop, the position is being checked against the length of the barcodes array, and if it exceeds the length, it is reset to 1, which may result in incorrect placement of barcodes.

To identify and fix the bug, follow the step-by-step reasoning process:
1. The code initializes a map to count the frequency of each barcode and finds the maximum frequency.
2. It then tries to arrange the barcodes in a way that no two adjacent ones are equal.
3. The bug relates to the position tracking and may result in incorrect placements of barcodes.

To fix the bug, update the position tracking logic to ensure that the barcodes are placed correctly without exceeding the length of the array.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeBarcodes(int[] barcodes) {

        if (barcodes.length <= 2) {
            return barcodes; //Problem says solution always exists.
        }

        Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        Integer maxKey = null; // Character having max frequency

        for (int i : barcodes) {
            count.put(i, count.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
            if (maxKey == null || count.get(i) > count.get(maxKey)) {
                maxKey = i;
            }
        }

        int pos = 0;

        // Fill maxChar
        int curr = count.get(maxKey);
        while (curr-- > 0) {
            barcodes[pos] = maxKey;
            pos += 2;
            if (pos >= barcodes.length) {
                pos = 1; // Reset to 1 if exceeds length
            }
        }

        count.remove(maxKey); // Since that character is done, we don't need to fill it again

        // Fill the remaining Characters.
        for (int key : count.keySet()) {
            curr = count.get(key);

            while (curr-- > 0) {
                barcodes[pos] = key;
                pos += 2;
                if (pos >= barcodes.length) {
                    pos = 0; // Reset to 0 if exceeds length
                }
            }
        }

        return barcodes;
    }
}
```

The bug is fixed by resetting the position to 0 if it exceeds the length of the barcodes array in the while loop for filling the remaining characters. This ensures that the barcodes are placed correctly without exceeding the length and resolves the potential bug.
