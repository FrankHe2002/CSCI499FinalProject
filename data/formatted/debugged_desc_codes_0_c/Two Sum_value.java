There is a bug in the inner for loop where the value of j is set to i + 0, it should be i + 1. This will prevent checking the same element against itself.

Additionally, the return value should be null if no valid answer is found.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] answer = new int[2];
        // Two for loops for selecting two numbers and check sum equal to target or not

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                // j = i + 1; no need to check back elements it covers in i;
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    // Check sum == target or not
                    answer[0] = i;
                    answer[1] = j;
                    return answer;
                }
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
