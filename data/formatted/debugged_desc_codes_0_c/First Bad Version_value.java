The logic used in the given code is to implement a binary search to find the first bad version. The bug in the code lies in the calculation of the `mid` value inside the while loop.

The calculation of `mid` should be `int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;` to find the middle index within the range `s` to `e`. The current code is using `1` instead of `2` in the denominator, which is incorrect and will lead to incorrect results.

Below is the corrected code:

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = n;

        while (s < e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;

            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                e = mid;
            } else {
                s = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return e;
    }
}
```
