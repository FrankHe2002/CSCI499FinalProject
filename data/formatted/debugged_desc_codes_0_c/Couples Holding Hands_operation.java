Bug Type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is attempting to use a map to represent the pairs of people sitting together.
2. The code then tries to iterate through the row and count the number of swaps needed to make everyone sit next to their couple.
3. The loop that iterates through the row and checks the pairs has logical flaws due to incorrect handling of map operations.

Identified Bug:
1. The variable `count` is initialized to 0 but is never updated.
2. The check for the presence of a key in the map and the logic for counting swaps is incorrect.

Fix:
1. Initialize the `count` variable to 0 and increment it every time a swap is being made.
2. Correct the logic for checking and counting the swaps required to make everyone sit next to their couple.

Updated Code:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int minSwapsCouples(int[] row) { // Union -Find pairs for 2
        Map<Integer, Integer> parents = new HashMap<>();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < row.length; i += 2) {
            int parent = Math.min(row[i], row[i + 1]);
            int child = Math.max(row[i], row[i + 1]);
            parents.put(parent, child);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < row.length; i += 2) {
            if ((parents.containsKey(i) && parents.get(i) == (i + 1))
                    || (parents.containsKey(i + 1) && parents.get(i + 1) == i)) {
                continue;
            }
            count++;
            int partnerOfCurrent = parents.get(i);
            int expectedPartner = (i % 2 == 0) ? i + 1 : i - 1;
            parents.put(parents.get(i + 1), expectedPartner);
            parents.put(i + 1, partnerOfCurrent);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
