The code contains a bug where the final result is not checked for uniqueness. This will result in the possibility of duplicate even numbers in the result list. In the given example, if the input is 12, a valid split would be (2, 4, 6), but the current implementation does not account for uniqueness.

To fix this bug, the final result should be checked for uniqueness before returning it.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Long> maximumEvenSplit(long finalSum) {
        List<Long> res = new ArrayList<Long>();

        if (finalSum % 2 != 0) {
            return res;
        }

        long currNum = 2;
        long remainingSum = finalSum;

        while (currNum <= remainingSum) {
            res.add(currNum);
            remainingSum -= currNum;
            currNum += 2;
        }

        if (remainingSum > 0 && !res.contains(remainingSum)) {
            res.add(remainingSum);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
