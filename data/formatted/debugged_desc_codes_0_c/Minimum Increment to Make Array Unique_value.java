The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

First, let's analyze the code. The code consists of two approaches for the same problem, but they are included within the same method. This is not correct because it leads to unreachable code. The 'return answer;' statement within the first approach will make the second approach unreachable.

To fix this bug, the code should be separated into two distinct methods, each one implementing a different approach to solving the problem.

Additionally, it's important to choose one method and remove the other from the code to avoid confusion or unintentional use.

Here's the corrected code, separating the two approaches into different methods:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minIncrementForUnique(int[] nums) {
        return approach1(nums);
    }

    //Approach - 1 : Using a Count array
    public int approach1(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i : nums)
            max = Math.max(max, i);

        int count[] = new int[nums.length + max];

        for (int c : nums)
            count[c]++;

        int answer = 0, choosen = 0;
        int len = count.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (count[i] >= 0) {
                choosen += count[i] - 1;
                answer -= i * (count[i] - 1);
            } else if (choosen > 0 && count[i] == 0) {
                answer += i;
                choosen--;
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }

    //Approach - 2:
    public int approach2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int answer = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i - 1] >= nums[i]) {
                answer += nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
