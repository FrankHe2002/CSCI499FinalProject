The bug in the given code is a missing semicolon at `int X = x`.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. Review the code and look for any syntax errors.
2. Identify any missing or extra symbols in the code, such as missing semicolons or parentheses.

To fix the bug, simply add a semicolon at the end of the statement `int X = x`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java

class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int sum = 0;
        int X = x;

        while (x > 0) {
            sum = 10 * sum + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        return sum == X;
    }
}
```
