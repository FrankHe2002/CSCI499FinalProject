The bug in the provided code is that the square root is not being calculated correctly. The code is using a simple while loop to increment the "answer" variable until it reaches the square root of "x". However, the given approach does not match the mathematical definition of the square root.

To fix the bug, I will replace the while loop with a binary search algorithm to find the square root.

```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        long left = 1;
        long right = x;
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mid * mid == x) {
                return (int) mid;
            } else if (mid * mid < x) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return (int) left - 1;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, I have replaced the while loop with a binary search algorithm to find the square root. I'm using a "left" and "right" pointer to keep track of the search area, and I'm updating these pointers based on the comparison of the square of the "mid" value with the input "x". This approach ensures that the correct square root is found.
