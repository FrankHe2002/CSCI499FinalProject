The bug in the provided code is in the second for loop. The condition for the loop is incorrect and will cause it to never execute.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the bug identification and fixing process:

1. The code starts by splitting the input string `s` into an array of words using the `split` method and then reverses the order of the words.
2. The issue is with the second for loop that is intended to concatenate the reversed words into a single string.
3. Upon close inspection, the loop condition `for (int i = 0; i >= n - 1; i++)` is incorrect. The condition `i >= n - 1` will always be false because `i` starts at 0.
4. To fix the bug, the loop condition should be `i <= n - 1` to iterate over the array of words.

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] arr = s.replaceAll("\\s{2,}", " ").split(" ");
        // splitting based on while spaces by replaceing spaces by single gap 
        int n = arr.length;
        String temp = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[n - i - 1];
            arr[n - i - 1] = temp;
        }
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - 1; i++) {
            result += arr[i] + " ";
        }
        result += arr[n - 1];
        return result.trim();
    }
}
```
