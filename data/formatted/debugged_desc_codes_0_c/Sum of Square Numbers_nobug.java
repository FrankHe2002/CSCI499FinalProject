The code looks correct at first glance, but we need to consider the edge cases and potential bugs:

1. The constraints say that c can be a maximum of 231 - 1, which is a very large number. We need to make sure that the variables a and b are of long type to accommodate such large numbers.
2. The while loop condition checks if a is less than or equal to b, which is correct, but the condition for checking if a^2 + b^2 = c needs to be revised.

Let's fix the bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        long a = 0;
        long b = (long) Math.sqrt(c);

        while (a * a <= c) {
            long currentSum = (a * a) + (b * b);
            if (currentSum == c) {
                return true;
            } else if (currentSum < c) {
                a++;
            } else {
                b--;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
