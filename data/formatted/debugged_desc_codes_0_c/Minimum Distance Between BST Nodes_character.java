The code has a bug in the `find` method, specifically in the for loop. This loop is meant to find the minimum difference between the current node's value and all the values in the array. However, in each iteration of the loop, it is only comparing the current node's value with the value at index `i`. The intention was to compare the node's value with all previously encountered values in the array, so we need to iterate through the entire array instead of just comparing with a single value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the for loop to iterate through the entire array. We can use a separate variable to keep track of the previously encountered node value and calculate the difference with the current node value.

```java
class Solution {

    int mini = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    public void find(TreeNode root, ArrayList<Integer> arr) {

        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }

        find(root.left, arr);

        if (!arr.isEmpty()) {
            mini = Math.min(mini, Math.abs(root.val - arr.get(arr.size() - 1)));
        }

        arr.add(root.val);

        find(root.right, arr);
    }

    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
        find(root, arr);
        return mini;
    }
}
```
