Bug type:
The bug in the code is logic error which results in incorrect calculation of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes `count` to be the total number of cells minus the number of guards and walls.
2. It then populates the grid with 'W' for walls and 'G' for guards. 
3. Then for each guard, it attempts to mark all cells that the guard can see as 'P' and decrement the count if the cell is unoccupied. However, there might be a logic error which causes incorrect counting of unoccupied cells.

I will fix the bug by ensuring that the code correctly counts unoccupied cells.

Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countUnguarded(int m, int n, int[][] guards, int[][] walls) {
        int[][] dirs = {{1, 0}, {- 1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, - 1}};
        char[][] grid = new char[m][n];
        int count = m * n - guards.length - walls.length;
        for (int[] wall : walls) {
            int x = wall[0], y = wall[1];
            grid[x][y] = 'W';
        }
        for (int[] guard : guards) {
            int x = guard[0], y = guard[1];
            grid[x][y] = 'G';
            for (int[] dir : dirs) {
                int dx = dir[0], dy = dir[1];
                for (int i = 1; i < Math.max(m, n); i++) {
                    int newX = x + dx * i;
                    int newY = y + dy * i;
                    if (newX < 0 || newY < 0 || newX >= m || newY >= n || grid[newX][newY] == 'W' || grid[newX][newY] == 'P') {
                        break;
                    }
                    if (grid[newX][newY] != 'G') {
                        count--;
                    }
                    grid[newX][newY] = 'P';
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
