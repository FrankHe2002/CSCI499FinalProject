The code provided has a bug that is causing the intended output to not be produced. The bug is that the `continue` keyword is placed outside the if statement's curly braces. Due to this, the if statement does not have a body, and the `continue` statement will be executed regardless of the condition evaluation. This means that the code inside the if block will never be executed.

To fix this bug, I will place the `continue` statement inside the if statement's body. Additionally, we should also consider adding a check to skip the loop iteration if `cd` is 0.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        HashMap<Integer, Integer>[] dp = new HashMap[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        }

        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                long cd = (long) nums[i] - (long) nums[j];

                if (cd <= Integer.MIN_VALUE || cd >= Integer.MAX_VALUE || cd == 0) {
                    // skip the loop iteration if the condition is met
                    continue;
                }

                int endingAtj = dp[j].getOrDefault((int) cd, 0);
                int endingAti = dp[i].getOrDefault((int) cd, 0);

                ans += endingAtj;

                dp[i].put((int) cd, endingAtj + endingAti + 1);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

With these changes, the `continue` statement is now inside the if statement's body, and we added a check to skip the loop iteration if `cd` is 0. After the modification, the code should work as intended.
