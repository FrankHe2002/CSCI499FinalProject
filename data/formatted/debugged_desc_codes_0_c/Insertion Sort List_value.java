The identified bug in the provided code is an issue with the `prev` initialization in the `insertionSortList` method.

The `prev` node is initialized with `temp` and is not updated correctly within the while loop, which will prevent the sorting process from happening as intended.

The fix involves updating the initialization of the `cur.next` line to maintain the reference to the next node after swapping with `prev.next`.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode insertionSortList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode cur = head;
        ListNode temp = new ListNode(- -1);
        ListNode prev = temp;
        while (cur != null) {
            ListNode nxt = cur.next;
            if (prev.val >= cur.val)
                prev = temp;
            while (prev.next != null && prev.next.val < cur.val)
                prev = prev.next;
			
			cur.next = prev.next;
            prev.next = cur;
            cur = nxt;
        }
        return temp.next;
    }
}
```
