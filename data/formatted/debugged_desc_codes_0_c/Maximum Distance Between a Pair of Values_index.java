The bug in the provided code is in the while loop condition. The logic for determining the valid pairs and calculating the maximum distance is also incorrect.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The while loop condition is not correctly implemented. The goal is to find the largest j such that nums1[i] <= nums2[j]. However, the current implementation of the while loop does not directly address this goal.

2. The condition `if (nums1[i] > nums2[m + 1])` checks if the current element of nums1 is greater than the element in nums2. However, the correct condition should be `if (nums1[i] <= nums2[m])` to find the largest valid j.

3. The nested conditions for `nums1[i] == nums2[m]` and `nums1[i] < nums2[m]` are also incorrect and redundant.

4. The calculation of the maximum distance should be `max = Math.max(max, m - i)` instead of `max = Math.max(max, r - i)`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            int l = i;
            int r = nums2.length - 1;
            while (l <= r) {
                int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
                if (nums1[i] <= nums2[m]) {
                    max = Math.max(max, m - i);
                    l = m + 1;
                } else {
                    r = m - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

The changes made include:
1. Swapping the positions of l and r in the while loop condition.
2. Updating the comparison inside the while loop to `nums1[i] <= nums2[m]`.
3. Fixing the calculation of the maximum distance using `max = Math.max(max, m - i)`.
