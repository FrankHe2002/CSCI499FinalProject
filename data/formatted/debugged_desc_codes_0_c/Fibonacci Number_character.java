Bug type: Syntax error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is attempting to calculate the Fibonacci sequence using a dynamic programming approach, storing the results in an array.
2. The bug seems to be a syntax error in the for loop where the array is being populated with the Fibonacci numbers.

Fix:
- Change `fiboArrayi` to `fiboArray[i]` in the for loop.
- Start the loop from `i = 2` instead of `i = 1` to correctly fill the array with Fibonacci numbers.

```java
class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {

        int[] fiboArray = new int[n + 2];

        fiboArray[0] = 0;
        fiboArray[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            fiboArray[i] = fiboArray[i - 1] + fiboArray[i - 2];
        }

        return fiboArray[n];
    }
}
```
