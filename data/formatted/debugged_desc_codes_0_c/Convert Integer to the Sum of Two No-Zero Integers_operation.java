The bug in the code is the way the condition for checking if A and B are No-Zero integers is written. The code is using the `contains` method on a string formed from the integer A, which will not work as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to convert the integers A and B to strings first, and then check for the presence of '0'.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
        int B;
        for (int A = 1; A < n; ++A) {
            B = n - A;
            if (!(String.valueOf(A).contains("0")) && !(String.valueOf(B).contains("0")))
                return new int[]{A, B};
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```
