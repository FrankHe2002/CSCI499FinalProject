The goal here is to find any bugs that might exist in the code.

There are a few aspects to consider:
1. Check if the given code compiles - it does.
2. Evaluate the logic of the code - it seems to be finding simplified fractions between 0 and 1.
3. Check whether the code runs within the constraints. 

One thing to consider about the constraints is that the code needs to "return a list of all simplified fractions." Let's check if the code is running within the constraints.

Here's an explanation of the current process:
- Create a list to store the simplified fractions.
- Nested loop to iterate through numerator and denominator.
- For each pair, check if they are relatively prime (i.e., the greatest common divisor is 1).
- If they are, add the fraction to the list.

After analyzing the code, I found a potential issue. The outer loop goes from 1 to n (exclusive), and the inner loop goes from the current numerator to n (inclusive). This implies that when the numerator is n-1, the denominator could be equal to n, which is not a proper simplification.

To fix this issue, I should modify the outer loop to go up to n-1 instead of n. 

Here's the modified code in markdown:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> simplifiedFractions(int n) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int numerator = 1; numerator < n; numerator++) {
            for (int denominator = numerator + 1; denominator <= n; denominator++) {
                if (gcd(numerator, denominator) == 1) {
                    list.add(numerator + "/" + denominator);
                }
            }
        }
        return list;
    }

    static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (a == 0) {
            return b;
        }
        return gcd(b % a, a);
    }
}
```
After making this change, the code should work correctly and fulfill the constraints.
