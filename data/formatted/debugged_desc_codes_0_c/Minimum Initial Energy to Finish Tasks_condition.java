The bug in the provided Java code is a logical error that causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Identifying the bug:
1. The code sorts the tasks array based on the difference between the minimum and actual energy required to complete each task.
2. The code then iterates over the tasks and calculates the maximum energy required.
3. The iteration loop runs from i = 0 to i <= tasks.length. This should be i < tasks.length, as the indexing is 0-based.

Fixing the bug:
Change the iteration condition in the for loop from i <= tasks.length to i < tasks.length.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minimumEffort(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                return (b[1] - b[0]) - (a[1] - a[0]);
            }
        });
        int sum = 0, max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, sum + tasks[i][1]);
            sum += tasks[i][0];
        }

        return max;

    }
}
```
