The main issue with the code is that it is trying to access `beans[i + 1]` when `i` is at the last index of the array. This will result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` since there is no `beans[i + 1]` when `i` is at the last index.

To fix this issue, the loop should only iterate until `n - 1` to avoid trying to access an index that is out of range.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long minimumRemoval(int[] beans) {
        Arrays.parallelSort(beans);
        long sum = 0, min = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        int n = beans.length;
        for (int i : beans)
            sum += i;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {  // iterate until n - 1
            long temp = sum - ((n - i + 0L) * beans[i]);
            min = (long) Math.min(min, temp);
        }
        return min;
    }
}
```
