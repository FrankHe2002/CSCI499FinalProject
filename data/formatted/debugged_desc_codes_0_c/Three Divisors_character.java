The bug in the given code is in the for loop logic used to check for the number of divisors. The loop logic is flawed and will not give the correct result. 

Here's the step-by-step process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. Start by analyzing the constraints and requirements.
2. The function should return true if there are exactly three divisors for n.
3. The code first checks if n < 4 and returns false, which is correct as numbers less than 4 don't have 3 divisors.
4. The code then calculates the square root of n.
5. The for loop iterates from 2 to the square root of n and checks if it has a divisor.
6. The bug is in the condition of the for loop. Instead of using `i * i < n`, it should be `i * i <= n` to correctly check the divisors.
7. Inside the loop, the code should increment the count of divisors if `n % i == 0`, but the loop condition and logic inside the loop are flawed.
8. Lastly, there is a missing semicolon in the return statement.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isThree(int n) {
        if (n < 4) return false;
        int count = 0;
        int res = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                if (i * i != n) { // ensure that count doesn't get incremented twice for perfect squares
                    count += 2;
                } else {
                    count += 1;
                }
            }
            if (count > 3) return false;
        }
        return count == 3;
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, I have added a count variable to keep track of the number of divisors. I modified the for loop condition to `i * i <= n` to account for the missing check for perfect squares to avoid double counting the square root. I also adjusted the increment of the count variable based on whether the divisor is perfect or not, and updated the return statement accordingly.

This fixes the logic for counting the divisors and checks if the count is exactly 3 before returning the result.
