Bug Type: Syntax Error

The code provided has a syntax error in the `minCost` method. This is because the code has duplicated variable names inside the method and also has a variable used before it's declared. The code will not compile.

Here are the steps to identify and fix the bug:
1. Inside the `minCost` method, there are two variables named `t2` which is a syntax error. We need to rename one of them to a different name.
2. The variable `t1` is used before it's declared, so we need to fix that as well.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(String colors, int[] neededTime) {
        return minCost(colors, neededTime, 0, neededTime.length - 1);
    }

    public int minCost(String colors, int[] neededTime, int start, int end) {
        if (start == end) {
            return 0;
        }

        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        int lEnd = mid;
        int rStart = mid + 1;
        int t1 = minCost(colors, neededTime, start, lEnd);
        int t2 = minCost(colors, neededTime, rStart, end);

        while (neededTime[lEnd] < 0 && lEnd >= start) {
            -- lEnd;
        }
        while (neededTime[rStart] < 0 && rStart <= end) {
            ++ rStart;
        }

        if (colors.charAt(lEnd) != colors.charAt(rStart)) {
            return t1 + t2;
        }

        int removeTime = 0;
        if (neededTime[lEnd] <= neededTime[rStart]) {
            removeTime = neededTime[lEnd];
            neededTime[lEnd] *= - 1;
        } else {
            removeTime = neededTime[rStart];
            neededTime[rStart] *= - 1;
        }

        return t1 + t2 + removeTime;
    }
}
```
