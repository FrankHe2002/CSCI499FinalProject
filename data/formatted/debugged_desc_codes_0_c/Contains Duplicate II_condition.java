Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code iterates through the input array `nums` and checks if the current element has been seen before within a distance of `k` from the current index.
2. If the condition of the `if` statement is met, the code returns true, indicating that two distinct indices with the same value are within the specified distance.
3. If the end of the iteration is reached without meeting the condition, the code returns false, indicating that no such indices were found.

Identifying the Bug:
The bug in the code is that the condition inside the `if` statement is incorrect. It should return true if the absolute difference between the indices is less than or equal to `k`, not greater than `k`.

Fixing the Bug:
Modify the condition inside the `if` statement to check if the absolute difference between the indices is less than or equal to `k`.

The fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(nums[i]) && (Math.abs(map.get(nums[i]) - i) <= k)) {
                return true;
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
