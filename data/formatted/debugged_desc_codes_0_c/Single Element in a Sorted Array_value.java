The code seems to have a logic bug. The algorithm logic should be adjusted as follows:

To find the single element in an array with only integers where every element appears exactly twice, we can use a binary search approach to find the single element. We can compare the middle element with its neighbors to determine which half of the array to continue searching in.

To identify and fix the bug in the original code:

1. In the while loop, we first need to check if the mid element is the single element. If the mid element is the single element, we can return it.
2. If the mid element is not the single element, we need to consider the two subarrays formed after the mid index and reduce the search space by updating the low and high pointers accordingly.

Here's the revised code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int h = nums.length - 1;

        while (l < h) {
            int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;

            if (mid % 2 == 1) {
                mid--;  // Adjust the mid to point to an even index to compare with its neighboring elements
            }

            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) {
                l = mid + 2;   // Single element is in the right half
            } else {
                h = mid;       // Single element is in the left half
            }
        }

        return nums[l];
    }
}
```

In the revised code, we first check if the mid index is odd or even. If it's odd, we decrement it so that it points to an even index. Then we compare the mid element with its neighbor and update the low and high pointers accordingly. We continue the search until the low and high pointers meet, and return the value at the low index, as it will be the single element. The revised logic ensures that the solution runs in O(log n) time and O(1) space.
