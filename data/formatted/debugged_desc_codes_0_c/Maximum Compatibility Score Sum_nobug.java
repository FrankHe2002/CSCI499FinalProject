Bug type: Logic Error

The `max` variable is declared as an instance variable for the `Solution` class. This will cause the value of `max` to persist across different test cases, which is not desirable. The `max` variable should be declared as a local variable in the `maxCompatibilitySum` method.

In the `helper` method, the base case is implemented correctly, and the recursion logic looks fine. The bug lies in the `score` method where the length of the second array (mentors) should be checked instead of the first array (students).

The bugs will be fixed, and the code will be formatted in markdown format:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxCompatibilitySum(int[][] students, int[][] mentors) {
        int max = 0;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[mentors.length];
        max = helper(visited, students, mentors, 0);
        return max;
    }

    public int helper(boolean[] visited, int[][] students, int[][] mentors, int pos) {
        if (pos >= students.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        int maxScore = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < mentors.length; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                visited[i] = true;
                maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, score(students[pos], mentors[i]) + helper(visited, students, mentors, pos + 1));
                visited[i] = false;
            }
        }
        return maxScore;
    }

    public int score(int[] a, int[] b) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {
            if (a[i] == b[i]) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
In the fixed code, `max` is declared as a local variable in the `maxCompatibilitySum` method. Additionally, the `score` method is corrected to iterate over the length of the mentor's answers.
