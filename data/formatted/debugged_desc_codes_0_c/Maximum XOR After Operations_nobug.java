The given code is attempting to find the maximum possible bitwise XOR of all elements of the nums array after applying the given operation any number of times. However, the code provided is simply performing a bitwise OR operation instead of the required operation.

To fix the bug, the code should perform the required operation of ANDing and XORing the elements of the array as described in the problem statement.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumXOR(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            res = Math.max(res, res ^ nums[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
