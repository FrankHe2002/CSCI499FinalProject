There is a bug in the given code. The bug type is a logical error in the calculation of the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of the string.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The `dp` array is being used to store the counts of distinct subsequences so far, but there seems to be an error in the logic for updating the counts and handling the cases of character occurrence.

2. The bug can be identified in the following lines:
   ```java
   if (li[idx] != null) dp[i - 1] = (curr - dp[li[idx] - 1] + mod) % mod;
   else dp[i] = curr;
   ```
   The subtraction logic is incorrect. It should subtract the count of sequences before the last occurrence of the current character. The `dp[i - 1]` should be updated with the correct count.

3. To fix the bug, we should update the line as follows:
   ```java
   if (li[idx] != null) dp[i] = (curr - dp[li[idx] - 1] + mod) % mod;
   else dp[i] = curr;
   ```

4. After fixing the bug, the updated code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 9 ms (Top 61.84%) | Memory: 42.7 MB (Top 63.49%)
class Solution {
    public int distinctSubseqII(String s) {
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        //For storing the last occurred index of a character.
        Integer li[] = new Integer[26];
        int n = s.length();
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        //one empty string possible for a string of length 0.
        dp[0] = 1;
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            //If the character is first occurred then 2 cases
            //Case 1 : we will not concat the character with previous subsequences
            //Case 2 : we will concat it.
            //Therefore, we multiply 2 with previous count.
            int curr = (2 * (dp[i - 1] % mod)) % mod;
            //Getting the int index from char for checking the previous occurrence in li[]
            int idx = c[i - 1] - 'a';
            //If previously occurred then we have to subtract the subsequences which are made
            //till li[idx-1] because they would be duplicated and counted twice unnecessarily
            if (li[idx] != null) dp[i] = (curr - dp[li[idx] - 1] + mod) % mod;
            else dp[i] = curr;
            li[idx] = i;
        }
        //Doing -1 because we don't have to count the empty string.
        return dp[n] - 1;
    }
}
```
