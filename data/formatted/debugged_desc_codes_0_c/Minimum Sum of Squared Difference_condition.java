The code appears to be correct logically, but there are some issues with the for loop conditions:

1. In the first for loop, the condition should be `i >= maxDiff` to iterate while `i` is greater than or equal to zero. The current condition `i > 0` causes an infinite loop as the loop never executes.

2. In the second for loop, the condition should be `i <= maxDiff` to iterate while `i` is less than or equal to `maxDiff`. The current condition `i > maxDiff` never evaluates to true, so the loop will not run.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
for (int i = maxDiff; i >= 0 && kSum > 0; i--) {
    // ...
}

for (int i = 0; i <= maxDiff; i++) {
    // ...
}
```

With these changes, the code should work as intended.
