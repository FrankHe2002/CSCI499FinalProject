The logic within the `effectiveLocations` method attempts to find the effective locations to insert a ball by color. However, there is an issue within the current implementation that interferes with correct functionality. When a ball is not located next to a ball of the same color, it should be between two identical balls of a different color.

To fix the bug in this method, the following changes should be incorporated:

```java
// Rewrite the effectiveLocations method to handle the case of a ball located next to a ball of the same color and between two identical balls of a different color
private List<Integer> effectiveLocations(String color, String board, boolean isLastInHand) {
    List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

    // calculate the effective locations
    for (int i = 0; i <= board.length(); i++) {
        if (i < board.length() - 1 && board.substring(i, i + 2).equals(color + color)) {
            res.add(i);
            i += 2; // skip the next 2 locations
        } else if (i < board.length() && board.substring(i, i + 1).equals(color)) {
            // skip the next 1 location; it would be part of the same consecutive set of "this" color
            i++;
        } else {
            if (i > 0 && board.length() > i && board.substring(i - 1, i).equals(board.substring(i, i + 1))) {
                res.add(i);
            }
        }
    }
    // ensure that the last ball in hand must be added to 2 others of the same color
    if (isLastInHand) {
        return res;
    }

    return res;
}
```

By implementing this change, the `effectiveLocations` method should now work as intended and calculate the effective locations to insert the colored balls accurately.
