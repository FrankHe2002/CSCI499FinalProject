The bug in the provided code is in the while loop condition. The intention of the while loop is to keep right shifting both left and right until they are not equal, and to count the number of right shifts performed. However, the condition `while (left == right)` should be `while (left != right)`.

Additionally, the return statement has a logical error. It should return `right << count` instead of `right <<= count`.

Below is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left != right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            count++;
        }
        return right << count;
    }
}
```
