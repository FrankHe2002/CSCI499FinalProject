The code seems to be following the requirements, but without running the code, it's hard to tell if there are any bugs. However, one potential bug that can be identified through review is when finding the rightmost bit that is set to 1. The code uses a while loop to find the rightmost bit, but it will run indefinitely if the rightmost bit is never found, causing an infinite loop.

To fix this, we need to change the condition in the while loop to ensure that it will stop when the rightmost bit is found.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int xor = 0;
        for (int num : nums) xor ^= num;

        // Find which rightmost bit is set to 1
        int rightmostBit = 1;
        while ((rightmostBit & xor) == 0) rightmostBit = rightmostBit << 1;

        // Split nums array into 2 group based rightmost bit set
        int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if ((num & rightmostBit) != 0) num1 ^= num;
            else num2 ^= num;
        }
        return new int[] {num1, num2};
    }
}
```

This modification ensures that the while loop stops when the rightmost bit is found.
