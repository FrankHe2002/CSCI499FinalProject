The given Java code is an implementation of the Solution class, where it initializes the object with the head of the singly-linked list and provides a method to choose a node randomly from the list and returns its value. The bug in the code is related to obtaining a random node's value from the linked list.

### Bug Type:
The bug in the code is related to the random number generation logic. The code uses the `Math.random()` method which generates a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. This results in incorrect probability calculations for selecting the nodes from the linked list.

### Fix and Explanation:
To fix the bug, we need to implement a proper random number generation mechanism that provides an equal probability for all nodes to be selected. We can achieve this by using the `Random` class in Java to generate random numbers.

Also, the method for selecting the nodes and updating the answer (result) should be modified for the correct implementation of reservoir sampling.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.Random;

class Solution {
    ListNode head;
    Random random;

    public Solution(ListNode head) {
        this.head = head;
        random = new Random();
    }

    public int getRandom() {
        ListNode p = this.head;
        int selectedValue = p.val;
        int index = 1;
        
        p = p.next;
        while (p != null) {
            index++;
            int r = random.nextInt(index) + 1;  
            if (r == 1) {   // r is in the range 1 to index
                selectedValue = p.val;
            }
            p = p.next;
        }
        
        return selectedValue;
    }
}
```
In this fixed code, the `Random` class is used for generating random numbers. The method of selecting the nodes and updating the result is implemented based on reservoir sampling, where each node has an equal probability of being selected.
