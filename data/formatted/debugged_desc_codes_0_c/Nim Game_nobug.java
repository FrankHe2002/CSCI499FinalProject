The given Java code represents a Nim game, where the objective is to determine if the current player can win the game, assuming both players play optimally. 

Upon reviewing the code, the logic seems to be incorrect. The current implementation only checks if the number of stones in the heap is a multiple of 4. If the number of stones is a multiple of 4, it returns false because in that case, the player will lose. However, this is not accurate because the player can still win if the number of stones is not a multiple of 4.

To fix this issue, we need to update the conditional logic to account for the optimal strategy to win the Nim game.

Here's the fixed Java code with the updated logic:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- We removed the if-else statement and directly returned the result of the expression `n % 4 != 0`. This expression returns true if the number of stones is not a multiple of 4, indicating that the current player can win the game.

The logic has been updated to correctly determine if the current player can win the Nim game.
