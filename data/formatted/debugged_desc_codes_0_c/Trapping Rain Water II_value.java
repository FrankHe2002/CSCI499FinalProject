Bug type:
The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
1. The given code aims to calculate the volume of water it can trap after raining based on the elevation map provided.
2. The code utilizes a PriorityQueue to store the boundary elements, and then iterates through it to calculate the trapped water based on the height difference.
3. While the code implementation looks correct, there can be an issue with the condition to check if the current cell being processed is the boundary cell.

Identifying and Fixing the Bug:
1. The bug seems to be in the condition where the boundary elements are added to the priority queue.
2. Upon review, the condition `if (rowdash >= 1 && coldash >= 0 && rowdash < n && coldash < m && visited[rowdash][coldash] == false)` is incorrect and it should be `if (rowdash >= 0 && coldash >= 0 && rowdash < n && coldash < m && !visited[rowdash][coldash])`.

Updated code:
```java
// ... (existing code remains the same)

while (pq.size() > 0) {
    pair rem = pq.remove();
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        int rowdash = rem.row + dir[i][0];
        int coldash = rem.col + dir[i][1];

        if (rowdash >= 0 && coldash >= 0 && rowdash < n && coldash < m && !visited[rowdash][coldash]) { // fix the condition
            visited[rowdash][coldash] = true;
            if (heightMap[rowdash][coldash] >= rem.val) {
                pq.add(new pair(rowdash, coldash, heightMap[rowdash][coldash])); // boundary is updated
            } else {
                int waterstored = rem.val - heightMap[rowdash][coldash];
                ans += waterstored; // now this will act as a wall add in pq
                pq.add(new pair(rowdash, coldash, heightMap[rowdash][coldash] + waterstored));
            }
        }
    }
}

// ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

The fix addresses the logical error in the condition, ensuring that the correct boundary elements are added to the priority queue for processing.
