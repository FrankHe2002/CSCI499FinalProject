Bug:
The issue with the current code is that it doesn't correctly determine the side length of the largest square that can be obtained from the rectangles. The logic for comparing lengths of rectangles and updating the maximum side length is incorrect.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to compare whether the length or width of each rectangle is less than or equal to the current maximum side length. Then, we can update the count based on the maximum side length.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countGoodRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
        int max = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rectangles.length; i++) {
            int minSide = Math.min(rectangles[i][0], rectangles[i][1]);
            if (minSide >= max) {
                max = minSide;
                count = 1;
            } else if (minSide == max) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
