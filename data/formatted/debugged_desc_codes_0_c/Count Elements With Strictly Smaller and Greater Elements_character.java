The code provided is trying to determine the number of elements in the array `nums` that have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element. 

Potential Bug:
- The code does not handle the case when there are duplicate elements in the array `nums`.
- Also, the code does not exclude elements that are the same as both `nmin` and `nmax`, which may falsely increase the count.

The fix involves using a `Set` to keep track of unique elements in the array and using a conditional statement to exclude elements that are the same as `nmin` and `nmax`.

Here's the revised code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int countElements(int[] nums) {
        int nmin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int nmax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int a : nums) {
            nmin = Math.min(a, nmin);
            nmax = Math.max(a, nmax);
            set.add(a);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int a : set) {
            if (a > nmin && a < nmax)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
