The code is intended to calculate the minimum and maximum number of moves given the positions of three stones on the X-axis. However, upon reviewing the code, it seems that there is a bug in the logic for finding the minimum and maximum number of moves.

### Bug Type
Logical Error

### Reasoning Process
1. The `numMovesStones` method is supposed to call the `findMaximum` and `findMinimum` methods to calculate the minimum and maximum moves, but the logic inside these methods seems flawed.
2. The `findMaximum` method recursively tries to find the maximum number of moves, but the recursive logic and conditions seem incorrect.
3. The `findMinimum` method also seems to have incorrect logic for finding the minimum number of moves.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the logic inside the `findMaximum` and `findMinimum` methods should be corrected.

### Updated Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] numMovesStones(int a, int b, int c) {
        int[] arr = {a, b, c};
        Arrays.sort(arr);

        int maximum = Math.max(arr[1] - arr[0], 1) + Math.max(arr[2] - arr[1], 1) - 2;
        int minimum = (arr[1] - arr[0] <= 2 || arr[2] - arr[1] <= 2) ? 1 : 2;

        return new int[] {minimum, maximum};
    }
}
```

### Changes Made
1. Removed the `findMaximum` and `findMinimum` methods and moved the logic directly into the `numMovesStones` method.
2. Used the `Arrays.sort` to sort the array of stones in ascending order.
3. Calculated the minimum and maximum number of moves directly based on the sorted positions of the stones.
4. Updated the return statement to return the minimum and maximum moves directly.
