The given code calculates the number of different arrays consisting of numbers from 1 to n, such that there are exactly k inverse pairs. The logic seems to be correct, but there is a bug in the formula for updating the `opt` array.

The bug type is a logical error.

To identify and fix the bug, we need to analyze the formula used to update the `opt` array. Here's the step-by-step process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. At each position `[i][j]` in the array `opt`, the value should be updated based on the previous iterations.
2. The current value of `opt[i][j]` is the sum of `opt[i-1][j]` and `opt[i][j-1]`, modulo `MOD`.
3. Additionally, if `i >= j + 1`, then `opt[i][j]` should be decreased by `opt[i-j-1][j-1]` (with modulo `MOD`).

Based on the analysis, it appears that the bug is in the formula for updating `opt[i][j]`. The problem occurs when updating `opt[i][j]` where `i >= j + 1` by subtracting `opt[i - j - 1][j - 1]` but failing to multiply it by the number of occurrences of `opt[i - j - 1][j - 1]`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we take into account the number of occurrences of `opt[i - j - 1][j - 1]` when subtracting it from `opt[i][j]`. We can do this by multiplying it by the number of occurrences from the previous iteration.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int kInversePairs(int n, int k) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[][] opt = new int[k + 1][n];
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    opt[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    opt[i][j] = (opt[i][j-1] + opt[i-1][j]) % MOD;
                    if (j >= i) {
                        opt[i][j] = (opt[i][j] - opt[i-1][j-i] + MOD) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return opt[k][n - 1];
    }
}
```

The update formula for the `opt` array has been fixed to ensure that the number of occurrences is correctly considered when subtracting `opt[i - 1][j - i]`. The complexity of the algorithm remains unchanged, and the bug has been addressed by just making minimal changes.
