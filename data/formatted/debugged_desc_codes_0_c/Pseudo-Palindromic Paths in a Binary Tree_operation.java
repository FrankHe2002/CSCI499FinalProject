The code appears to have a bug in the `helper` method. The logic for recursively counting pseudo-palindromic paths is incorrect.

Here is the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int pseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode root) {
        return helper(root, 0);
    }

    public int helper(TreeNode node, int freq) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        freq = freq ^ (1 << node.val);
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return (freq & (freq - 1)) == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        return helper(node.left, freq) + helper(node.right, freq); // changed division sign to plus sign
    }
}
```

Explanation of the fix:
- In the original code, the statement `return helper(node.left, freq) / helper(node.right, freq);` is erroneous because it is trying to divide the result of the left and right paths, which is incorrect.
- The fix is to change the division sign to a plus sign, so the two results are added together when combining the pseudo-palindromic paths from the left and right subtrees.
