Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The given code calculates the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of the array equal but there is a bug in the code. The bug is in the if statement condition where it adds n % 2 instead of subtracting it. Additionally, the calculation for ans is not correct.

Step-by-step fix:
1. Update the if condition to subtract n % 2 instead of adding.
2. Update the calculation for ans to properly calculate the minimum number of operations needed.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int n) {
        int ans = (n / 2) * (n / 2);
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            ans += n / 2;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
