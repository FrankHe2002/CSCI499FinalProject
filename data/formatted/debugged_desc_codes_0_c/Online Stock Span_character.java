Bug Type:
1. Syntax Error: There is a missing semicolon in the line `stack = new Stack<>()`.
2. Logical Error: The logic to calculate the span of the stock's price is incorrect.

Identifying and Fixing the Bug:
1. Missing semicolon:
   - The error is straightforward to fix. We simply need to add a semicolon at the end of the line `stack = new Stack<>()`.

2. Logical Error:
   - The logical error is in the `next` method where the span is incorrectly calculated. We should be accumulating the spans of consecutive days where the stock price is less than or equal to today's price, but the current logic has the potential to give incorrect spans.
   - The correct logic should be: pop elements from the stack as long as the stock price is less than or equal to today's price and accumulate their spans. Then push the current stock price along with its span onto the stack.
   - We also need to return the accumulated span after each iteration.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Pair {
    int stock;
    int span;

    public Pair(int stock, int span) {
        this.stock = stock;
        this.span = span;
    }
}

class StockSpanner {
    Stack<Pair> stack;

    public StockSpanner() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
    }

    public int next(int price) {
        int span = 1;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek().stock <= price) {
            span += stack.pop().span;
        }
        stack.push(new Pair(price, span));
        return span;
    }
}
```

The bug in the provided code has been identified as a syntax error (missing semicolon) and a logical error in the calculation of the stock span. Both have been fixed without reorganizing or optimizing the code.
