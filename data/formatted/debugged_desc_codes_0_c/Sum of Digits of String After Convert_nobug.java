The logic of the code itself seems fine, but there is a bug in the part where it calculates the sum of the digits of the resulting integer. The bug occurs due to the fact that the sum is being calculated using the value of the resulting integer string, and not the value of the newly calculated sum.

To fix this, we need to store the newly calculated sum in a temporary variable and then update the "result" string with this sum after each iteration.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getLucky(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
            sb.append((s.charAt(i) - 'a') + 1);
        String result = sb.toString();

        if (result.length() == 1)
            return Character.getNumericValue(result.charAt(0));

        int sum = 0;
        while (k-- > 0 && result.length() > 1) {
            int tempSum = 0; // New variable to store the temporary sum
            for (int i = 0; i < result.length(); i++)
                tempSum += Character.getNumericValue(result.charAt(i)); // Calculate the new sum

            result = String.valueOf(tempSum); // Update the result with the new sum
        }

        return Integer.parseInt(result); // Convert the result back to integer and return
    }
}
```

In this modified code, the temporary variable "tempSum" is used to store the newly calculated sum, and then the "result" variable is updated with this new sum after each iteration. Finally, the result is converted back to an integer using `Integer.parseInt()` before returning the value.
