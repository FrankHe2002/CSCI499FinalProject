The bug in the provided code is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This occurs in the for loop where `i` is not properly incremented and `sentences[i + 2]` could go out of bounds of the array.

To fix this bug, we can iterate through the array `sentences` and split each sentence into words, then compare the length of the split array with the current max length.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 6 ms (Top 54.44%) | Memory: 45.2 MB (Top 33.72%)
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
            String[] words = sentences[i].split(" ");
            max = Math.max(max, words.length);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
