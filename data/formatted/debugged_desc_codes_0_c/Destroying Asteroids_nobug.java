The given Java code looks promising for solving the problem. The approach of using two PriorityQueues to minimize the collision of asteroids with the planet is a valid strategy. One priority queue is used to store the negative values of the asteroid masses and the other to store the positive values. Then, by simulating the collisions, we can check if all the asteroids are destroyed or not.

However, there is a limitation in the code. The bigMass is declared as a long, but it should have the datatype of an integer. As the problem description states, the mass lies between 1 and 10^5, which satisfies the integer datatype constraint.

Here's the modified code with the bug fixed:

```java
// Runtime: 476 ms (Top 5.23%) | Memory: 135.2 MB (Top 5.23%)
class Solution {
    public boolean asteroidsDestroyed(int mass, int[] asteroids) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();

        for (int val : asteroids)
            maxHeap.add(val);

        int bigMass = mass; // Change long to int

        while (maxHeap.size() > 0) {
            int curr = maxHeap.poll();

            if (bigMass >= curr) {
                bigMass += curr;
                while (minHeap.size() > 0 && bigMass >= minHeap.peek()) {
                    bigMass += minHeap.poll();
                }
            } else {
                minHeap.add(curr);
            }
        }

        return minHeap.size() == 0 && maxHeap.size() == 0;
    }
}
```

The bug was that the datatype for bigMass was declared as long, but it should have been an int as per the constraint of the problem. By changing the type to int, the bug is now fixed.
