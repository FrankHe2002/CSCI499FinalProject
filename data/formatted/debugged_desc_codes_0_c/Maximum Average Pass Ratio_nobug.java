There is a bug in the provided code. The issue is with the Comparator used to compare the double arrays in the PriorityQueue. When calculating the difference (adiff and bdiff), the division results are getting truncated to integers, thereby resulting in incorrect comparisons.

To fix this bug, the division should be performed using double data type to retain the precision. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public double maxAverageRatio(int[][] classes, int extraStudents) {
        PriorityQueue<double[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<double[]>() {
            public int compare(double[] a, double[] b) {
                double adiff = (a[0] + 1) / (a[1] + 1) - (a[0] / (double)a[1]);
                double bdiff = (b[0] + 1) / (b[1] + 1) - (b[0] / (double)b[1]);
                if (adiff == bdiff) return 0;
                return adiff > bdiff ? -1 : 1;
            }
        });

        for (int[] c : classes) pq.add(new double[] {c[0], c[1]});

        for (int i = 0; i < extraStudents; i++) {
            double[] curr = pq.poll();
            pq.add(new double[] {curr[0] + 1, curr[1] + 1});
        }

        double sum = 0;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            double[] curr = pq.poll();
            sum += curr[0] / curr[1];
        }

        return sum / classes.length;
    }
}
```
The bug was identified by analyzing the compare method in the Comparator for the double array. By fixing the division to use double data types for the appropriate values, the bug will be resolved.
