The bug in the provided code is that it does not consider the frequency of characters in the strings for the second type of operation. The code is not correctly implementing the second type of operation: "Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character."

To fix this, we need to ensure that the frequency of characters is also the same between the two strings. This can be done by comparing the sorted frequency arrays of the characters.

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
// Runtime: 24 ms (Top 51.63%) | Memory: 58.9 MB (Top 49.30%)
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    private int N = 26;

    public boolean closeStrings(String word1, String word2) {
        // count the English letters
        int[] arr1 = new int[N], arr2 = new int[N];
        for (char ch : word1.toCharArray())
            arr1[ch - 'a']++;
        for (char ch : word2.toCharArray())
            arr2[ch - 'a']++;

        // check if the frequencies of characters are the same
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if ((arr1[i] == 0 && arr2[i] != 0) || (arr1[i] != 0 && arr2[i] == 0)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        Arrays.sort(arr1);
        Arrays.sort(arr2);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (arr1[i] != arr2[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, after counting the frequencies of characters, we compare the arrays `arr1` and `arr2` to ensure that they contain the same characters with the same frequencies before sorting them. This ensures that the second type of operation is correctly represented.
