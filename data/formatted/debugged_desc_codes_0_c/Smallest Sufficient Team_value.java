There is a bug in the code that causes the smallest sufficient team to be miscalculated.

To identify the bug, we need to understand the logic and process used in the code to find the sufficient team.

First, for every state (set of skills), the code iterates through all people and checks if adding their skills to the state improves the solution. If it does, it updates the dp array and the corresponding parent and who arrays for that state.

The bug comes in the comparison of if `dp[cur] > dp[i] + 2`. Since the update to `dp[cur]` is meant to be `dp[i] + 1`, the comparison should be `dp[cur] > dp[i] + 1`.

Let's fix the bug by updating the comparison.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] smallestSufficientTeam(String[] req_skills, List<List<String>> people) {
        int N = 1 << req_skills.length, INF = (int) 1e9;
        int[] parent = new int[N];
        int[] who = new int[N];
        int[] dp = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(dp, INF);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (dp[i] != INF) { // valid state
                for (int k = 0; k < people.size(); k++) {
                    int cur = i;
                    for (int j = 0; j < req_skills.length; j++) {
                        for (String skill : people.get(k)) {
                            if (req_skills[j].equals(skill)) {
                                cur |= 1 << j; // set the mask
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    if (dp[cur] > dp[i] + 1) { // replace if better
                        dp[cur] = dp[i] + 1;
                        parent[cur] = i;
                        who[cur] = k;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        int[] ans = new int[dp[N - 1]];
        for (int i = 0, cur = N - 1; i < ans.length; i++) {
            ans[i] = who[cur];
            cur = parent[cur];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
