Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The code iterates through all numbers from 1 to n to find all factors of n. However, since we know that factors always come in pairs and each pair multiplies to n, we can find the first half of the factors and already have the second half.

Fix:
We can optimize the code by iterating only up to the square root of n to find the factors.
The bug is that the code currently iterates through all numbers from 1 to n which results in inefficiency when n is large.

Updated Code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {
    public int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                list.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        // Avoid adding the square root twice when n is a perfect square
        if (n % Math.sqrt(n) == 0 && Math.sqrt(n) != list.get(list.size() - 1)) {
            list.add(n / list.get(list.size() - 1));
        }

        if (list.size() < k) {
            return -1;
        }

        return list.get(k - 1);
    }
}
