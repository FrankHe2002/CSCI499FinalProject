Bug: The bug in the code is in the `inc` method when updating the `countToBucket` map. There is a missing update for the old count when it is getting replaced with a new count.

```java
//original code - inc method
if (countToBucket.containsKey(count)) { 
    newBucket = countToBucket.get(count);
    newBucket.keys.add(key);
} else {
    newBucket = bucketList.createBucketToTheRight(oldBucket, key, count);
}
//missing update for the old count if it exists
countToBucket.put(count, oldBucket); //add this line to update the old count
``` 

By adding the line `countToBucket.put(count, oldBucket);` after the condition, we can ensure that the `countToBucket` map is updated when the count already exists for a particular key.

Below is the fixed code:

```java
//fixed code - inc method
if (countToBucket.containsKey(count)) { 
    newBucket = countToBucket.get(count);
    newBucket.keys.add(key);
} else {
    newBucket = bucketList.createBucketToTheRight(oldBucket, key, count);
}
countToBucket.put(count, oldBucket); //add this line to update the old count
```

Adding this line will fix the bug and ensure that the `countToBucket` map is correctly updated when a new count is assigned to a key.
