Bug type: Logical Bug

Reasoning:
The code is aimed to calculate the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high] in a binary search tree. The issue in the code is in the `dfs` method. The algorithm has a logical flaw that leads to incorrect results in specific cases.

The logical bug comes from the unnecessary and incorrect checks if (root.val < low && root.val <= high) and the subsequent recursively calling both left and right children.

Fix:
To fix the logical bug and correctly calculate the sum of values of all nodes in the range [low, high], we need to:
- Remove the redundant condition blocks and properly check and call the `dfs` method.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    private int sum = 0;

    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        dfs(root, low, high);
        return sum;
    }

    public void dfs(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) return;

        if (root.val >= low && root.val <= high) {
            sum += root.val;
        }

        if (root.val > low) {
            dfs(root.left, low, high);
        }
        
        if (root.val < high) {
            dfs(root.right, low, high);
        }
    }
}
```
