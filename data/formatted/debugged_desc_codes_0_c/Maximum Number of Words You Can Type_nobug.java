The code logic seems to be checking if any word in the given text contains a broken letter, it decrements the count. However, there is a bug in the logic that if the first word contains a broken letter, it does not decrement the count correctly.

I will fix the bug by initializing count to 0 instead of 1.

Here's the updated code with the bug fix:

```java
// Runtime: 8 ms (Top 25.13%) | Memory: 42.1 MB (Top 88.13%)
class Solution {
    public int canBeTypedWords(String text, String brokenLetters) {
        int count = 0;  // Initialize count to 0
        boolean isBad = false;
        for (char c : text.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == ' ') {
                isBad = false;
                count++;
            } else {
                if (!isBad && brokenLetters.indexOf(c) != -1) {
                    isBad = true;
                    count--;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

The bug is fixed by initializing count to 0 instead of 1. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
