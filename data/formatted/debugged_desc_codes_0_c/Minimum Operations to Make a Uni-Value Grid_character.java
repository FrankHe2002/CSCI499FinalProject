The given code seems to be susceptible to a bug. After analyzing the code, we can conclude that the bug is likely related to the calculation of the median from the sorted array.

Reasoning process to identify and fix the bug:
1. The code creates a 1D array 'arr' to store the elements of the 2D grid and then sorts it to find the median.
2. The median is calculated as 'int median = arr[(arr.length - 1) / 2];' which is incorrect. The median should be the middle value of the sorted array for odd length and the average of the middle two values for an even length array.
3. The median value is then used to calculate the steps required to make the grid a uni-value grid. Any element that is not equal to the median should require a multiple of 'x' steps to make it equal to the median.

The bug is in the calculation of the median. The fix for this bug is to use a condition to handle cases where the size of the array is even.

Here's the modified code to fix the bug:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[][] grid, int x) {
        int[] arr = new int[grid.length * grid[0].length];
        int index = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                arr[index++] = grid[i][j];
            }
        }

        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int median;
        int len = arr.length;

        if (len % 2 == 0) {
            median = (arr[len / 2 - 1] + arr[len / 2]) / 2;
        } else {
            median = arr[len / 2];
        }

        int steps = 0;

        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num == median) {
                continue;
            }

            if (Math.abs(num - median) % x != 0) {
                return -1;
            }

            steps += (Math.abs(num - median) / x);
        }

        return steps;
    }
}
```

The changes made in the code include:
1. Modified the calculation of the median to handle even-length arrays.
2. Removed the unnecessary mathematical expression for indexing the 'arr' array.
3. The bug is fixed with minimal changes to the original structure of the code.
