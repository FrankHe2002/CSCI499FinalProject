The code provided is not valid Java code due to variable `boundary` being used before it is declared, and a typo with the variable name `boundary` being used instead of `lisSize`. There are also some issues with the initialization of variables.

Here are the bugs identified:

1. Variable `boundary` is used before it is declared.
2. In the `longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition` method, the variable `cur` is not incremented, which means the index of `ans` will not be updated correctly.
3. In the `longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition` method, the variable `lisSize` is not being set appropriately.
4. In the `longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition` method, there are inconsistent spaces around the subtraction operator.
5. In the `longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition` method, the condition `lis[boundary] <= curHeight` should be `lis[lisSize] <= curHeight`.

To fix these bugs, we need to:
- Change the variable name `boundary` to `lisSize` for consistency and proper usage.
- Fix and add increments for the `cur` and `lisSize` variables.
- Fix the condition `lis[lisSize] <= curHeight` and the inconsistent spaces around the subtraction operator.
- Declare `lisSize` and `boundary` at the relevant places.
- Remove the binary search method and directly calculate `lisSize` within the `longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition` method.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(int[] obstacles) {
        int cur = 0, lisSize;
        int[] lis = new int[obstacles.length];
        int[] ans = new int[obstacles.length];

        for (int curHeight : obstacles) {
            lisSize = cur;
            if (cur == 0 || lis[cur - 1] <= curHeight) {
                lis[cur++] = curHeight;
            } else {
                lisSize = binarySearch(lis, 0, cur - 1, curHeight);
                lis[lisSize] = curHeight;
            }

            ans[lisSize] = cur;
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private int binarySearch(int[] nums, int start, int end, int target) {
        int left = start, right = end;
        int boundary = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                boundary = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return boundary;
    }
}
```
With these fixes, the code should work correctly and return the expected results.
