The given code is supposed to find the time when the program crashes and the available memory in the two memory sticks. The code seems to have a bug where it is not allocating the memory bits correctly.

The bug in the code is in the while loop condition: `while (Math.max(memory1, memory2) <= i)`. This condition checks if the maximum available memory in both sticks is less than or equal to the current second `i`, which is incorrect. The condition should check if at least one of the memory sticks has less than `i` memory available.

To fix the bug, the condition in the while loop should be changed from `Math.max(memory1, memory2) <= i` to `memory1 >= i || memory2 >= i`.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 87.96%) | Memory: 41.8 MB (Top 45.37%)
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int i = 1;
        while (memory1 >= i || memory2 >= i) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2)
                memory1 -= i;
            else
                memory2 -= i;
            i++;
        }
        return new int[] {i, memory1, memory2};
    }
}
```
