The code is trying to find the minimum total cost for a robot to return home, but there are some bugs in the code:

1. The modulo operator '%' is used instead of the addition operator '+', which seems incorrect. This will result in the wrong calculation of the total cost.

2. The code is using an incorrect variable to access the cost of moving up or down. Instead of using 'total %= rowCosts[i];', it should use 'total += rowCosts[i];' to accumulate the cost.

3. Similarly, the code is using an incorrect variable to access the cost of moving left or right. Instead of using 'total += colCosts[i];', it should be 'total += colCosts[i];' to accumulate the cost.

To fix these bugs, I will replace the modulo operator (%) with the addition operator (+) and change the variable used to access the cost of moving up or down and the cost of moving left or right.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] startPos, int[] homePos, int[] rowCosts, int[] colCosts) {
        int total = 0;

        // if home is below the start, move down till there
        if (homePos[0] > startPos[0]) {
            int i = startPos[0] + 1;
            while (i <= homePos[0]) {
                total += rowCosts[i]; // adding cost while moving corresponding to the cell
                i++;
            }
        }

        // else if home is above the start, move up till there
        else if (homePos[0] < startPos[0]) {
            int i = startPos[0] - 1;
            while (i >= homePos[0]) {
                total += rowCosts[i]; // adding cost while moving corresponding to the cell
                i--;
            }
        }

        // if home is right to the start, move right till there
        if (homePos[1] > startPos[1]) {
            int i = startPos[1] + 1;
            while (i <= homePos[1]) {
                total += colCosts[i];  // adding cost while moving corresponding to the cell
                i++;
            }
        }

        // else if home is left to the start, move left till there
        else if (homePos[1] < startPos[1]) {
            int i = startPos[1] - 1;
            while (i >= homePos[1]) {
                total += colCosts[i];  // adding cost while moving corresponding to the cell
                i--;
            }
        }

        return total;
    }
}
```
