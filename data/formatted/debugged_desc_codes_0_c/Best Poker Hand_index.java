The bug in the code is in the for loop where the array `arr` is being populated incorrectly. The index `i` should start from 0 and not 1, and the condition `i < 5` should be `i < ranks.length` for more flexibility. Additionally, the condition to check `max` should use the incremented `i` to access `arr`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.6 MB (Top 33.75%)
class Solution {
    public String bestHand(int[] ranks, char[] suits) {
        int max = 0;
        int card = 0;
        char ch = suits[0];
        int[] arr = new int[14];
        for (int i = 0; i < ranks.length; i++) {
            arr[ranks[i]]++;
            max = Math.max(max, arr[ranks[i]]);
            if (suits[i] == ch) card++;
        }
        if (card == 5) return "Flush";
        return max >= 3 ? "Three of a Kind" : (max == 2 ? "Pair" : "High Card");
    }
}
```
