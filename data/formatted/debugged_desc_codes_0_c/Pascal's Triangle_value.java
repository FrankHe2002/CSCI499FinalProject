The code has a bug, as it generates the wrong output for numRows greater than 2 in Pascal's triangle. The issue seems to be with the indexing and iteration logic in the for loop.

To identify the bug, let's first trace the code and understand the expected output for a few sample test cases:
- For numRows = 1, the expected output is [[1]]
- For numRows = 2, the expected output is [[1], [1, 1]]
- For numRows = 3, the expected output is [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
- For numRows = 4, the expected output is [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]

Now, let's analyze the for loop in the code. The loop starts from i=1 and iterates up to numRows-1 (exclusive). This should mean that it will generate the necessary rows as per the sample test cases. However, by closely examining the logic, it seems that the loop counter and the index for accessing the rows may be off by one. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of the for loop to correctly iterate and access the elements from the previously generated rows.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> generate(int numRows) {
        List<List<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>();

        if (numRows == 0) {
            return list;
        }

        list.add(Arrays.asList(1));

        for (int i = 1; i < numRows; i++) {
            List<Integer> prevRow = list.get(i - 1);
            List<Integer> currRow = new ArrayList<>();

            currRow.add(1);
            
            for (int j = 1; j < prevRow.size(); j++) {
                currRow.add(prevRow.get(j - 1) + prevRow.get(j));
            }

            currRow.add(1);
            list.add(currRow);
        }

        return list;
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, we fixed the for loop to start from i=1 and iterate up to numRows, and then correctly accessed the previous row using get(i - 1). We also initialized the list using `ArrayList` and included a check for numRows=0.
