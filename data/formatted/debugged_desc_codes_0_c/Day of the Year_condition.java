Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is attempting to calculate the day number of the year based on the input date.
2. The code is extracting the year, month, and day from the input date and using arrays and loops to calculate the day number of the year.

Identifying the bugs:
1. The condition for the for loop is incorrect due to the '>' sign, causing the loop not to execute.
2. The leap year condition may not function correctly due to the incorrect placement of 'year % 4 == 0' and the year being compared to 1900.

Fixing the bugs:
1. Change the condition for the for loop to iterate over the months array for the correct number of iterations.
2. Correct the leap year condition to be 'if (year % 4 == 0 && year != 1900)' to ensure the years are checked accurately for leap years.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int dayOfYear(String date) {
        int[] months = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        int year = (date.charAt(0) - 48) * 1000 + (date.charAt(1) - 48) * 100 + (date.charAt(2) - 48) * 10 + date.charAt(3) - 48;
        if (year % 4 == 0 && year != 1900) {
            months[1]++;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ((date.charAt(5) - 48) * 10) + date.charAt(6) - 48 - 1; i++) {
            ans += months[i];
        }
        ans += (date.charAt(8) - 48) * 10 + date.charAt(9) - 48;
        return ans;
    }
}
