Bug type:
1. Logical Error
2. Off-by-one error
3. Math Error

Identifying the bug:
1. Review the for loop in the `sumSubarrayMins` method to ensure that the index is not an off-by-one error.
2. Review the mathematical calculations inside the for loop to verify that the calculation is correct based on the problem's requirements.

Fixing the bug:
The off-by-one error occurs in the for loop of the `sumSubarrayMins` method. The index 'i' should start at 0 (since arrays are 0-indexed), not -1. Additionally, fix the array indexing to access the correct elements.

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumSubarrayMins(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int ans1[] = nsl(arr);
        int ans2[] = nsr(arr);
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum = (sum + (long) (arr[i] * (long) (ans1[i] * ans2[i]) % 1000000007) % 1000000007) % 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) sum;
    }

    // ... (Other unchanged methods)
}
```
