The bug in the provided code is in the for loop condition where it uses `operations[1].charAt(1)` instead of `operations[i].charAt(1)`. This will cause the code to always check the second element of the operations array instead of the current index i.

To fix this bug, we need to change `operations[1]` to `operations[i]` and change the condition from `charAt(1)` to `charAt(0)` to correctly check the first character of the string.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int val = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
            if (operations[i].charAt(0) == '+') val++;
            else val--;
        }
        return val;
    }
}
```
