There are a few issues in the given code:
1. The return statements for n = 1 and n = 2 are inconsistent and do not match the given constraints.
2. There is a syntax error in the return statement for n = 2.
3. There is a logical error in the calculations for `c` and the final return statement.

To fix the issues, I will:
1. Update the return statements for n = 1 and n = 2 to align with the constraints.
2. Correct the syntax error in the return statement for n = 2 by adding a closing parenthesis.
3. Update the logic for the calculations of `c` and the final return statement to correctly calculate the number of ways houses can be placed without being adjacent to each other.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;

    public int countHousePlacements(int n) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 4;
        if (n == 2)
            return 9;

        long a = 4; // For n=1, one house can be placed on each plot on either side
        long b = 9; // For n=2, one house can be placed on each plot and one on the same plot on the other side
        long c = 0;
        
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            c = (a + b) % mod;
            a = b; // Update the values of a and b without modulo
            b = c; // Update the value of b without modulo
        }

        return (int) c; // Return c directly without squaring and taking modulo again
    }
}
```

I updated the values for `a` and `b` to match the number of ways houses can be placed for n = 1 and n = 2. I also changed the logic inside the for loop to correctly update the values of `a` and `b` and calculated `c` without additional modulo operation. Finally, the final return statement now returns `c` directly without squaring and taking modulo again.
