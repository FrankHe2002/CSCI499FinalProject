The bug in the code is in the for loop condition `i < highLimit`. Since the problem statement specifies that the highLimit is inclusive, the condition should be `i <= highLimit` for all values to be considered.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBalls(int lowLimit, int highLimit) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int count = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = lowLimit; i <= highLimit; i++) { // change the loop condition
            int value = 0;
            int temp = i;
            while (temp != 0) {
                value += temp % 10;
                temp /= 10;
            }
            map.put(value, map.getOrDefault(value, 0) + 1);
            count = map.get(value) > count ? map.get(value) : count;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

The only change is in the for loop condition, which was changed from `i < highLimit` to `i <= highLimit`. This modification ensures that all values within the specified range, including highLimit, are considered.
