The provided Java code is a straightforward implementation to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. The code iterates through the entire array and keeps track of the minimum element found so far. However, there is an issue with this implementation because it does not take into account the fact that the array is rotated.

To fix this issue, we can use a binary search approach to find the minimum element in O(log n) time.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100%) | Memory: 38.7 MB (Top 93.21%)
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        return nums[left];
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we use a while loop to perform binary search. We check the value at the middle index and compare it with the value at the right index. If the value at the middle index is greater than the value at the right index, we move the left pointer to mid + 1. Otherwise, we move the right pointer to mid. We continue this process until the left pointer is equal to the right pointer, at which point we have found the minimum element. We return the value at the left index as the result. This binary search approach runs in O(log n) time, meeting the algorithm requirements.
