Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The given code seems to implement the logic described in the code description to find the largest number of chunks needed to sort the array. The logic involves finding the maximum element from the left and the minimum element from the right and checking if the maximum element is less than or equal to the minimum element for each position to determine the chunks.

Identifying the Bug:
After reviewing the code and the provided logic, it seems that the code implementation matches the logic. Therefore, the bug must be in the logic itself.

Fixing the Bug:
Upon further inspection, it seems that the logic and the implementation are correct, and there are no apparent bugs. 

Updated Code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int maxChunksToSorted(int[] arr) {

        // 1. Generate Right min

        int[] min_from_right = new int[arr.length + 1];
        min_from_right[arr.length] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            min_from_right[i] = Math.min(arr[i], min_from_right[i + 1]);
        }

        // 2. Generate Left Max and Count chunks
        int chunk_count = 0;
        int max_cur = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            max_cur = Math.max(max_cur, arr[i]);
            if (max_cur <= min_from_right[i + 1]) {
                chunk_count++;
            }
        }

        return chunk_count;
    }
}
