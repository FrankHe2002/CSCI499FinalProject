The code looks fine, but there might be an issue with handling punctuation and spaces in the paragraph. The code is using `paragraph.replaceAll("[!?',;.]", " ").toLowerCase().split("\\s+")` to remove punctuation and split the paragraph into words. It's replacing punctuation with a space and then splitting the words using whitespace characters.

One potential issue here is that if there are multiple spaces between words or at the beginning or end of the paragraph, it may result in empty strings in the `words` array.

To fix this issue, we can modify the regex to handle multiple spaces and trim the paragraph before splitting it into words.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {

        HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        String[] words = paragraph.replaceAll("[!?',;.]+", " ").toLowerCase().trim().split("\\s+");
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (hm.containsKey(words[i]))
                hm.replace(words[i], hm.get(words[i]), hm.get(words[i]) + 1);
            else
                hm.put(words[i], 1);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < banned.length; i++)
            if (hm.containsKey(banned[i]))
                hm.remove(banned[i]);

        return Collections.max(hm.entrySet(), Map.Entry.comparingByValue()).getKey();
    }
}
```

In this fix, I've updated the regex from `"\\s+"` to `"[!?',;.]+"` for the `replaceAll` method to handle multiple punctuation characters, and then I've added `trim()` to the `paragraph` to remove any leading or trailing spaces before splitting into words.
