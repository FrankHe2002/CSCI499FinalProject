The identified bug in the provided code is a syntax error. The variable `left` is not correctly initialized in the `minSubArrayLen` method. The code `int left = 0` is missing a semicolon at the end of the line.

To identify the bug, I reviewed the code and scanned for syntax errors. I noticed that the line `int left = 0` was not terminated with a semicolon.

To fix the bug, I will add a semicolon to the end of the line initializing the `left` variable.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int left = 0; // Added semicolon
        int n = nums.length;
        int sum = 0;
        int minCount = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            while (sum >= target) {
                minCount = Math.min(minCount, i - left + 1);
                sum -= nums[left++];
            }
        }
        return minCount == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minCount;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by adding a semicolon to initialize the `left` variable.
