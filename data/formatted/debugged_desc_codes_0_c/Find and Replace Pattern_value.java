The bug in the provided code is a logical error in the iteration and comparison process of mapping characters from the words to the pattern.

Here is the reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. In the for loop that iterates over the characters of the word, the loop condition is incorrect. Instead of `i < word.length()`, it should be `i < pattern.length()` because we need to iterate based on the length of the pattern.

2. Inside the loop, the condition to check if the character has already been mapped is `if (map.get(ch) == null)`. If the map does not contain the character, it means it hasn't been mapped yet. If the condition is true, it should add the mapping to the map and the character to the set.

3. If the word character `word.charAt(i)` is already in the set, it means it has been mapped before. In this case, it should check if the map contains the pattern character `ch` and if the mapped character in the map is not equal to the character in the word. If this condition is true, it should break and move to the next word.

4. Finally, after the loop completes, if `i` is equal to `pattern.length()`, it means that the mapping is successfully done, and the word should be added to the result.

5. Add the necessary imports for `List`, `ArrayList`, `Map`, `HashMap`, and `Set`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public List<String> findAndReplacePattern(String[] words, String pattern) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            Map<Character, Character> map = new HashMap<>();
            Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
            int i = 0;
            for (; i < pattern.length(); i++) {
                char ch = pattern.charAt(i);
                if (!map.containsKey(ch)) {
                    if (set.contains(word.charAt(i))) break;
                    map.put(ch, word.charAt(i));
                    set.add(word.charAt(i));
                } else {
                    char mc = map.get(ch);
                    if (mc != word.charAt(i)) break;
                }
            }
            if (i == pattern.length()) result.add(word);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
