The code provided seems to have a bug in the logic where it calculates the length of the longest continuous substring. This calculation would not accurately count all unique non-empty substrings in p that are present in the wraparound string.

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic for tracking the length of the longest continuous substring and the calculation of unique non-empty substrings in p that are present in the wraparound string.

Here is the modified code with fixes included:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findSubstringInWraproundString(String p) {
        final int N = p.length();
        int res = 0;
        int[] counts = new int[26];

        int[] maxLength = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            char ch = p.charAt(i);
            if (i > 0 && (p.charAt(i - 1) == 'z' && ch == 'a' || ch - p.charAt(i - 1) == 1)) {
                res = Math.max(res, ++maxLength[ch - 'a']);
            } else {
                res = Math.max(res, 1);
                maxLength[ch - 'a'] = 1;
            }
        }
        for (int count : maxLength) {
            res += count;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The fixes involved introducing a new array (`maxLength`) to store the length of the longest continuous substring for each character in `p`. The logic for counting the length and updating `res` was modified to keep track of the maximum length of continuous substrings. Finally, the result was calculated by summing up the counts stored in `maxLength` array.

These changes address the bug in the original code and provide the correct calculation for the number of unique non-empty substrings in p present in the wraparound string.
