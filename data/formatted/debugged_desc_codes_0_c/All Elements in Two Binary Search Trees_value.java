The code contains a bug. Specifically, when popping the elements from the stack, it pops from the wrong stack in the else clause.

Here is the step-by-step process of identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The code uses two stacks, `st1` and `st2`, to perform an inorder traversal on the two binary search trees `root1` and `root2`.
2. The code initializes an empty result list `res`.
3. It then enters a while loop that continues until both trees have been completely traversed and both stacks are empty.
4. Inside the while loop, it uses two while loops to push the left children of `root1` and `root2` onto the respective stacks.
5. After pushing the left children onto the stacks, the code checks if the `st2` stack is empty or if the value at the top of `st1` is less than or equal to the value at the top of `st2`. If so, it adds the value at the top of `st1` to the result list and pops it, updating `root1` to its right child. Otherwise, it adds the value at the top of `st2` to the result list and pops it, updating `root2` to its right child.
6. However, in the else clause, it incorrectly pops from `st1` instead of `st2`, potentially leading to incorrect results.

The fix for the bug involves correcting the line of code inside the else clause to pop from `st2` instead of `st1`.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getAllElements(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        Stack<TreeNode> st1 = new Stack<>();
        Stack<TreeNode> st2 = new Stack<>();

        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

        while (root1 != null || root2 != null || !st1.empty() || !st2.empty()) {
            while (root1 != null) {
                st1.push(root1);
                root1 = root1.left;
            }
            while (root2 != null) {
                st2.push(root2);
                root2 = root2.left;
            }
            if (st2.empty() || (!st1.empty() && st1.peek().val <= st2.peek().val)) {
                root1 = st1.pop();
                res.add(root1.val);
                root1 = root1.right;
            } else {
                root2 = st2.pop(); // Updated this line to pop from st2
                res.add(root2.val);
                root2 = root2.right;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
