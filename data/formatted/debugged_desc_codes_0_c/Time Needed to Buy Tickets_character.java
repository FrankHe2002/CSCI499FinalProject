The given code has several issues:

1. Missing semicolon after assigning the value to the variable n in line 6.
2. The calculation for the time taken to buy tickets is incorrect.

I will fix the identified issues and adjust the logic to calculate the time taken to buy tickets.

Here's the updated code with the fixes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int timeRequiredToBuy(int[] tickets, int k) {
        int n = tickets.length;
        int time = 0;

        if (tickets[k] == 1) return 1;
        while (true) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (tickets[i] > 0) {
                    tickets[i] = tickets[i] - 1;
                    time++;
                    if (i == k && tickets[i] == 0) return time;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I made the following changes:
1. Added a semicolon after assigning the value to the variable n in line 6.
2. Changed the while condition to `while (true)` since the loop is intended to run indefinitely until the correct time is found.
3. Updated the for loop to continue until the person at position k has finished buying all their tickets and then return the total time taken.
