The bug in the provided Java code is in the formula used to determine if the square is white or black. The formula should be modified to fix the bug.

To identify and fix the bug, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to understand the logic used to determine if the square is white or black. The formula in the code is using the ASCII values of the characters and performing arithmetic operations to determine the color of the square.

2. The formula `(coordinates.charAt(0) - 'a' / coordinates.charAt(1) - '0') % 2 == 0` is incorrect because the arithmetic operations are not correctly handling the coordinates.

3. We need to fix the formula to correctly determine if the square is white or black based on the given coordinates.

4. We should modify the formula to retrieve the numerical values of the coordinates and then determine if the sum of the numerical values is even or odd, which will indicate the color of the square.

Based on the understanding of the problem and bug in the code, we can apply the fix as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean squareIsWhite(String coordinates) {
        int x = coordinates.charAt(0) - 'a' + 1; // Convert letter coordinate to numerical value
        int y = coordinates.charAt(1) - '0'; // Convert number coordinate to numerical value
        return (x + y) % 2 == 0; // Check if the sum of the numerical values is even
    }
}
```

We fixed the bug by updating the formula to correctly convert the coordinates to numerical values and then check if the sum of the numerical values is even to determine the color of the square.
