The identified issues are as follows:

1. The loop condition for the 'for' loop should be 'i <= n' instead of 'i > n'.
2. The modulo operation is applied after the subtraction; it should be applied to each operation separately.
3. The subtraction is incorrectly applied for 'shareToday -= forgets[i] % mod' and 'peopleKnow -= forgets[i] % mod'. It should be logically 'shareToday -= forgets[i]' and 'peopleKnow -= forgets[i]' respectively.
4. The modulo operation for updating 'shares[i + delay]' and 'forgets[i + forget]' should be extracted into separate statements.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int peopleAwareOfSecret(int n, int delay, int forget) {
        long mod = 1000000007L;
        long[] shares = new long[n + 1];
        long[] forgets = new long[n + 1];

        if (delay < n) {
            shares[delay + 1] = 1;
        }
        if (forget < n) {
            forgets[forget + 1] = 1;
        }

        long shareToday = 0;
        long peopleKnow = 1;
        for (int i = delay; i <= n; i++) {
            shareToday = (shareToday + shares[i]) % mod;
            shareToday = (shareToday - forgets[i] + mod) % mod;

            peopleKnow = (peopleKnow - forgets[i] + mod) % mod;
            peopleKnow = (peopleKnow + shareToday) % mod;

            if (i + delay < n + 1) {
                shares[i + delay] = (shares[i + delay] + shareToday) % mod;
            }
            if (i + forget < n + 1) {
                forgets[i + forget] = (forgets[i + forget] + shareToday) % mod;
            }
        }

        return (int) peopleKnow;
    }
}
```
