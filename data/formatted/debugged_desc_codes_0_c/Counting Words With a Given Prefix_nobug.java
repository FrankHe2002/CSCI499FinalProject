The given Java code is attempting to count the number of strings in the array `words` that contain the `pref` string as a prefix. The code iterates through each string in the array `words` and uses the `indexOf` method to check if `pref` is a prefix of the current string.

However, the bug in the code is that the `indexOf` method checks for the occurrence of the `pref` string at any position in the input string, not just at the beginning. This means that the current implementation will count instances where `pref` appears anywhere in the string, not just at the beginning.

To fix this bug, the code should check if the index returned by `indexOf` is 0, which indicates that `pref` is a prefix of the string.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int prefixCount(String[] words, String pref) {
        int c = 0;
        for (String s : words) {
            if (s.indexOf(pref) == 0)
                c++;
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```

The fix involves a simple condition check within the loop that ensures the index returned by `indexOf(pref)` is 0 before incrementing the count `c`. This change should resolve the bug and accurately count the number of strings in `words` that contain `pref` as a prefix.
