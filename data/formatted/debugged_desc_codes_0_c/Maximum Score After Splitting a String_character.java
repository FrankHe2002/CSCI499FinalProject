Bug Type: Syntax error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses the `replace` method to remove '1's in the left substring and '0's in the right substring. However, the method calls are not correctly formatted.
2. The `replace` method should be followed by `.` to call it on the string object, and its closing parenthesis should be placed after the closing quotation mark of the specified character.
3. After fixing the syntax error, it is necessary to add the lengths of the modified substrings to find the maximum score.

Fix:
Correct the syntax error by adding a dot (.) after each substring and move the closing parenthesis for the `replace` method to the appropriate position. Also, add the lengths of the modified substrings to find the maximum score.
