Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
1. The code seems to be trying to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm, which keeps track of the maximum subarray sum ending at each index.
2. The variable "currmax" is updated incorrectly. It should be reset to 0 when it becomes negative, not when it becomes positive.

Fix:
Initialize `currmax` to `nums[0]` instead of `0` to handle the case when all the numbers are negative.
Update the `for` loop to start with `1` instead of `0` since we have already set `gmax` to `nums[0`.
Set `currmax` to 0 when it becomes negative, not when it becomes positive.

The fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int currmax = nums[0];
        int gmax = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            currmax = Math.max(nums[i], currmax + nums[i]);
            gmax = Math.max(gmax, currmax);
        }
        return gmax;
    }
}
```
