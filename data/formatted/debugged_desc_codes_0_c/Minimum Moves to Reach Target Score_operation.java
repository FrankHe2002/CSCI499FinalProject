There seems to be a bug in the given code. Let's analyze the code step by step and identify the bug:

1. The function `minMoves` takes two integer arguments `target` and `maxDoubles`.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0. 
3. Then, it enters a for loop where it goes from 0 to `maxDoubles - 1`.
4. Inside the loop, it checks if `target` is equal to 1. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
5. If `target` is even, it increments `ans` by 1 and updates `target` as `target % 2`.
6. If `target` is odd, it increments `ans` by 2 and updates `target` as `(target - 1) / 2`.
7. Finally, it returns `ans + target - 1`.

It seems that there are issues with the updates to the `target` variable. 

- In the case of `target` being even, the update to `target` should be `target = target / 2`, not `target = (target) % 2`.
- In the case of `target` being odd, the update to `target` should be `target = (target - 1) / 2`, not `target = (target - 1) / 2`.

Let's fix these issues:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int target, int maxDoubles) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < maxDoubles; i++) {
            if (target == 1) break;

            if (target % 2 == 0) {
                ans += 1;
                target = target / 2; // Fixed the update for even target
            } else {
                ans += 2;
                target = (target - 1) / 2; // Fixed the update for odd target
            }
        }
        return ans + target - 1;
    }
}
```
I have modified the code to fix the issues in the updates to the `target` variable. Now the code should work as expected.
