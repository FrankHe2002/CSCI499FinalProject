Bug: The bug in the given code is in the frequency calculation of the characters in the input string s. The code incorrectly calculates the frequency and creates a frequency array using 'a' as the base index. This causes incorrect frequency calculations and ultimately leads to incorrect results.

Fix:
1. Create a new frequency array based on the actual frequency of each character in the input string.
2. Use a HashMap to store the frequency of each character in the string.
3. Then iterate through the values of the HashMap to check for duplicate frequencies and count the number of characters that need to be deleted.

Here's the modified code with the fix applied:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Calculate the frequency of each character in the string
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequencyMap.put(ch, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequencyCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Iterate over the frequencies and count the number of characters that need to be deleted
        for (int freq : frequencyMap.values()) {
            frequencyCount.put(freq, frequencyCount.getOrDefault(freq, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (int freq : frequencyCount.keySet()) {
            int count = frequencyCount.get(freq);
            while (count > 1) {
                freq--;
                ans++;
                count--;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
