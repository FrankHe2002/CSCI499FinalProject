Bug Type: Incorrect Mathematical Calculation

Reasoning:
The initial code calculates the squared distances between the rectangle and the circle. However, it incorrectly compares the sum of these squared distances to the square of the circle's radius. This directly compares the sum of the squares of the distances rather than the actual distances. The code needs to calculate the actual distances before comparing with the squared radius.

Fix:
1. Remove the sum of squared distances calculation and store the closest x and y coordinates inside variables.
2. Calculate the squared distance between the closest point and the circle's center using Math.pow() for both x and y, similar to the initial code.
3. Return the comparison of the sum of squared distances being less than the circle's radius squared.
