The given code calculates and returns the minimum number of operations required to form the target array from the initial array. The approach employed in the code considers the difference between consecutive elements and adds the difference to the result. The code appears to be logically sound, and the given explanations and examples are consistent with the approach used.

After analyzing the code and understanding the problem statement, it seems that the code does not have any bugs. The approach is straightforward and does not contain any obvious errors.

Therefore, no bug fixes are required for the given code.

The code is presented in the required markdown format:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
        int res = 0;
        int prev = 0;
        for (int cur : target) {
            if (cur > prev) {
                res += cur - prev;
            }
            prev = cur;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
