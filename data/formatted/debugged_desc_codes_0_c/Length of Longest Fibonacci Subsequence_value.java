The given code is a solution to find the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence in the given array. The algorithm uses dynamic programming to keep track of the length of the Fibonacci series ending at each pair of indices.

Upon reviewing the code, the logic and algorithm seem correct. However, there is a logical error in the return statement. In Java, adding an integer to a boolean results in an integer value. So the line `return result + 2 >= 3 ? result + 2 : 0;` essentially checks if `result + 2` is greater than or equal to `3`, and if so, returns `result + 2`, otherwise returns `0`.

To fix this issue, the return statement logic should be fixed to correctly check if `result + 2` is greater than or equal to `3` before adding the ternary operation.

Here's the updated code with the fixed return statement:

```java
public int lenLongestFibSubseq(int[] A) {
    int n = A.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
    int result = 0;
    for (int k = 2; k < n; k++) {
        int i = 0, j = k - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            int sum = A[i] + A[j] - A[k];
            if (sum < 0) {
                i++;
            } else if (sum > 0) {
                j--;
            } else {
                // ith, jth kth element are fibbonaci sequence
                dp[j][k] = dp[i][j] + 1; // since numbers are unique
                result = Math.max(result, dp[j][k]);
                i++;
                j--;
            }
        }
    }
    return result >= 2 ? result + 2 : 0;
}
```
After applying the fix, the logic error in the original return statement has been resolved. The fixed return statement now checks if `result` is greater than or equal to `2` before adding `2` to it, otherwise returns `0`.
