The given code is using binary search to find the smallest character in the array that is larger than the target. 

The bug in the code is in the calculation of the variable 'end' in the while loop. The initial value of 'end' should be letters.length - 1 instead of letters.length - 2.

To fix the bug, I will update the initial value of 'end' and also update the comparison operation in the while loop to start < end.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int start = 0, end = letters.length - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] > target) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return letters[start % letters.length];
    }
}
```
