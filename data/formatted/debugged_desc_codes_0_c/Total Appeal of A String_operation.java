The code looks correct at first glance, but there is a bug in the way the appeal of all substrings is being calculated. The bug is likely in the line that calculates the appeal of each substring:

```java
res += (i + prev) * (long) (n - i);
```

Let's think through the process step by step to identify and fix the bug:

1. For each character in the string, the code is calculating the appeal based on the current index `i`, and the previous occurrence of the character `prev`.
2. The formula `(i + prev) * (long) (n - i)` is attempting to calculate the number of substrings that can be formed that include the current character.
3. However, the formula is incorrect because it is counting the total number of substrings, not the number of distinct characters in each substring.

The bug is in the formula for calculating the appeal of each substring. The correct approach should be to calculate the number of substrings that include the current character and multiply it by the number of distinct characters in that substring.

To fix the bug, we need to update the formula to correctly calculate the number of distinct characters in each substring and adjust the code as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public long appealSum(String s) {
        long res = 0;
        char[] cs = s.toCharArray();
        int n = cs.length;
        int[] pos = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(pos, - 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int j = cs[i] - 'a';
            int prev = pos[j];
            int substrLen = i - prev; // Calculate length of the substring
            res += substrLen * (n - i); // Multiply by the remaining length of the string
            pos[j] = i;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

By fixing the formula to calculate the number of distinct characters in each substring and adjusting the code accordingly, the bug should now be resolved.

The corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long appealSum(String s) {
        long res = 0;
        char[] cs = s.toCharArray();
        int n = cs.length;
        int[] pos = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(pos, - 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int j = cs[i] - 'a';
            int prev = pos[j];
            int substrLen = i - prev; // Calculate length of the substring
            res += substrLen * (n - i); // Multiply by the remaining length of the string
            pos[j] = i;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
