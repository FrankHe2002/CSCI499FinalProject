Bug type: Logical Error

The logical error in the code is in the comparison of board values, specifically in this line: 

```java
if (((board[0][0] ^ board[colToMove][0]) ^ (board[i][j] ^ board[0][j])) == 1) {
    return -1;
}
```

The code tries to identify whether the board is a chessboard by comparing the XOR of various board values to 1. However, the comparison logic may not accurately identify a valid chessboard.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly check for a valid chessboard configuration. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
if ((board[0][0] ^ board[i][0] ^ board[0][j] ^ board[i][j]) == 1) {
    return -1;
}
```
After making this change, the code will accurately check for a valid chessboard configuration and return the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a chessboard board.
