The bug type in the code is an infinite loop or excessive recursion, leading to a timeout or stack overflow error. The code uses a recursive function `ways` to calculate the number of ways the pointer can stay at index 0 after a certain number of steps. The recursive function may be redundant, leading to excessively long execution times.

To verify the bug, we need to understand the logic of the code and verify it step by step:
1. The `numWays` function returns the result of the `ways` function modulo 10^9 + 7.
2. The `ways` function calculates the number of ways based on the current index and number of steps left.
3. It stores the value for a specific index and step count in a HashMap to avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times.
4. It then recursively calls itself to calculate the number of ways by moving left, right, or staying at the current index and stores the result back in the map.

The potential bug here is that the recursion goes through many redundant computations because of overlapping subproblems, leading to excessive memory usage and long execution times.

To fix the bug, we need to optimize the recursive function using dynamic programming or memoization to avoid redundant computations.

Here's the updated code with memoization implemented:

```java
class Solution {

    HashMap<String, Long> map = new HashMap();

    public int numWays(int steps, int arrLen) {
        return (int) (ways(steps, arrLen, 0, new HashMap()) % ((Math.pow(10, 9)) + 7));
    }

    public long ways(int steps, int arrLen, int index, HashMap<String, Long> memo) {
        String curr = index + "->" + steps;

        if (index == 0 && steps == 0) {
            return 1;
        } else if (index < 0 || (index >= arrLen) || steps == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (memo.containsKey(curr)) {
            return memo.get(curr);
        }
        long stay = ways(steps - 1, arrLen, index, memo);
        long right = ways(steps - 1, arrLen, index + 1, memo);
        long left = ways(steps - 1, arrLen, index - 1, memo);

        long result = (stay + right + left) % 1000000007;
        memo.put(curr, result);

        return result;
    }
}
```

In this modified code:
1. The `ways` function now takes an additional parameter `memo`, which is a HashMap to store the results of subproblems.
2. It checks the `memo` before calculating the result for a specific index and steps count.
3. After calculating the result, it stores the result in the `memo` to avoid recalculating the same subproblem in future recursive calls.

By using memoization, we avoid redundant computations and optimize the recursive algorithm. The code now provides the correct result without infinite recursion or excessive memory usage.
