The code has a bug in the `else if (currentString != "")` block at the end of the `util` method. There is a missing semicolon at the end of the line `currentSet = new ArrayList<>()`.

Fix:

```java
currentSet = new ArrayList<>(); // Added semicolon at the end
```

This will ensure that the `currentSet` is properly initialized with a new ArrayList.
