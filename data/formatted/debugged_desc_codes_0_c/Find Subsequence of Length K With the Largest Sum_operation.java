Bug type: Logical error

The program uses a PriorityQueue to store the elements of the array nums along with their index. Then, it retrieves the k largest elements using poll on the PriorityQueue. However, the line `Collections.sort(l, (a, b) -> a[1] % b[1]);` seems to have a logical error as it's trying to sort based on the modulo of two elements' indices, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this issue, the sort should be based on the element's index itself to keep the order consistent with the original array.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] maxSubsequence(int[] nums, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            pq.offer(new int[] {nums[i], i});

        List<int[]> l = new ArrayList<>();

        while (k-- != 0)
            l.add(pq.poll());

        // Corrected sorting based on the index
        Collections.sort(l, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);

        int[] res = new int[l.size()];

        int index = 0;

        for (int[] i : l)
            res[index++] = i[0];

        return res;
    }
}
```
