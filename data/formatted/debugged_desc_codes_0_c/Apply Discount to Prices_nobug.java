There is a bug in the provided code. The issue occurs in the calculation of the discounted price. The `calc` method is incorrectly calculating the discounted price.

Here's how the bug can be identified and fixed:

1. The `calc` method is where the discounted price is calculated. The calculation is incorrect because it subtracts the discount from the original price instead of calculating the discounted price.

2. To fix the bug, the `calc` method should be modified to calculate the discounted price correctly.

Here's the modified code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {

    public String discountPrices(String sentence, int discount) {
        String x[] = sentence.split(" ");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String s : x) {
            if (isPrice(s)) sb.append(calc(Double.parseDouble(s.substring(1)), discount) + " ");
            else sb.append(s + " ");
        }
        sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
        return sb.toString();
    }

    boolean isPrice(String s) {
        return s.startsWith("$") && s.substring(1).matches("\\d+");
    }

    // Fixed calc method to calculate the discounted price
    String calc(double num, double discount) {
        double ans = num - (num * discount / 100.00); // Calculate the discounted price
        return "$" + String.format("%.2f", ans);
    }
}
```
