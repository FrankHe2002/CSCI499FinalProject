The identified buggy part is in the `while` loop within the `pickIndex` method. Here are the reasons why:

1. The algorithm for generating a random number in the range [1, total sum of weights] seems fine.
2. The issue is with the binary search logic in the while loop. There's a bug in the 'else' block: `left = mid + 2` should be `left = mid + 1`.

Explanation for fixing the bug:
The above mentioned issue indicates that when `num` is greater than `prefixSum[mid]`, there's an issue in the assignment causing the while loop to skip a few indexes, which may result in incorrect index selection.

To fix this issue, the code inside the `else` block of the while loop in the `pickIndex` method should be updated from `left = mid + 2` to `left = mid + 1`.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {

    private int[] prefixSum;
    private Random random;

    public Solution(int[] w) {
        for (int i = 1; i < w.length; i++)
            w[i] += w[i - 1];
        prefixSum = w;
        random = new Random();
    }

    public int pickIndex() {
        int num = 1 + random.nextInt(prefixSum[prefixSum.length - 1]); // Generate random number between 1 and total sum of weights
        int left = 0;
        int right = prefixSum.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (num == prefixSum[mid])
                return mid;
            else if (num < prefixSum[mid])
                right = mid;
            else
                left = mid + 1;  // Fix the bug here from left = mid + 2 to left = mid + 1
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
