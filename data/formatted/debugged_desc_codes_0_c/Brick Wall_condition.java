The code seems to be iterating through each row and each brick inside a row and calculating the frequency of each edge position. It then returns the number of rows minus the frequency of the most occurring edge. 

One issue that may exist in the code is the calculation of the edge position. Since the problem states that the total width of each row is the same, there should be no cumulative addition of brick lengths to get the edge position. The edge position should be the cumulative sum of the brick lengths of the current row only, not the cumulative sum of previous rows as well.

To fix this, we need to keep track of the cumulative sum of the brick lengths within each row only.

Here's the updated code reflecting the fix:

```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 21.1%) | Memory: 46.16 MB (Top 61.8%)

class Solution {
    public int leastBricks(List<List<Integer>> wall) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> edge_frequency = new HashMap<>(); // HashMap to store the number of common edges among the rows
        int max_frequency = 0; // Variable to store the frequency of most occurring edge

        for (List<Integer> rowBricks : wall) { // Iterating through each row
            int edge_position = 0; // Variable to store different edge positions

            for (int i = 0; i < rowBricks.size() - 1; i++) { // Iterating through each brick inside a row
                edge_position += rowBricks.get(i); // Cumulative sum of brick lengths within the row
                edge_frequency.put(edge_position, edge_frequency.getOrDefault(edge_position, 0) + 1); // Incrementing the frequency of just calculated edge position
                max_frequency = Math.max(edge_frequency.get(edge_position), max_frequency); // Comparing the frequency of just calculated edge position with max frequency seen till now & storing whichever is greater.
            }
        }
        return wall.size() - max_frequency; // Returning (Number of Bricks Crossed by Line) i.e. (Number of Rows in Wall - Frequency of Most Occurring Edge)
    }
}
```

This code adjusts the calculation of the edge position inside the inner loop to only consider the cumulative sum of the brick lengths within the current row, as required by the problem statement.
