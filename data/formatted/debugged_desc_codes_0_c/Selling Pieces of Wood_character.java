The given code uses dynamic programming to return the maximum money you can earn after cutting an m x n piece of wood. However, there seems to be a logical bug in the code that prevents it from correctly computing the maximum money that can be earned.

Let's start by reviewing the logic of the code and identifying the bug:

1. The `sellingWood` method initializes a 2D array `dp` of size (m+1) x (n+1) to store the maximum money that can be earned for different dimensions of wood.
2. It then populates the `dp` array with the prices from the input array, using the wood dimensions as indices.
3. The code then iterates over the dimensions of the wood and for each dimension, it tries all possible horizontal cuts and vertical cuts to maximize the profit.
4. Finally, it returns the value stored in `dp[m][n]`, which represents the maximum money that can be earned by cutting an m x n piece of wood.

There is a bug in the logic of the code. It is missing a closing bracket for the second for loop, leading to a syntax error. Additionally, the calculation of maximum money using horizontal and vertical cuts seems incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to:
- Add the missing closing bracket for the second for loop.
- Correct the logic for calculating the maximum money by considering all valid combinations of horizontal and vertical cuts.

The corrected code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public long sellingWood(int m, int n, int[][] prices) {
        long[][] dp = new long[m + 1][n + 1];
        for (int[] price : prices) {
            dp[price[0]][price[1]] = price[2];
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n + 1; j++) {
                // all horizontal
                for (int k = 1; k < i; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[k][j] + dp[i - k][j]);
                }
                // all vertical
                for (int k = 1; k < j; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[i][j - k]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the `for` loop conditions for `k` have been changed from `k <= i/2` and `k <= j/2` to `k < i` and `k < j` respectively to consider all valid cut sizes.

This change ensures that the code correctly calculates the maximum money that can be earned after cutting an m x n piece of wood.
