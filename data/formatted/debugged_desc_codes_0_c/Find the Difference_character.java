The code provided seems to be trying to find the added letter in string t by using bitwise XOR to cancel out the common letters between the two strings.

The bug in the code is a missing closing parenthesis in the first for loop. The statement `for (char cs : s.toCharArray() c ^= cs;` needs to be fixed by adding a closing parenthesis after `s.toCharArray()`.

Also, `char c` needs to be initialized to a value, either `char c = 0;` or `char c = 'a';` depending on the context of the problem, before performing the bitwise XOR operation.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for (char cs : s.toCharArray()) {
            c ^= cs;
        }
        for (char ct : t.toCharArray()) {
            c ^= ct;
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```
