The code logic for the RangeModule class looks correct, and it should work as intended. However, there is a potential bug in the `addRange` method where the `l2` value is used without checking for its existence.

To fix this potential bug, we need to add a null check for `l2` before using it. We also need to change `map.get(l2)` to `l2` in the line `map.put(l1, Math.max(right, map.get(l2)));` to use the correct value.

Here's the modified `addRange` method with the fix applied:

```java
public void addRange(int left, int right) {
    Integer l1 = map.floorKey(left);
    Integer l2 = map.floorKey(right);

    // Add a null check for l2 before using it
    if (l2 != null) {
        if (l1 != null && map.get(l1) >= left) {
            // Change map.get(l2) to l2
            map.put(l1, Math.max(right, l2));
        } else {
            map.put(left, Math.max(right, l2));
        }
    } else {
        map.put(left, right);
    }
    map.subMap(left, false, right, true).clear();
}
```

With this modification, the potential bug is fixed, and the RangeModule class should work as expected.
