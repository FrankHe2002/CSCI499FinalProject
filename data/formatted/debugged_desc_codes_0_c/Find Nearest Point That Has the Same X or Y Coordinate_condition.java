The given Java code seems to be logically correct. It is iterating through the points array, calculating the Manhattan distance for each point, and updating the minimum distance and index accordingly.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that there are no obvious bugs in the code. The logic seems sound, and the constraints are being checked. The only thing to point out is that the commented out code `// if ( min== Integer.MAX_VALUE) return -1;` is unnecessary because `index` is already initialized as -1 in the declaration.

Therefore, no bug is identified, and the code seems correct.

Code with unnecessary commented line removed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int nearestValidPoint(int x, int y, int[][] points) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, index = - 1, i;

        for (i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (x == points[i][0] || y == points[i][1]) {
                int d = Math.abs(x - points[i][0]) + Math.abs(y - points[i][1]);
                if (d <= min) {
                    min = d;
                    index = i;
                }
            }

        }
        return index;
    }
}
```
