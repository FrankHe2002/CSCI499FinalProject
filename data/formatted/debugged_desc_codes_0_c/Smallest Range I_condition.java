Bug type: Logical error.

The bug in the code is in the if condition `if (nums.length != 1)`. The code should not return 0 if the length of the `nums` array is not equal to 1. This condition is incorrect because the problem statement does not specify that the length of the `nums` array should be exactly 1. The code should return the minimum score of `nums`, regardless of its length.

Furthermore, in the formula `diff - 2 * k`, it is calculating the maximum value that can be added and subtracted from the min and max numbers in the array. Instead, we need to calculate the value of k that needs to be added or subtracted from the numbers in the array such that the difference between min and max is minimized.

Here's the modified code with the bug fixed:

```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 41.38%) | Memory: 50.1 MB (Top 6.90%)

class Solution {
    public int smallestRangeI(int[] nums, int k) {
        int min = nums[0];
        int max = nums[0];

        for (int num : nums) {
            min = Math.min(min, num);
            max = Math.max(max, num);
        }
        
        int diff = max - min - 2 * k;
        return diff < 0 ? 0 : diff;
    }
}
```

In the modified code:
1. Removed the if condition `if (nums.length != 1)`.
2. Corrected the calculation of `diff` by subtracting `2 * k` from the difference between max and min.
3. Returned 0 if `diff` is less than 0.
