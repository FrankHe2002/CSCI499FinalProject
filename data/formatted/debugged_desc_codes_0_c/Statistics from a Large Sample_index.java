Bug type: Logical error

The code seems to be trying to calculate the statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode) of a sample represented by an array of integers. 

Upon review, the following issues have been identified in the code:
1. The index of the array `ans` is being accessed incorrectly. The correct indices should be used to store the results.
2. The formula for calculating the mean is incorrect. It should be the sum of (count[i] * i) divided by the total countEl.
3. The median is being incorrectly calculated for both odd and even countEl.

To fix the issues, the following changes need to be made:
1. Initialize the array `ans` as an array of size 5 instead of 3 to accommodate all the statistics.
2. Use the correct indices for storing the results in the `ans` array.
3. Fix the calculation of the mean as described above.
4. Correct the calculation of the median for both odd and even countEl.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double[] sampleStats(int[] count) {
        double[] ans = new double[5];
        ans[0] = -1;
        ans[1] = -1;
        ans[2] = 0; // mean
        ans[3] = -1; // median
        ans[4] = 0; // mode

        int countEl = 0, mode = 0, maxCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {
            if (count[i] > 0) {
                if (ans[0] == -1) {
                    ans[0] = i; // minimum
                }
                ans[1] = i;  // maximum

                ans[2] += i * count[i]; // mean

                countEl += count[i];

                if (count[i] > maxCount) {
                    mode = i;
                    maxCount = count[i];
                }
            }
        }

        ans[2] /= countEl;  // mean

        int medianCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {
            medianCount += count[i];
            if (medianCount >= (countEl + 1) / 2) {
                if (countEl % 2 == 1 && medianCount >= (countEl + 1) / 2) {
                    ans[3] = i;  // median for odd countEl
                    break;
                } else {
                    if (ans[3] == -1 && medianCount >= (countEl + 1) / 2) {
                        ans[3] = i;  // first value for even countEl
                    } else if (medianCount >= (countEl + 1) / 2 + 1) {
                        ans[3] = (ans[3] + i) / 2.0;  // average for even countEl
                        break;
                    }
                }

            }
        }

        ans[4] = mode;  // mode

        return ans;
    }
}
