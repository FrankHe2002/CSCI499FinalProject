The bug in the provided code lies in the declaration of the frequency array `int[] freq = new int[27];`. The size of the array should be 26, not 27, as there are 26 lowercase English letters.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The code initializes the frequency array with a size of 27, possibly due to a typo or misunderstanding.
2. We need to declare the frequency array with a size of 26 to cover all lowercase English letters.
3. We can fix the bug by changing the size of the frequency array from 27 to 26.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areOccurrencesEqual(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[26]; // Fixed the size of the frequency array

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) freq[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;

        int val = freq[s.charAt(0) - 'a'];
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
            if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != val) return false;

        return true;
    }
}
```
