The provided code has a bug in the `countVowels` method. The bug is in the calculation of the count of vowels in every substring of the word.

To identify and fix the bug, follow these steps:

1. The initial value of `count` should be 0 to store the sum of the number of vowels in every substring of the word.

2. The `count` variable should be incremented by the length of the substring each time a vowel is found.

3. You need to calculate the count of vowels in every substring of the word by using nested loops to iterate over all possible substrings.

4. The calculation should add 1 to the count for every vowel in each substring.

5. Update the return type of the method to `int` since the constraint mentions the result will fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    boolean isVowel(char ch) {
        return ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'u';
    }

    public int countVowels(String word) {
        int count = 0;
        int len = word.length();

        for (int start = 0; start < len; start++) {
            for (int end = start; end < len; end++) {
                for (int pos = start; pos <= end; pos++) {
                    if (isVowel(word.charAt(pos))) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, I have corrected the `countVowels` method to correctly calculate the count of vowels in every substring of the word. Additionally, I have changed the return type of the `countVowels` method from `long` to `int`, as the expected result needs to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.
