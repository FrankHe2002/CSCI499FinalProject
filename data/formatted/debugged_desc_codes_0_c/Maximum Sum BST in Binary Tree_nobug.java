The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the logic for checking whether a subtree is a Binary Search Tree (BST). Upon further examination, it appears that the condition `root.val > left[1] && root.val < right[0]` in the `solve` method is checking the wrong values. The correct conditions should be `root.val > left[1] && root.val < right[0]` to ensure that it's a valid BST.

Another issue is that the min and max values for the left and right subtrees are not being compared correctly.

To fix the bug, we will update the conditions in the `solve` method and fix the comparison of min and max values for left and right subtrees accordingly.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {

    int ans = 0;

    public int maxSumBST(TreeNode root) {
        solve(root);
        return ans;
    }

    // int[] = { min, max, sum, isBST };
    private int[] solve(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return new int[] {Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, 0, 1};

        int[] left = solve(root.left);
        int[] right = solve(root.right);

        if (left[3] == 1 && right[3] == 1 && root.val > left[1] && root.val < right[0]) {
            int sum = left[2] + right[2] + root.val;
            ans = Math.max(ans, sum);
            return new int[] {Math.min(left[0], root.val), Math.max(root.val, right[1]), sum, 1};
        }

        return new int[] {Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, 0, 0};
    }

}
```

In the updated code, we have added an additional parameter `isBST` to the `int[]` returned from the `solve` method, and updated its usage accordingly in the conditions. We have also updated the min and max comparison logic for left and right subtrees. This should fix the bug and correctly determine the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).
