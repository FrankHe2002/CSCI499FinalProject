The code is attempting to find the sum of the values of the deepest leaves in a binary tree. However, the approach seems overly complicated and the calculation of height may not be accurate. 

Starting with the height calculation in the `height` method:
- The `height` method currently returns the maximum height between the left and right subtree, but it is then multiplied by 1, which does not change the result. 
- We should simply return the maximum height between the left and right subtree.

Moving onto the `deepestLeavesSum` method:
- The method initializes `hght` as the height of the root node, which may not be correct.
- The `while` loop iterates over the tree, trying to find the deepest leaves sum. Inside the while loop, it compares `hght` to 1, effectively checking if it has descended to the last level. However, `hght` is decremented in the loop, and the comparison does not properly tally the level.
- The logic to accumulate the sum is also nested and may be causing issues with correct summation.

We will update the `height` method to return the maximum height of a tree/subtree and modify the logic within the `deepestLeavesSum` method to accumulate the sum of the deepest leaves in a simpler and more accurate manner.

Here's the modified code:

```java
// Runtime: 22 ms (Top 8.75%) | Memory: 59.3 MB (Top 36.23%)
class Solution {
    public int height(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        return 1 + Math.max(height(root.left), height(root.right));
    }

    public int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);
        int sum = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode temp = q.poll();
                sum += temp.val;
                if (temp.left != null) q.add(temp.left);
                if (temp.right != null) q.add(temp.right);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In the `height` method, we modified the return statement to properly include the current node in the height calculation.

In the `deepestLeavesSum` method, we calculate the sum of the deepest leaves using level-order/BFS traversal without counting height separately, making the accumulator logic easier and more accurate.

These changes should fix the issues and allow the code to correctly find the sum of values of its deepest leaves.
