The given Java code calculates the minimum number of elements needed to be added to an array to make the sum of the array equal to a given goal, while maintaining the property that the absolute value of each element is less than or equal to the given limit.

The code seems to be logically correct, but there might be a potential bug in the return statement where the calculation for the minimum number of elements to add is being done.

The calculation for the minimum number of elements to add can be incorrect due to integer division and may not return the expected result.

To fix the potential bug, we can use floating point division and then convert the result into an integer. This will ensure that the calculation is accurate and the correct minimum number of elements to add is returned.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minElements(int[] nums, int limit, int goal) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums)
            sum += num;
        long diff = Math.abs(sum - goal);
        return (int) Math.ceil((double) diff / limit); // Using floating point division and then converting to int
    }
}
```
