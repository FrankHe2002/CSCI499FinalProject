Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The given code is trying to count the number of intervals that overlap with the previous one and need to be removed to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. However, the logic inside the for loop has some issues. It is comparing the current interval with the previous one instead of comparing it with the current start and end.

Fix:
Inside the for loop, compare the current interval with the current start and end instead of the previous interval. Update the start and end values accordingly.

Updated code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        int start = intervals[0][0];
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int[] interval = intervals[i];

            if (interval[0] < end) {
                res++;
                end = Math.min(end, interval[1]);
            } else {
                start = interval[0];
                end = interval[1];
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
