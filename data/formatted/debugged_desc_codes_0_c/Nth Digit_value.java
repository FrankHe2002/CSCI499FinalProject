The code goes through a loop to find the nth digit of a given sequence of numbers. The loop appears to be looping through a variety of conditions to calculate the digit. While reviewing the code and its description, the logic appears to be overly complex and unnecessary.

Bug:
1. The logic in the while loop is too complex, making it difficult to understand and prone to error.
2. The `currNumber` variable is being updated in an inconsistent manner, causing the potential for incorrect results.

Fix:
To simplify the code, a new approach can be used to directly calculate the digit without the need for extensive looping and tracking of indices.

Here is the modified code with a simpler approach:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findNthDigit(int n) {
        int digits = 1;
        long base = 9;

        while (n - digits * base > 0) {
            n -= digits * base;
            digits++;
            base *= 10;
        }

        int index = (n - 1) % digits;
        int number = (int) Math.pow(10, digits - 1) + (n - 1) / digits;

        return Character.getNumericValue(String.valueOf(number).charAt(index));
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The new approach simplifies the logic by calculating the digit directly without the need for extensive looping.
2. The number and index of the digit is calculated based on the position n and the length of digits.
3. The number is converted to a string to access the digit at the calculated index.

This revised code provides a simpler and more understandable approach to finding the nth digit without using unnecessary loops.
