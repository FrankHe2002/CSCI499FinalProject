The bug in the given code is that it does not handle the case for n > 10. The problem description specifies that 0 <= n <= 8, so the code should return 0 for any n greater than 8. 

Here's the step-by-step process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The code initializes `ans` to 10, which is correct for n = 1 but doesn't handle the case where n = 0. It should be initialized to 1 for n = 0.
2. The code uses a while loop to compute the count of numbers with unique digits. It multiplies `counter` by `choiceFiller--` and updates `ans` in each iteration. However, it does not handle the case for n > 8.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        int ans = 1; // Initialize to 1 for n = 0
        if (n == 0) {
            return ans;
        }
        ans = 10; // After checking for n = 0, update ans to 10 for n = 1
        if (n == 1) {
            return ans;
        }
        if(n > 8) {
            return 0; // Handle the case for n > 8
        }
        int counter = 9;
        int choiceFiller = 9;
        while (n-- > 1 && choiceFiller > 0) {
            counter *= choiceFiller--;
            ans += counter;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
