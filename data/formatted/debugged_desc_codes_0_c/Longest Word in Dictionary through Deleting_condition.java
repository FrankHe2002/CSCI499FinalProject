Bug type: Logical Error

The logic inside the loops for checking the characters in the dictionary strings is a bit confusing. The `flag` variable is used to prevent overwriting `ans` when a longer word is found. However, this logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the logical error, we can simplify the logic by removing unnecessary assignments and comparisons.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String findLongestWord(String s, List<String> dictionary) {

        String ans = "";
        
        for (String s1 : dictionary) {
            int i = 0;
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                if (i < s1.length() && s1.charAt(i) == c) {
                    i++;
                }
            }
            if (i == s1.length() && (s1.length() > ans.length() || (s1.length() == ans.length() && s1.compareTo(ans) < 0))) {
                ans = s1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

In the revised code, we iterate over each word in the dictionary and check if it can be formed from the string `s`. We use a simple loop to compare characters, and we update `ans` only when we find a word that is longer than the current `ans` or of the same length but lexicographically smaller. This avoids the need for the `flag` variable and complicated comparison statements.

This revised approach should correctly find the longest word that can be formed from the given string and handle the lexicographical comparison as well.
