The bug in this code is in the for loop condition. The condition i >= nums.length - 1 will never be true because i starts at 0 and is supposed to increment by 2 in each iteration. This means the for loop will never run, and the sorting of the array in wave format will not occur.

To fix this issue, the condition in the for loop needs to be changed to i < nums.length - 1.

Here is the corrected code:
```java
// Runtime: 67 ms (Top 33.85%) | Memory: 147.3 MB (Top 73.33%)
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // sort in wave format
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i += 2) {
            int temp = nums[i];
            nums[i] = nums[i + 1];
            nums[i + 1] = temp;
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```
