The current code appears to have a potential bug in the `width()` method. It seems to be adding an extra 2 to the calculation of the width of the rectangle, which might be incorrect.

To fix this, we need to modify the `width()` method to subtract 1 instead of adding 2.

Here is the modified code:

```java
private int width(int[] rect) {
    return rect[2] - rect[0] + 1;
}
```

With this change, the bug in the `width()` method should be fixed.
