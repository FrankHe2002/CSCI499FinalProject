The provided code seems to be trying to find the first repeated character in the input string `s` using a HashSet.

After reviewing the code, it seems that the logic is correct. The code iterates over each character in the input string `s` and adds the character to a HashSet. If the character is already present in the HashSet, it returns the character as the first repeated character. If the iteration completes without finding a repeated character, it returns a space character.

The code seems logically correct, and I don't see any syntax errors.

However, the method signature is incorrect. The code should be using `char` as the return type instead of `void`.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public char repeatedCharacter(String s) {
        HashSet<Character> hset = new HashSet<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (hset.contains(ch)) {
                return ch;
            } else {
                hset.add(ch);
            }
        }
        return ' ';
    }
}
```
I have made the following changes:
- Added the `import java.util.HashSet` statement to import the `HashSet` class.
- Corrected the method signature to `public char repeatedCharacter(String s)` to specify the return type as `char`.
- Added `{}` to the `if` and `else` blocks for better readability, even though the original code didn't have them.

With these changes, the code should work properly in finding the first repeated character in the input string.
