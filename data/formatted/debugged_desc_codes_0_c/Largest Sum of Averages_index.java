Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The check method is supposed to calculate the maximum score for all possible partitions, but the current implementation is incorrect.
2. There isn't a proper base case to handle the condition when the subarray size becomes 0 in the recursive call.

Fix:
I will fix the base case condition in the `check` method to handle cases when the subarray size becomes 0 during the recursive call, and update the return statement to fix the logical error. I will also remove the `System.out.println` statements since they are unnecessary for the functionality of the code.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    Double dp[][][];
    int n;
    int k1;

    public double check(int b, int c, long sum, int n1, int ar[]) {
        if (dp[b][c][n1] != null)
            return dp[b][c][n1];
        if (b == n) {
            if (n1 == 0) {
                return 0.0;
            } else {
                return (double) sum / (double) n1;
            }
        }
        if (c < k1) {
            double choice1 = (double) sum / (double) n1 + check(b, c + 1, 0, 0, ar);
            double choice2 = check(b + 1, c, sum + ar[b], n1 + 1, ar);
            dp[b][c][n1] = Math.max(choice1, choice2);
        } else {
            dp[b][c][n1] = check(b + 1, c, sum + ar[b], n1 + 1, ar);
        }

        return dp[b][c][n1];
    }

    public double largestSumOfAverages(int[] nums, int k) {
        n = nums.length;
        k1 = k - 1;
        dp = new Double[n + 1][k][n + 1];
        return check(0, 0, 0, 0, nums);
    }
}
```
The base case has been updated to handle the condition when the subarray size becomes 0. The return statement in the `check` method has been updated to calculate and compare the maximum score correctly. The `System.out.println` statements have been removed.
