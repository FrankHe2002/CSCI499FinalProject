The provided code calculates the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds by using the square root of n. This solution may be incorrect because the description of the problem implies that the bulbs are toggled, so using the square root of n may not give the correct answer.

To identify the bug type, let's consider possible edge cases and run some test cases to validate the output.

Bug type: Incorrect algorithm logic.

Steps to fix the bug:
1. We need to simulate the toggling process to accurately determine the bulbs that are on after n rounds.
2. The previous implementation using the square root of n does not accurately reflect this process. We will need to implement a solution that iteratively toggles each bulb for n rounds.
3. We can simulate the toggling process using a boolean array to represent the state of each bulb.
4. By iterating through each round and toggling the bulbs at the correct indices, we can determine the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        boolean[] bulbs = new boolean[n];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i - 1; j < n; j += i) {
                bulbs[j] = !bulbs[j];
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (boolean bulb : bulbs) {
            if (bulb) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
