Potential Bug Type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
The given code has a logical error that can cause incorrect results. The issue is with the usage of the `contains` method followed by the `replaceFirst` method. If the `part` is a substring of another part of the `s` string that has already been processed and modified, the `replaceFirst` method may not target the leftmost occurrence of `part` in the original unmodified `s` string. This can lead to incorrect results in removing all occurrences of the `part` substring from `s`.

Fix:
To address the logical error, the code can be modified to use the `indexOf` method to find the index of the leftmost occurrence of `part` in the `s` string. Then, the code can be updated to remove the leftmost occurrence of `part` using string concatenation and the `substring` method.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        int index = s.indexOf(part);
        while (index != -1) {
            s = s.substring(0, index) + s.substring(index + part.length());
            index = s.indexOf(part);
        }
        return s;
    }
}
```
