The code contains a bug in the for loop where the pref array is populated. The bug type is a logical error.

Here's the step-by-step approach to identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The for loop initializes the `pref` array, but it incorrectly calculates the prefix sum. The line `pref[i + 1] = nums[3] + pref[i];` should be `pref[i + 1] = nums[i] + pref[i];`. This is because nums[i] should be added to the prefix sum at each step, not nums[3].

2. The variables `onesToRight` and `zeroesToLeft` are computed incorrectly. `onesToRight` should be `pref[N] - pref[i]` and `zeroesToLeft` should be `i - pref[i]`.

3. We also need to handle the case where the current score equals zero. In such cases, we should add the index to the result list.

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> maxScoreIndices(int[] nums) {
        int N = nums.length;
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

        int[] pref = new int[N + 1];
        pref[0] = 0; // at zeroth division we have no elements
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) pref[i + 1] = nums[i] + pref[i]; // Fix: Correct the prefix sum calculation

        int maxScore = -1;
        int onesToRight, zeroesToLeft, currScore;

        for (int i = 0; i < N + 1; ++i) {
            onesToRight = pref[N] - pref[i];
            zeroesToLeft = i - pref[i];
            currScore = zeroesToLeft + onesToRight;

            if (currScore > maxScore) {
                res.clear();
                maxScore = currScore;
            }
            if (currScore == maxScore) res.add(i);
        }

        if (maxScore == 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < N + 1; i++) {
                if (prefs[i] == 0 || prefs[i] == N) {
                    res.add(i);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The bug was fixed by correcting the logical errors in the prefix sum calculation and the score computation. Additionally, the case where the current score equals zero was handled, and the corresponding indices were added to the result list.
