The given Java code seems to have a bug. The bug in the code is that the current implementation only checks if the given string is a palindrome or not and returns 2 if it is not and returns 1 if it is.

The expected behavior of the code should remove the palindromic subsequences from the string and return the number of steps required to make the given string empty.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation to check for 'a' and 'b' characters separately. Since the string only consists of letters 'a' and 'b', here are the steps to identify and fix the bug:

1. Check if the input string is empty, return 0 if it is empty.
2. Check if the input string is already a palindrome (contains only 'a's or only 'b's), return 1 if it is.
3. Return 2 otherwise, as both 'a' and 'b' can be removed in separate steps.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        } else if (isPalindrome(s)) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 2;
        }
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
