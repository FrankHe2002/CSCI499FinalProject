The original implementation attempts to find the nth magical number using binary search. The formula for finding the magical number seems to be incorrect. There are also some logical issues here and there which will lead to incorrect results. Here are the bugs and issues within the code:

1. The main issue occurs in the calculation of `mid` and the calculation of `x`. 
2. The while loop condition should be `low < high` rather than `low <= high`.
3. The calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) in the `lcm` function seems flawed.
4. The condition order in the while loop seems to be reversed.
5. The calculation of x is wrong.
6. The logic inside the while loop is not correctly implemented.

To fix these issues, a refactored version of the code is given below.

```java
class Solution {
    public int nthMagicalNumber(int n, int a, int b) {
        long mod = 1000000007;
        long lcm = lcm(a, b);
        long low = 0;
        long high = (long) n * Math.max(a, b);

        while (low < high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long x = mid / a + mid / b - mid / lcm;

            if (x >= n) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return (int) (low % mod);
    }

    long lcm(long a, long b) {
        return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
    }

    long gcd(long a, long b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            long temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

This refactored code calculates the nth magical number correctly using the binary search. Also, the LCM and GCD functions are refactored and corrected. This should fix the issues and produce the correct results.
