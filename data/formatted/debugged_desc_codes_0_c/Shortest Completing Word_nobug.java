The code seems to have an incorrect logic while finding the shortest completing word. It also appears to have extra logic to handle edge cases that may not be necessary.

Here are the steps followed to identify and correct the bug:

1. **License Plate Character Count**: The code correctly allocates an array of size 26 to store the count of letters in the `licensePlate` string. However, it uses an ArrayList to store the words meeting the criteria which is not necessary because the problem asks for the shortest completing word.

2. **Add Char Count for Each Char in LicensePlate**: The code loops through each character of the `licensePlate` and fills the corresponding count in the `licensePlateCount` array. The isChar method seems to check if the character is an alphabet or not, but it can be simplified and integrated within the loop.

3. **Add Char Count for Each Word in Words**: The code loops through each word in the `words` and fills the corresponding count of letters in the `wordCharCount` array. Then it checks if the word satisfies the criteria or not. An unnecessary boolean flag indication is used.

4. **Finding Min Word Length and Returning the Result**: After adding the words satisfying the criteria to the list, it iterates over the list to find the word with the minimum length. The current implementation suggests to return `-1` if no word is found, but it is not required as it is guaranteed that an answer exists.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String shortestCompletingWord(String licensePlate, String[] words) {
        int[] licensePlateCount = new int[26];
        for (char c : licensePlate.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
                licensePlateCount[Character.toLowerCase(c) - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        
        String result = null;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (String word : words) {
            int[] wordCharCount = new int[26];
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                wordCharCount[Character.toLowerCase(c) - 'a']++;
            }

            boolean isCompletingWord = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (licensePlateCount[i] > wordCharCount[i]) {
                    isCompletingWord = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (isCompletingWord && word.length() < minLength) {
                result = word;
                minLength = word.length();
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

The changes made to the existing code include the removal of unnecessary boolean flag, the list to store results replaced with a single result variable, and the simplification of the character checking logic.
