The bug in the code is that the initial value of prev is assigned as 0, which may not be a valid initial value since the given input constraints specify that each number in the string is a positive number less than 100, with no leading zeros. Thus, a value of 0 for prev may cause incorrect results when comparing with the first number in the string.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize prev with a value that ensures it will be less than any valid number present in the input string.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areNumbersAscending(String s) {
        int prev = -1; // Initialize prev with a value less than any valid number in the input string

        for (String token : s.split(" ")) {
            try {
                int number = Integer.parseInt(token);
                if (number <= prev) // Change the condition to check for non-strictly increasing
                    return false;
                prev = number;
            } catch (Exception e) {
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
In the corrected code, the prev variable is initialized with a value of -1 to ensure that it is less than any valid number in the input string. Additionally, the condition for comparing the numbers has been changed to <= to check for non-strictly increasing.
