The bug in the provided code is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. It is being caused by initializing the `dp` array with the size of `m - 1` instead of `m + 1`.

To identify the bug, I first see that the code is creating a 2D array `dp` of size `m - 1` by `n + 1`. Then, inside the nested for loops, it is accessing `dp` using indices `i` and `j`. After identifying the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, I checked the array initialization statement and found that it's initializing the `dp` array with the incorrect size.

To fix the bug, I will change the initialization of the `dp` array to use the correct sizes, `m + 1` by `n + 1`.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxUncrossedLines(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int m = nums1.length;
        int n = nums2.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
