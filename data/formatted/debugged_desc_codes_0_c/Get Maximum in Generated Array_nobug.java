The code initializes an array `nums` of length `n + 1`, where the numbers are calculated according to the given conditions. The maximum integer in the array is returned.

I don't see any syntax errors, so the bug type here is a logical error.

The logical error in the code appears to arise from the for loop where the array `nums` is being populated. The problem is in the conditions for assigning values to `nums[i]` in the else part of the loop. The conditions `2 <= 2 * i` and `2 <= 2 * i + 1` are incorrect. So, we need to change the conditions for populating the odd indices in the `nums` array.

Below is the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMaximumGenerated(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return n;
        }

        int nums[] = new int[n + 1];

        nums[0] = 0;
        nums[1] = 1;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                nums[i] = nums[i / 2];
            } else {
                nums[i] = nums[i / 2] + nums[i / 2 + 1];
            }
            max = Math.max(max, nums[i]);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
