There are a few bugs in the given code. 

1. The condition `coins.length == 0 && coins == null` should be `coins.length == 0 || coins == null` to check if the array is empty or null.
2. There is a missing semicolon at `TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>()`.
3. The logic to calculate the maximum consecutive integer values is incorrect. It should not be based on the sum of individual coins.

Here's the updated code with the bugs fixed:

```java
import java.util.TreeMap;

class Solution {
    public int getMaximumConsecutive(int[] coins) {
        if (coins == null || coins.length == 0)
            return 1;
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int i : coins)
            map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        int range = 0;
        for (int i : map.keySet()) {
            if (range + 1 >= i)
                range += map.get(i);
            else
                break;
        }
        return range + 1;
    }
}
```
In this fixed code:
1. The if condition `coins.length == 0 && coins == null` has been updated to `coins == null || coins.length == 0`.
2. The missing semicolon at `TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>()` has been added.
3. The logic to calculate the maximum consecutive integer values has been updated to consider the frequency of coins rather than simply summing their values. This is reflected in the updated loop for `map.keySet()`.
