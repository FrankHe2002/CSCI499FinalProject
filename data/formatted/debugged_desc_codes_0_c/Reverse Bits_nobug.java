The bug in the provided code is that the variable `j` is not reset to 0 after every iteration of the for loop. This leads to incorrect bit reversal because the 'smask' becomes a left shift of `j` in every iteration, causing the bits to be reversed incorrectly.

To fix this bug, I will reset the value of `j` to 0 at the end of each iteration of the for loop.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int mask = 0;
        int smask = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int rev = 0;

        // basically we are checking that the number is set bit or not 
        // if the number is set bit then we are appending that to our main answer i.e, rev
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            mask = 1 << i;
            if ((mask & n) != 0) {
                smask = 1 << j;
                rev = rev | smask;
            }
            j++;
            // reset j to 0
            if (i > 0) {
                smask = 0;
            }
        }

        // Time Complexity : O(32 for int)
        // Space Complexity : O(1)
        return rev;
    }
}
```
