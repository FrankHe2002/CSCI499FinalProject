The code appears to have the potential bug. Upon examining the code, specifically the for loop, it seems that the loop will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because it is attempting to access students[i + 1] when i is already at its maximum value on the last iteration, which will result in an index out of bounds error.

To address this bug, I will adjust the loop condition to stop at seats.length - 1. In addition, for the calculation of the minimum number of moves, I will consider the absolute difference between the current seat and student position, which will require minimal changes.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        Arrays.sort(seats);
        Arrays.sort(students);
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
            diff += Math.abs(students[i] - seats[i]);
        }
        return diff;
    }
}
```
