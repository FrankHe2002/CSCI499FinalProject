The given code seems to be logically correct. It uses a HashMap to store the last index of each card value and then calculates the minimum difference between the indices to find the minimum number of consecutive cards needed to have a pair of matching cards.

However, there seems to be a potential bug in the code. When calculating the minimum difference between indices, the formula used is `i - map.get(cards[i]) + 1`. This formula seems to add 1 unnecessarily, which might lead to incorrect results.

To fix the issue, I will modify the formula to be `i - map.get(cards[i])` to ensure that we are calculating the correct difference in indices.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumCardPickup(int[] cards) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(cards[i]))
                min = Math.min(i - map.get(cards[i]), min); // Check if the difference in indices is smaller than minimum
            map.put(cards[i], i); // Update the last found index of the card
        }
        return min == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : min; // Repetition found or not
    }
}
```

With this fix, the code should now correctly calculate the minimum number of consecutive cards needed to have a pair of matching cards.
