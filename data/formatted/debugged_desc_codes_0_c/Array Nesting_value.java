Bug type:
1. Logical Error: The for loop in the `arrayNesting` method starts with `i = -1` instead of `i = 0`. This will result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. Off-by-one error: The condition `! visited[i]` should start from `i = 0` instead of `i = -1` in the `arrayNesting` method. 

3. The dfs method does not consider the base case when the `visited[i]` is true, it should return 1 instead of 0.

4. The arrayNesting method should have the condition `if(nums[i] != i)` inside the for loop to skip the already visited elements and for efficiency


Reasoning:
The code should be reviewed step by step to ensure it meets the conditions for calculating the set s[k].

Identifying the Bugs:
1. The logical error can be identified by observing that the loop starts from -1, and the array `nums` only accepts values from 0 to n-1. So, it will throw an index out of bounds exception.

2. The off-by-one error can be identified by comparing the loop starting point `i=-1` with the condition `! visited[i]`, which should start from 0 and also from the array type. And the starting point should not be -1.

3. The dfs method's logical error can be identified by thinking through the base case when `visited[i]` is true, the function should return 1 instead of 0.

4. The Efficiency error can be identified by thinking it through that we should skip the already visited elements and that's missing from the code.

Fixing the Bugs:
```java
class Solution {
    public int arrayNesting(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                int len = dfs(nums, i, visited);
                res = Math.max(res, len);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    public int dfs(int[] nums, int i, boolean[] visited) {
        if (visited[i]) return 1;
        visited[i] = true;
        return 1 + dfs(nums, nums[i], visited);
    }
}
```
