The bug in the given code is that the closing parenthesis is not being added at the end of the string.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The function `optimalDivision` takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns a string representing the expression with the maximum value after evaluation.
2. It first checks for the lengths of the array and handles the cases where the length is 1 or 2 by directly returning the expression in string format.
3. For arrays with length more than 2, it uses a `StringBuilder` to construct the expression in the required format.
4. After adding the numerator and the opening parenthesis, it iterates from the 2nd element to the 2nd last element of the array, adding each element and the division sign to the `StringBuilder`.
5. The final element is then added along with a closing parenthesis.

The issue in the code is that there is a syntax error in the for loop. The closing parenthesis is missing after the loop, and there is an extra closing parenthesis at the end.

The correct code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public String optimalDivision(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return Integer.toString(nums[0]);
        } else if (nums.length == 2) {
            return nums[0] + "/" + nums[1];
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append(nums[0]).append("/(").append(nums[1]);
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sb.append("/").append(nums[i]);
        }
        sb.append(")");

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

The code inside the for loop is corrected to add each element and the division sign to the `StringBuilder` and the missing closing parenthesis is added at the end. Additionally, `Integer.toString()` is used instead of concatenating the number with an empty string to handle the case of a single element array.
