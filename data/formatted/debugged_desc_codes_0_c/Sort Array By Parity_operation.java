Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code aims to move all the even integers to the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.
2. The while loop iterates through the array, but the condition check inside the loop is faulty.
3. The condition `if (nums[i] * 2 == 1)` checks if the current number multiplied by 2 is equal to 1, which is incorrect. This condition will only be true for odd numbers.
4. Instead, we should check if the number is odd or even.

To fix the issue:
1. Change the condition inside the while loop to check for even or odd numbers using the modulus operator (%).
2. If `nums[i] % 2 == 0`, swap the elements and increment both i and j. Otherwise, only increment i.
3. Remove the multiplication condition which is causing the issue.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 48.1 MB (Top 66.96%)
class Solution {

    public int[] sortArrayByParity(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while (i < nums.length) {
            if (nums[i] % 2 == 0) {
                int temp = nums[i];
                nums[i] = nums[j];
                nums[j] = temp;

                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }

        return nums;
    }
}
```
