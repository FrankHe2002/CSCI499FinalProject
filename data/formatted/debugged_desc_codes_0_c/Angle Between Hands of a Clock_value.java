There is a bug in the code. The bug is in the line `return Math.min(units, 0 - units) * 6;`. The intention here is to return the smaller angle between the minute and hour hand, but the calculation for that is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we can calculate the angle formed by the minute and hour hands correctly and return the smaller angle.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        // Position of hour hand in a circle of 0 - 59
        double hrPos = 30 * (hour % 12) + 0.5 * minutes;

        // Position of minute hand in a circle of 0 - 59
        double minPos = 6 * minutes;

        // Calculate the angle formed by the hour and minute hands
        double angle = Math.abs(hrPos - minPos);
        
        // Return the smaller angle
        return Math.min(angle, 360 - angle);
    }
}
```
