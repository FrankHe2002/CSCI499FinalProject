The given code calculates whether the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions in the array nums. The current implementation is checking if the absolute difference between the value at index i and i itself is greater than 1 for any element in the array. If it is, then it returns false, else it returns true.

The bug in the code is that it is only checking if the absolute difference between the value at index i and i is greater than 1, but it is not correctly checking for global inversions and local inversions separately. The current implementation only calculates if the local inversions are present or not, it is not taking into account the global inversions.

To fix the bug, we need to calculate both the number of local inversions and global inversions separately. Then we will compare both values and return the result accordingly.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isIdealPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int localInversions = 0;
        int globalInversions = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
                localInversions++;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (Math.abs(nums[i] - i) > 1) {
                globalInversions++;
            }
        }

        return localInversions == globalInversions;
    }
}
```
