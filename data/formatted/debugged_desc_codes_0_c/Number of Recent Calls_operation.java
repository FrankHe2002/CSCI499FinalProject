The issue with the provided code is that for each ping call, it iterates through all the previous calls to count the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) for each ping call, where n is the number of previous calls, which is not efficient.

To fix this issue, we can optimize the code to have a time complexity of O(1) for each ping call by using a Queue to store the calls within the last 3000 milliseconds. We can then use the size of the Queue to determine the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds.

Here's the updated code with the fix implemented:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class RecentCounter {
    Queue<Integer> calls;

    public RecentCounter() {
        calls = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public int ping(int t) {
        calls.add(t);
        while (calls.peek() < t - 3000) {
            calls.poll();
        }
        return calls.size();
    }
}
/**
 / Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RecentCounter obj = new RecentCounter();
 * int param_1 = obj.ping(t);
 */
```

In this fix, we changed the ArrayList to a Queue and modified the ping method to remove the calls that are older than 3000 milliseconds using a while loop, and then return the size of the Queue as the count of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds. This approach ensures that the time complexity of each ping call is O(1), making the code more efficient.
