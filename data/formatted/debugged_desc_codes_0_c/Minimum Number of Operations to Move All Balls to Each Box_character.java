The bug in the given code is that it is not taking into account the adjacent boxes. The code is calculating the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the ith box without considering the adjacent boxes. 

To fix this, we need to iterate over the string and keep track of the positions of the boxes containing balls. Then, for each box, we can calculate the minimum number of operations needed by summing up the distances to the adjacent boxes. 

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length();
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int t = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (boxes.charAt(j) == '1') {
                    t += Math.abs(i - j);
                }
            }
            ans[i] = t;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
