The given code intends to reformat a phone number in a specific manner by removing spaces and dashes and then grouping the digits into blocks of a certain length. However, there is a logical bug in the `reformatNumber` method.

Let's analyze the code and identify the bug step by step:
1. The code starts by removing spaces and dashes from the input `number`.
2. Then, it calculates the length of the modified number and checks its length.
3. If the length is less than or equal to 3, it returns the modified number as is.
4. If the length is 4, it returns a substring of the modified number with a dash added in the middle.
5. If the length is greater than 4, the code tries to add a dash after the first 3 characters and then recursively calls the `reformatNumber` method.

The issue with the code is in the recursive call to `reformatNumber`. The recursive invocation is modifying the substring starting from the index 2, which is causing incorrect formatting of the phone number.

We can fix this issue by adjusting the substring indices and the final formatting logic.

Below is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    String modifiedNumber = "";

    public String reformatNumber(String number) {
        modifiedNumber = number.replace(" ", "").replace("-", "");
        int l = modifiedNumber.length();
        
        if (l <= 3) {
            return modifiedNumber;
        } else if (l == 4) {
            return modifiedNumber.substring(0, 2) + "-" + modifiedNumber.substring(2, 4);
        } else {
            if (l == 5) {
                return modifiedNumber.substring(0, 3) + "-" + modifiedNumber.substring(3, 5);
            }
            modifiedNumber = modifiedNumber.substring(0, 3) + "-" + reformatNumber(modifiedNumber.substring(3));
        }
        return modifiedNumber;
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, we have modified the condition for when the length is equal to 5 to ensure correct formatting. We also adjusted the recursive call to `reformatNumber` to start the substring from index 3, allowing for correct grouping of digits.
