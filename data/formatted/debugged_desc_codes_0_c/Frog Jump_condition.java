The code looks like it's attempting to use recursion to determine whether the frog can cross the river using the provided stones. The bug in the code is that the "flag" variable is not being re-initialized within the `canBeCrossed` method, resulting in unexpected behavior.

Additionally, there is no need to use a static variable for "flag." It can be passed as a parameter to the recursive method.

To address this, I will:
1. Remove the static "flag" variable and initialize it within the `canBeCrossed` method.
2. Change the return type of `canBeCrossed` to void and use a boolean variable to keep track of whether the frog can cross the river. This is done to prevent the method from always returning true when using recursion.

Here's the updated code with the identified fixes:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canCross(int[] stones) {
        return canBeCrossed(stones, 0, 0, new boolean[stones.length][stones.length]);
    }

    public boolean canBeCrossed(int[] stones, int currentPosition, int jumpSize, boolean[][] visited) {
        if (currentPosition == stones.length - 1) { 
            return true;
        }
        
        if (visited[currentPosition][jumpSize]) {
            return false; // If already checked for current position and jumpSize
        }
        
        for (int i = currentPosition + 1; i < stones.length; i++) {
            int gap = stones[i] - stones[currentPosition];
            if (gap >= jumpSize - 1 && gap <= jumpSize + 1) {
                if (canBeCrossed(stones, i, gap, visited)) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else if (gap > jumpSize + 1) {
                break;
            }
        }

        visited[currentPosition][jumpSize] = true;
        return false;
    }
}
```
