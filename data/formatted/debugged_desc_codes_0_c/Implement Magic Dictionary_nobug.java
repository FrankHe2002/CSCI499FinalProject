The code looks mostly good, and the `match` method is correctly implemented to check if two strings differ by exactly one character. However, there is a potential bug in the `search` method. 

The bug is identified through the following steps:
1. When `searchWord` length does not match `dictWord` length, the `match` method is never called, causing false negatives.
2. We should return true if there is a string in the dictionary that has the same length as `searchWord`, and differing by exactly one character.

To fix this bug, we should check the length of each word in the dictionary against the length of the `searchWord`, and if they match, then call the `match` method. If the `match` method returns true for any word in the dictionary, the search method should return true.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class MagicDictionary {
    private String[] dictionary;

    public MagicDictionary() {
    }

    public void buildDict(String[] dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = dictionary;
    }

    public boolean search(String searchWord) {
        for (String dictWord : this.dictionary) {
            if (dictWord.length() == searchWord.length() && this.match(searchWord, dictWord, 1))
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    private boolean match(String s, String t, int expectedDiff) {
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != t.charAt(i))
                diff++;
            if (diff > expectedDiff)
                return false;
        }

        return diff == expectedDiff;
    }
}
```
