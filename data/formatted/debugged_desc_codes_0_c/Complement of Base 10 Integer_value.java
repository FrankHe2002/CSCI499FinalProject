The code provided calculates the bitwise complement of an integer by converting the integer to its binary representation, then flipping the bits to get the complement, and finally converting the complement back to an integer.

The potential bug in the code is that it may not handle leading zeros in the binary representation of the input integer correctly when calculating the complement.

To fix this bug:
1. We should find the length of the binary representation of the input integer and create a mask of "1"s of the same length.
2. We then use bitwise XOR to calculate the complement of the input integer.

Here's the modified code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        int mask = (Integer.highestOneBit(n) << 1) - 1;
        
        return n ^ mask;
    }
}
```
