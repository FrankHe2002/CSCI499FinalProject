Bug type:
Logical error/incorrect output

Reasoning:
The code is supposed to return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n. The algorithm used for solving the problem is based on dynamic programming and recursion. The issue with the current code is that it does not handle the base cases and constraints correctly, which results in incorrect outputs. A possible change to address this issue is to update the base case and constraint handling in the helper function.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {
    public int numSquares(int n) {

        ArrayList<Integer> perfect_squares = new ArrayList<>();
        int i = 1;
        while (i * i <= n) {
            perfect_squares.add(i * i);
            i++;
        }
        Integer[][] dp = new Integer[n + 1][perfect_squares.size() + 1];
        int answer = helper(n, perfect_squares, perfect_squares.size() - 1, dp);
        return answer;
    }

    public int helper(int n, ArrayList<Integer> coins, int i, Integer[][] dp) {

        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (i < 0) {
            return 999999; // Take a number greater than the constraint (10^4)
        }
        if (dp[n][i] != null) {
            return dp[n][i];
        }
        int nottake = helper(n, coins, i - 1, dp); // Remove the 0 +
        int take = 9999999;
        if (coins.get(i) <= n) {
            take = 1 + helper(n - coins.get(i), coins, i, dp);
        }
        dp[n][i] = Math.min(nottake, take);
        return dp[n][i];
    }
}
```
Changes Made:
1. Updated the while loop in the numSquares function to start from 1.
2. Removed the unnecessary addition in the nottake variable.
3. Adjusted the base case to return `999999` as a number greater than the constraint for `n` when `i < 0`.
4. Modified the take calculation to be `1 + helper(n - coins.get(i), coins, i, dp)`.
5. Removed the additional `return 0;` and `return 9999999;` statements as they are not required.
