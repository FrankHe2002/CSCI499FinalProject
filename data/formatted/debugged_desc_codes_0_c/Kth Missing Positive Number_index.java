There are a couple of issues with the given code:

1. In the for loop condition, `i` starts with 0 but it should start with 1 to avoid index out of bounds error.
2. The logic inside the for loop is incorrect. It's incrementing `k` for every iterative loop, which is not the correct approach to find the `k`th missing number from the array.

To fix the issues, the following changes need to be made to the code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr[0] > k) {
            return k;  // Return k if it's less than the first element of the array
        }

        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] - mid - 1 < k) {  // Check if the missing numbers before arr[mid] is less than k
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return low + k;  // Return the kth missing number
    }
}
```

In the updated code, we're using a binary search algorithm to find the kth missing number, which ensures less than O(n) complexity.

The code is now corrected and should work as expected.
