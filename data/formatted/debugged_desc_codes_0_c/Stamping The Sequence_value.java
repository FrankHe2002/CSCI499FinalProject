Bug type:
Logical error

Fix:
The issue here is that the code is not properly setting the indices of the result array when the stack is being popped. The initial value of `i` should be 0, and the array should be populated from the beginning rather than the end. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
int i = 0;
int[] result = new int[stack.size()];
while (!stack.empty()) {
    result[i++] = stack.pop();
}
```
With this change, the code should work as expected.
