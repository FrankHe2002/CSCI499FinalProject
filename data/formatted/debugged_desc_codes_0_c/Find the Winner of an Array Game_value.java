Bug type: Logical error

There is a logical error in the given code. The count is reset to 2 instead of 1 when the winner changes, which does not correctly count the consecutive wins.

To fix the bug, we need to increment the count by 1 when the winner changes instead of setting it to 2.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getWinner(int[] arr, int k) {

        int winner = arr[0];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (winner > arr[i])
                count++;
            else {
                winner = arr[i];
                count = 1; // Increment count by 1 when winner changes
            }
            if (count == k)
                return winner;
        }
        return winner;
    }
}
```
