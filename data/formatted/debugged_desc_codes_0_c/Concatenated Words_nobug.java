The given Java code is for finding all the concatenated words in the list of words. The code is using backtracking to check if a word is a concatenated word by checking if it is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array. 

Bug:
The bug in the code is that the initial value of `index` is not reset after backtracking. This causes the 'index' to retain its value over multiple calls to the `backtrack` function.

Approach:
1. Iterate through the given code and see what each variable/function is doing.
2. Identify that the issue is due to not resetting the 'index' value after the recursive calls to the `backtrack` function.

To fix the bug:
1. Reset the value of 'index' at the end of the `backtrack` function by assigning the 'indexCopy' value back to 'index'.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
    Set<String> res = new HashSet<>();
    int index = 0;

    public List<String> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(String[] words) {
        for (String word : words) set.add(word);
        for (String word : words) {
            int len = word.length();
            index = 0;
            backtrack(len, word, 0);
        }
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String word : res) list.add(word);
        return list;
    }

    public void backtrack(int len, String word, int num) {
        if (index == len && num >= 2) {
            res.add(word);
        }
        int indexCopy = index;
        for (int i = index + 1; i <= len; i++) {
            if (set.contains(word.substring(index, i))) {
                index = i;
                backtrack(len, word, num + 1);
                index = indexCopy;  // Reset the value of 'index'
            }
        }
        return;
    }
}
```
