The code appears to be using dynamic programming to store the number of binary trees that can be formed based on each value in the input array. It then calculates the total number of binary trees by summing up the results for each value and returning the final result modulo 10^9 + 7.

Upon reviewing the code, I don't see any obvious syntax errors, but I suspect there might be an issue with the solve method, which is meant to calculate the number of binary trees that can be formed using a given value as the root of the tree.

The bug in the code is that the solve method doesn't handle the base case where the value of 'val' is less than or equal to 1. Since the problem statement specifically mentions that each integer arr[i] is strictly greater than 1, we need to handle the case explicitly.

I will fix this bug by adding a base case check at the beginning of the solve method to return 0 if the value is less than or equal to 1.

Here's the updated code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    int mod = 1000000007;
    HashMap<Integer, Long> dp;
    HashSet<Integer> set;

    public int numFactoredBinaryTrees(int[] arr) {
        long ans = 0;
        dp = new HashMap<>();
        set = new HashSet<>();

        for (int val : arr) set.add(val);

        for (int val : arr) {
            //giving each unique value a chance to be root node of the tree
            ans += solve(val, arr);
            ans %= mod;
        }

        return (int) ans;
    }

    public long solve(int val, int[] nums) {

        if (val <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (dp.containsKey(val)) {
            return dp.get(val);
        }

        long ans = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (val % nums[i] == 0 && set.contains(val / nums[i])) {
                long left = solve(nums[i], nums);
                long right = solve(val / nums[i], nums);

                ans += ((left * right) % mod);
                ans %= mod;
            }
        }

        dp.put(val, ans);

        return ans;
    }
}
```

After adding the base case check in the solve method, the code should now correctly handle the case where the input array contains a value less than or equal to 1.
