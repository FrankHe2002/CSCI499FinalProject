Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code seems to be trying to find and count the frequency of each character in the string using a HashMap.
2. It then counts the even occurrences of each character and adds them to find the final length of the longest palindrome.

Identifying and Fixing the Bug:
1. The logic for counting the odd and even occurrences of characters seems flawed. We need to consider the fact that if a character occurs an odd number of times, we can still use it to form a palindrome, but only the even occurrences contribute to the length of the palindrome.
2. The logic for counting odd and even occurrences of characters needs to be corrected.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        int evenNo = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (int val : map.values()) {
            evenNo += (val / 2) * 2;
        }

        if (evenNo < s.length()) {
            evenNo += 1;
        }
        return evenNo;
    }
}
```
