Bug type: Logical error

There is a logical error in the while loop condition inside the for loop. The condition `arr[j] != arr[1]` should be `arr[j] != arr[i]`.

Also, there is a more concise and cleaner way to implement the logic using a for loop with an if-else condition.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String longestPrefix(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        char arr[] = s.toCharArray();
        int lps[] = new int[n];
        int j = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(arr[i] == arr[j]) {
                lps[i] = ++j;
            } else if(j > 0) {
                j = lps[j - 1];
                i--;
            }
        }
        return s.substring(0, j);
    }
}
```

The fixed code addresses the logical error and provides an alternative method to solve the problem in a more concise way by looping through the string and updating the lps array based on the prefix and suffix comparison.
