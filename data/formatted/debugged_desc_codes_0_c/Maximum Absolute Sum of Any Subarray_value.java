The given code is intended to find the maximum absolute sum of any subarray in the given integer array `nums`. 

The code iterates through each element in the array and tracks the current minimum and maximum sum of subarrays.

Upon review, one issue with the code is that the initialization of `currentMinSum` and `currentMaxSum` is incorrect. Since the array `nums` can contain negative numbers, initializing `currentMinSum` with `-1` and `currentMaxSum` with `0` will produce incorrect results. 

The variable `currentMinSum` should be initialized with `0` and `currentMaxSum` should be initialized with `nums[0]` to handle subarrays with negative numbers.

Additionally, the if conditions for updating `currentMinSum` and `currentMaxSum` need to be modified.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAbsoluteSum(int[] nums) {
        int minSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE, maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE, currentMinSum = 0, currentMaxSum = nums[0];
        for (int num : nums) {
            currentMaxSum = Math.max(num, currentMaxSum + num);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentMaxSum);

            currentMinSum = Math.min(num, currentMinSum + num);
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentMinSum);
        }
        return Math.max(maxSum, -minSum);
    }
}
```

Changes made:
1. Initialized `currentMinSum` with `0` and `currentMaxSum` with `nums[0]`.
2. Modified the logic for updating `currentMinSum` and `currentMaxSum` within the loop.
3. Adjusted the calculation for `maxSum` and `minSum` returned at the end.
