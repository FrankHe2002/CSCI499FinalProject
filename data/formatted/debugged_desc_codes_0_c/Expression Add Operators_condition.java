There appears to be a bug in the implementation of the `operator` method. The bug might be related to the calculation of the `mid` variable, and the conditions for the `prev` variable.

The first issue to address is the calculation of the `mid` variable. It is not initialized, and it seems to be accumulating the value of the operands in a way that is not intended by the logic of the algorithm.

Another issue is related to the `prev` variable and its conditions. The conditions for the `prev` variable do not seem to be consistent with the logic in the algorithm, especially the check between -1 and 1.

Lastly, the conditions for performing multiplication with a negative or positive value need to be further examined.

Let's fix these issues:

```java
class Solution {
    String s;
    List<String> result;
    int target;

    public void operator(int i, long prev, long prod, long sum, String exp, List<Long> l) {
        if (i == l.size()) {
            if (sum + prod == target)
                result.add(exp);
            return;
        }
        for (int j = i; j < l.size(); j++) {
            long curr = Long.parseLong(s.substring(i, j + 1));
            if (i == 0) {
                operator(j + 1, curr, curr, curr, exp + curr, l);
            } else {
                operator(j + 1, curr, prod * curr, sum + prod, exp + "*" + curr, l);
                operator(j + 1, -curr, -curr, sum - curr, exp + "-" + curr, l);
                operator(j + 1, curr, curr, sum + curr, exp + "+" + curr, l);
            }
            if (curr == 0) break;
        }
    }

    public void rec(int in, List<Long> l) {
        if (in == s.length()) {
            operator(1, l.get(0), l.get(0), l.get(0), l.get(0) + "", l);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = in; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (i != in && s.charAt(in) == '0') break;
            long curr = Long.parseLong(s.substring(in, i + 1));
            l.add(curr);
            rec(i + 1, l);
            l.remove(l.size() - 1);
        }
    }

    public List<String> addOperators(String num, int target) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        this.s = num;
        this.target = target;
        rec(0, new ArrayList<>(30));
        return result;
    }
}
```

The following changes were made:
1. Removed the concept of `prev` and refactored the `operator` method to handle the accumulation of the sum.
2. Removed the conditions for `prev` and restructured the logic within the `operator` method.
3. Modified the `rec` method to address the issue of parsing numbers with leading zeroes.
4. Implemented appropriate break conditions for the zero case to avoid unnecessary iterations.
