Bug type: Logical Error

The bug in the code appears to be a logical error in the solve() method, where the count of obstacles is not properly updated when moving to a new cell. It should be updated as cnt + grid[newI][newJ] instead of just cnt.

Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the isValid() method as well. The condition in the method seems to be incorrect as Math.min(i, j) should not be used for checking if i and j are both greater than or equal to 0.

The solve() method should consider obstacles and count them properly, and the isValid() method should be updated to appropriately check the boundaries of the grid.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    int[][] grid;
    int n, m;
    boolean[][] seen;
    int[] dx = new int[] {0, 0, 1, -1};
    int[] dy = new int[] {1, -1, 0, 0};
    int[][] dp;
    int finalres;

    private boolean isValid(int i, int j) {
        return i >= 0 && j >= 0 && i < n && j < m && !seen[i][j];
    }

    private int solve(int i, int j, int cnt) {
        if (cnt >= finalres) return finalres;
        if (i == n - 1 && j == m - 1) {
            return cnt;
        }
        if (dp[i][j] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) return dp[i][j];
        int res = n * m + 1;
        seen[i][j] = true;
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
            int newI = i + dx[k], newJ = j + dy[k];
            if (isValid(newI, newJ)) {
                res = Math.min(res, solve(newI, newJ, cnt + grid[newI][newJ])); // count obstacles properly
            }
        }
        seen[i][j] = false;
        return dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], res);
    }

    public int minimumObstacles(int[][] grid) {
        this.grid = grid;
        this.n = grid.length;
        this.m = grid[0].length;
        this.seen = new boolean[n][m];
        dp = new int[n][m];
        finalres = n * m + 1;
        for (int[] row : dp) Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        return solve(0, 0, 0);
    }
}
