After reviewing the given Java code, it appears that the potential bug is present in the arrayCeiling method. The issue seems to be that the arrayCeiling method does not use the correct logic to find the smallest element greater than or equal to the given value (`val`).

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the arrayCeiling method to ensure that it correctly finds the smallest element greater than or equal to the given value.

Here's the revised code with the updated arrayCeiling method:

```java
    // Smallest element greater than or equal to val
    private int arrayCeiling(int[] arr, int val) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr.length - 1;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] >= val) {
                min = arr[mid];
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // Return min if it is still the default value, indicating no valid element was found
        return min == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : min;
    }
```

The problem was that the original arrayCeiling method didn't handle cases where no valid element was found, which could lead to incorrect results. The fix includes updating the method to return `Integer.MAX_VALUE` if no valid element is found, ensuring that the method always returns a valid result.

After making this change, the arrayCeiling method should now work correctly and achieve the intended behavior.
