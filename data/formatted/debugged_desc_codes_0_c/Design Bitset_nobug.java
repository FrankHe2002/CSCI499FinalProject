Bug type: Logical Error

The code seems to be mostly correct, but there are a few potential logical errors.

1. In the `flip()` method, the logic to swap references between `one` and `zero` is incorrect. It does not actually flip the bitset, but only swaps the references. It should actually update the values of the bits.

2. In the `toString()` method, the check for whether the index exists in `zero` should be replaced with an `else` condition, as each index should either be in `one` or `zero`.

Fix:

```java
    public void flip() {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (one.contains(i)) {
                one.remove(i);
                zero.add(i);
            } else if (zero.contains(i)) {
                zero.remove(i);
                one.add(i);
            }
        }
    }

    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (one.contains(i)) {
                sb.append("1");
            } else {
                sb.append("0");
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
```

I have updated the `flip()` method to correctly flip the bitset by updating the values of the bits. I have also simplified and fixed the logical error in the `toString()` method.
