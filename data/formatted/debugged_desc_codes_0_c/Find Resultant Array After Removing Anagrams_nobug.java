The given Java code aims to remove anagrams from the input string array `words` based on a specific condition. It sorts each word in the array and compares it with the previous word. If they are not equal, the current word is added to a result list.

Bug:
The code does not consider the condition stated in the problem to remove anagrams, i.e., selecting an index i such that 0 < i < words.length and words[i - 1] and words[i] are anagrams, and deleting words[i] from words. In the given code, anagrams are not removed as per the condition.

Fix:
We need to identify words that are anagrams and then remove them based on the given condition.

Here's the modified code that addresses the bug:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> removeAnagrams(String[] words) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            boolean isAnagram = false;
            for (String existingWord : result) {
                if (areAnagrams(existingWord, word)) {
                    isAnagram = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isAnagram) {
                result.add(word);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    // Function to check if two strings are anagrams
    private boolean areAnagrams(String word1, String word2) {
        if (word1.length() != word2.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] charArray1 = word1.toCharArray();
        char[] charArray2 = word2.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(charArray1);
        Arrays.sort(charArray2);
        return Arrays.equals(charArray1, charArray2);
    }
}
```

In the modified code:
1. We iterate through the input words and check if each word is an anagram of any word already in the `result` list.
2. We added a helper function `areAnagrams` to check if two strings are anagrams by sorting the characters and comparing the arrays.
3. If the word is not an anagram of any existing word, we add it to the `result` list.

This way, the code correctly removes anagrams based on the given conditions.
