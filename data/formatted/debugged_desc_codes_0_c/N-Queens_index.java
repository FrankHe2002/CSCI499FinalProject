The code seems to be attempting to solve the N-Queens puzzle using backtracking and recursion. However, there is a bug in the 'copyBoardToAns' method that is causing it to produce incorrect results.

Here's the step-by-step process to identify and fix the bug:

1. Analyzing the 'copyBoardToAns' method:
   - The loop conditions for iterating over the rows and columns of the board seem to be incorrect. 
   - The condition `if (board[i][j + 1] == 1)` should be `if (board[i][j] == 1)` to check if there is a queen placed at the current position.

2. Identify the Fix:
   - Change the condition in the 'copyBoardToAns' method to `if (board[i][j] == 1)`.

3. Apply the Fix:

```java
public void copyBoardToAns(int[][] board) {
    List<String> res = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        String row = "";
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == 1) {  // Fixed condition from board[i][j + 1] to board[i][j]
                row += "Q";
            } else {
                row += ".";
            }
        }
        res.add(row);
    }
    ans.add(res);
}
```

With this fix, the 'copyBoardToAns' method should correctly generate the board configurations with the queens placed in the correct positions.

This should resolve the bug and produce the correct solutions for the N-Queens puzzle.
