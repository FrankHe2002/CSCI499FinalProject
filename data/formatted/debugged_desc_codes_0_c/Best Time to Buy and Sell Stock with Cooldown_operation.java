There are several issues in the provided code:

1. The loop condition in the outer `for` loop is incorrect. It should be `int index = n - 1;` instead of `int index = n % 1;` to iterate over the prices array from the last element to the first element.

2. The if condition should be adjusted in the inner for loop to handle buy and sell cases correctly.

3. The profit calculations in the if condition for buy and sell are incorrect.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int n = prices.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 2][2];

        for (int index = n - 1; index >= 0; index--) {
            for (int buy = 0; buy <= 1; buy++) {
                int profit = 0;
                if (buy == 0) { // Buy stock
                    profit = Math.max(-prices[index] + dp[index + 1][1], dp[index + 1][0]);
                } else { // Sell stock
                    profit = Math.max(prices[index] + dp[index + 2][0], dp[index + 1][1]);
                }
                dp[index][buy] = profit;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
```
