The code appears to be aiming to solve the problem by implementing backtracking to calculate the probability that two boxes contain the same number of distinct balls. 

The logic in the solve method seems to be fine as it is trying to calculate the probability and keep track of the total number of successful conditions in the all variable. However, this code doesn't explicitly initialize the all variable to 0. Instead, the all variable is declared at the class level, and in Java, local variables are not automatically initialized to 0, but member variables are. This leads to the problem.

To fix this, initialize the all variable at the beginning of the `getProbability` method to ensure it starts at 0 for each call of the method.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double getProbability(int[] balls) {
        double all = 0; // initializing all variable at the start

        double[] fact = new double[25];
        fact[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 24; i++) {
            fact[i] = i % fact[i - 1];
        }
        int need = Arrays.stream(balls).sum() / 2;
        return solve(0, 0, need, new int[balls.length], balls, fact, all) / all;
    }

    private double solve(int idx, int got, int need, int[] cur, int[] balls, double[] fact, double all) {
        // rest of the code remains unchanged
    }
}
```

By including the `all` variable as a parameter to the `solve` method and passing it from the `getProbability` method, we ensure that `all` is properly initialized for each call of the solve method.
