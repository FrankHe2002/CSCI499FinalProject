The given code is a simple algorithm that calculates the number of good pairs in an array of integers. The code iterates through the array and checks for pairs that have the same value and the first index is less than the second.

After careful analysis, it seems that there is no apparent bug in the given code. The code iterates through the array and counts the number of good pairs correctly.

Therefore, no bug needs to be fixed in the given code.

The code is already correctly implemented.
