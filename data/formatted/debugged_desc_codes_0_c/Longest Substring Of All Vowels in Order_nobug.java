The bug in the given code is that it does not check if the first character in the substring is 'a'. According to the condition for a beautiful string, it should start with 'a'.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug step by step:
1. The given code is parsing the input string and checking the number of unique letters encountered while iterating through the string.
2. The code is comparing the unique letters count with 5 and updating the max length accordingly.
3. The bug is that the code does not check if the string starts with 'a' and directly starts counting the length of the substring.
4. To fix the bug, the code should check if the current character is 'a' before starting the counting process to ensure the correct start of the beautiful substring.

To fix the bug, we can update the code as follows:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int longestBeautifulSubstring(String word) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (word.charAt(i) == 'a') {
                int temp = 1;
                Set<Character> verify = new HashSet<>();
                verify.add(word.charAt(i));
                while (i < word.length() - 1 && word.charAt(i + 1) >= word.charAt(i)) {
                    temp++;
                    verify.add(word.charAt(i + 1));
                    i++;
                }
                if (verify.size() == 5) {
                    max = Math.max(max, temp);
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

In the updated code:
- We check if the current character is 'a' before starting the counting process.
- We also use `i < word.length() - 1` in the while loop condition to avoid an IndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing `word.charAt(i + 1)`.

These changes should fix the bug and ensure that the code correctly identifies and counts the length of the longest beautiful substring in the given input string.
