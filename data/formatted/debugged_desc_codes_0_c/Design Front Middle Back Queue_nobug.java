The code seems to be fine, but it's crucial to test and validate the implementation of the FrontMiddleBackQueue methods. The method pushMiddle is manipulating the elements of the deque to maintain the "two middle position choices" requirement properly. Additionally, the methods popFront, popMiddle, and popBack are handling the edge cases correctly by ensuring that they return -1 if the queue is empty.

There doesn't seem to be any bug in the provided code.

To ensure the reliability of the functionality, thorough unit testing should be performed. However, based on the code, it seems to be accurately implementing the required operations.

So, given that the code appears to be correct and is functioning according to the expected behavior, no debugging is necessary at this time.
