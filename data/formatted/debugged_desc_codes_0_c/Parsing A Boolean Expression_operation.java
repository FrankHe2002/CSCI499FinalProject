The given code seems to be buggy as it would not handle complex boolean expressions properly. The main bug is in the `solve` method where the logic to handle the expression is incorrect.

Here are the steps to identify and fix the bug:

1. `solve` method is supposed to handle the entire expression, but it seems to only handle one part of the expression and return. It should be revised so that it handles the entire expression recursively.

2. The condition `if (flag_res_init == 1 || prev_sign == '!')` does not appear to be correct. The intention here seems to be to check if the result is already initialized or the previous sign was a logical NOT. This needs to be re-evaluated.

3. There might be a bug in the evaluation of compound expressions with logical AND ("&") or logical OR ("|").

4. The process of parsing each character doesn't seem to be clear and can be simplified.

Here is the revised code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    int pos = 0;

    public boolean parseBoolExpr(String s) {
        pos = 0;
        return solve(s, '%');
    }

    public boolean solve(String s, char prev_sign) {
        boolean res = false;
        boolean isNegation = prev_sign == '!';
        char cur_sign = ' ';
        if (isNegation) {
            // Ignore '(' for negation operation
            pos++;
        }
        while (pos < s.length()) {
            char cur_char = s.charAt(pos++);
            if (cur_char == 'f' || cur_char == 't') {
                if (isNegation) {
                    res = ! (cur_char == 't');
                    isNegation = false;
                } else {
                    res = cur_char == 't';
                }
            } else if (cur_char == '|' || cur_char == '&') {
                cur_sign = cur_char;
            } else if (cur_char == '(') {
                boolean subExprVal = solve(s, cur_sign);
                res = eval(res, subExprVal, prev_sign);
                cur_sign = ' '; // reset the current sign for next sub expression
            } else if (cur_char == ')') {
                return res;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    public boolean eval(boolean e1, boolean e2, char sign) {
        if (sign == '!')
            return !e1;
        else if (sign == '|')
            return e1 || e2;
        else // for '&'
            return e1 && e2;
    }
}
```
In the revised code, the `solve` method has been refactored to handle the entire boolean expression recursively. The conditions for handling each character have been clarified and simplified. The `eval` method has been updated for proper evaluation of logical NOT, AND, and OR operations.
