Bug Type:
Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is attempting to permute the characters in s to match the order in order.
2. The code is looping through each character in s and checking if it exists in order using `order.indexOf(actualChar)`.
3. If it does not exist in order, it appends the character to the `finalString`, otherwise, it stores the character and its count in `hm`.
4. Finally, it loops through the characters in order and appends them to the `finalString` based on their count in `hm`.

The bug in the code is with the for loop that iterates through the characters in s. The loop starts with i = -1, which causes an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to get the character at index -1 in s.

Also, in `hm.put(actualChar, hm.getOrDefault(actualChar, 0) + 1);` the line stores the actualChar as the key in the hashmap. But the flow of operations needs to be determined irrespective of the order. So, use actualChar as a key and its frequency in the string as value.

Therefore, in order to fix the bug, the code needs to start the loop at i = 0 and use actualChar as a key in hm with its count in s.

The fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public String customSortString(String order, String s) {
        if (s.length() <= 1) return s;

        StringBuilder finalString = new StringBuilder();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char actualChar = s.charAt(i);

            if (order.indexOf(actualChar) == -1) {
                finalString.append(actualChar);
            } else {
                hm.put(actualChar, hm.getOrDefault(actualChar, 0) + 1);
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < order.length(); i++) {
            char actualChar = order.charAt(i);

            if (hm.containsKey(actualChar)) {
                for (int j = 0; j < hm.get(actualChar); j++) {
                    finalString.append(actualChar);
                }
            }
        }

        return finalString.toString();
    }
}
```
