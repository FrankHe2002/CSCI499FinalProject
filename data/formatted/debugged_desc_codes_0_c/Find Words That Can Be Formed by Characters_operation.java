The provided code involves finding strings in the given array that can be formed by characters from the given string `chars`. The code uses an array `freq` to store the frequency of characters in `chars` and then loops through each word in the array `words` to check if it can be formed by the characters in `chars`. If so, the length of the word is added to the `result`.

There is an issue with the line:
```java
freq[chars.charAt(i) % 'a']++;
```
Here, the code is trying to calculate the position of the character in the alphabet by using the modulo operation. However, the result is not accurate because it does not handle lowercase letters other than 'a'. It calculates 'a' as 0, 'b' as 1, and so on, but the process will not work correctly for other characters. For example, if `chars` contains the character 'z', then `(chars.charAt(i) % 'a')` will be 25, while 'z' should be 25 - 'a' = 25 - 97 = -72.

We need to fix the line to accurately calculate the position of the character in the alphabet and update the frequency.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int countCharacters(String[] words, String chars) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length(); i++) {
            freq[chars.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            int[] copy = Arrays.copyOf(freq, freq.length);
            boolean pass = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < word.length(); j++) {
                if (-- copy[word.charAt(j) - 'a'] < 0) {
                    pass = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (pass) {
                result += word.length();
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, we are directly subtracting the character 'a' from the ASCII value of each character in `chars` to get the accurate position of the character in the alphabet. Once this fix is applied, the code is expected to work correctly and provide the length of all good strings in `words`.
