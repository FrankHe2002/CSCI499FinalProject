The bug in the code appears to be in the line `temp %= nums[i];`, which is intended to update the `temp` variable to the remainder of `temp` divided by `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[i - 1]`. This doesn't make sense as `temp` is meant to store the sum of the ascending subarray. 

To fix the issue, the `+=` operator should be used instead of the `%=` operator. 

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAscendingSum(int[] nums) {
        int res = nums[0], temp = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1])
            	temp += nums[i];
            else
                temp = nums[i];
            res = Math.max(res, temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
