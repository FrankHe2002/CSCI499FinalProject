The code compares the two input strings and returns the length of the longest string among the two. However, this is not the correct implementation of finding the longest uncommon subsequence between two strings.

The bug in the code is that it returns the length of the longer string among the two, while the correct implementation should return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to identify if either of the input strings is not a subsequence of the other. If so, then that string is the longest uncommon subsequence.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.7 MB (Top 58.87%)
class Solution {
    public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
        if (a.equals(b)) return -1;
        return Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
    }
    
    private boolean isSubsequence(String a, String b) {
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < b.length() && j < a.length(); i++) {
            if (a.charAt(j) == b.charAt(i)) {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j == a.length();
    }

    public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
        if (a.equals(b)) return -1;
        if (isSubsequence(a, b) || isSubsequence(b, a)) {
            return Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
        } else {
            return Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
        }
    }
}
```
