The code is supposed to check if an integer n is a power of three. However, there seems to be a typo in the method signature "isPowerOfThreeint" instead of "isPowerOfThree(int n)". 

Here's the fixed code with the corrected method signature:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        if (n <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        if (n % 3 != 0 && n > 1) {
            return false;
        } else {
            return isPowerOfThree(n / 3); // recursion
        }
    }
}
```

The code has been fixed by correcting the method signature from "isPowerOfThreeint n" to "isPowerOfThree(int n)". This should resolve the bug in the code.
