Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
The code logic looks correct at first glance, but there is a logical error in the condition `if (first != null || num > first)`. This condition always evaluates to true because `first != null` is always true if `first` is null and `num > first` will be true for any value of `num` when `first` is null. This results in the first, second, and third values being assigned incorrectly.

Additionally, the condition `if (num.equals(first) || num.equals(second) || num.equals(third)) continue;` will cause issues when there are duplicate values in the array. This will prevent the correct counting of distinct maximum numbers.

Fix:
1. Initialize `first`, `second`, and `third` with `Long.MIN_VALUE` instead of null to avoid any issues with null values.
2. Add a condition to check for duplicates and avoid incrementing the distinct maximum counter if the number is a duplicate.

Here's the corrected code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        long first = Long.MIN_VALUE, second = Long.MIN_VALUE, third = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == first || num == second || num == third) continue; // Check for duplicates
            if (num > first) {
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = num;
            } else if (num > second) {
                third = second;
                second = num;
            } else if (num > third) {
                third = num;
            }
        }
        
        return (third == Long.MIN_VALUE) ? (int) first : (int) third;
    }
}
```
