The bug in the provided code is a typo in the method signature. The opening square bracket is missing after "int," and there is a space in "int[" instead of "int[". 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 67.33%) | Memory: 55.1 MB (Top 5.58%)
class Solution {
    public int[] replaceElements(int[] arr) {
        int greatElement = -1;
        for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = greatElement;
            greatElement = Math.max(temp, greatElement);
        }
        arr[arr.length - 1] = -1; // Replace the last element with -1
        return arr;
    }
}
```
