The code provided appears to be a straightforward implementation of the problem as described. To identify potential bugs, consider the constraints and the logic implemented in the code. As the constraints mention that `1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000`, no explicit boundaries checking is necessary.

The code iterates through the arrays `startTime` and `endTime` and increments the `count` if the `queryTime` falls within the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.

Upon review, there are no apparent bugs in the given code.

Therefore, there is no bug to fix in the provided code.

The code is already correct as it is.
