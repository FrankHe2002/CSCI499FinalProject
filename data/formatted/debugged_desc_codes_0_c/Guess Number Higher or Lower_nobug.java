The bug in the provided code is related to the calculation of the `mid` value inside the binary search algorithm.

The bug is in the line:

```java
int mid = ((right - left) / 2) + left;
```

When calculating the `mid` value, the code uses `((right - left) / 2) + left` to find the middle point.

This can lead to an issue when `left` and `right` are both large numbers (close to the upper bound of the integer range). The calculation `right - left` can cause an overflow when the numbers are large, resulting in a negative `mid` value or an incorrect value, leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can change the calculation to use the following formula for finding the middle point:

```java
int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
```

This formula is a standard way to find the middle point in a range, avoiding the overflow issue. By using this formula, we ensure that the middle point is calculated correctly and the binary search algorithm works as intended.

Here's the revised code with the fix implemented:

```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (guess(mid) == 0)
                return mid;
            else if (guess(mid) < 0)
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                left = mid + 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
}
```
