There is a bug in the code. The bug type is a logical error. 

Here's the step-by-step process for identifying and fixing the bug:

1. The code should return the number of steps needed to water all the plants. The variable `count` is used to keep track of the steps, so it's likely that the bug is related to how it is being incremented.

2. The initial capacity `c` of the watering can is set to `capacity`, and it correctly decrements the capacity when watering a plant. 

3. However, if the capacity is not sufficient to water the current plant, the code resets `c` to `capacity`, then it incorrectly updates `count` using the expression `count = count + i + (i + 1)`. 

4. The expression `count = count + i + (i + 1)` updates `count` incorrectly, causing the bug. It should update `count` with the number of steps to reach the river, refill the watering can, and move back to the current plant.

To fix the bug, I will update the expression `count = count + i + (i + 1)` to correctly calculate the steps needed to reach the river, refill the watering can, and move back to the current plant.

```java
class Solution {
    public int wateringPlants(int[] plants, int capacity) {
        int count = 0, c = capacity;
        for (int i = 0; i < plants.length; i++) {
            if (c >= plants[i]) {
                c -= plants[i];
                count++;
            } else {
                c = capacity;
                count = count + 2 * (i + 1); // Fix: Update the number of steps needed to reach the river and move back to the current plant
                c -= plants[i];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

After applying the fix, the updated expression `count = count + 2 * (i + 1)` correctly calculates the steps needed to reach the river, refill the watering can, and move back to the current plant. This should fix the logical error in the code.
