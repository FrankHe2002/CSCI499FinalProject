The bug in the provided Java code is in the `pop` method. The code currently returns `stack[top + 1]` after decrementing `top`. This will actually return the element at the index `top`, not the top element of the stack.

Here's how to identify and fix the bug step by step:
1. Identify the purpose of the `pop` method, which is to remove and return the top element of the stack.
2. Carefully review the implementation of the `pop` method, and specifically the line `return stack[top + 1];`.
3. Understand that this line should be changed to `return stack[top];` to correctly return the top element of the stack before decrementing the `top` index.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
// Runtime: 8 ms (Top 70.94%) | Memory: 50.6 MB (Top 37.77%)

class CustomStack {

    int[] stack;
    int top;

    public CustomStack(int maxSize) {
        // intialise the stack and the top
        stack = new int[maxSize];
        top = -1;
    }

    public void push(int x) {
        // if the stack is full just skip
        if (top == stack.length - 1) return;
        // add to the stack
        top++;
        stack[top] = x;
    }

    public int pop() {
        // if stack is empty return -1
        if (top == -1) return -1;
        // remove/pop the top element
        int popped = stack[top];
        top--;
        return popped;
    }

    public void increment(int k, int val) {
        // got to increment the min of the elements present in the stack and k
        int n = Math.min(top + 1, k);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            stack[i] += val;
        }
    }
}
```

The bug in the `pop` method has been fixed by changing the line `return stack[top + 1];` to `return stack[top];` to correctly return the top element before decrementing the `top` index.
