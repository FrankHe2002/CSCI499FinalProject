There is a bug in the provided code. The bug occurs when the last bit is changed without considering the position of the bit. Additionally, the current implementation of flipping the bits from the current position to the end (inclusive) is not handled in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to take into account the change in position when updating the last bit, and also handle flipping bits from the current position to the end (inclusive).

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String target) {

        int flips = 0;
        char lastBit = '0'; // Initialize last bit to '0'
        for (int i = 0; i < target.length(); i++) {
            if (target.charAt(i) != lastBit) {
                flips++;
                lastBit = target.charAt(i);
            }
        }

        return flips;
    }
}
```

In the updated code:
1. Removed the unnecessary boolean variable `lastBit` and changed it to char type.
2. Removed the conditional checks for individual bits and used a simple comparison with the last bit.
3. Updated the logic to flip bits from the current position to the end (inclusive), as it wasn't handled properly in the initial code.
4. The logic now correctly updates the last bit and counts the number of flips needed.

The bug has been fixed and the code is now free from errors.
