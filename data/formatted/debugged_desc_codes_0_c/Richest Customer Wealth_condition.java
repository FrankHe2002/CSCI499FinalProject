The bug in the code is in the for loop condition where the comparison operator is incorrect.

Here's the step-by-step process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. We need to iterate through each customer's accounts to calculate their wealth and find the richest customer.
2. Upon reviewing the code, the bug is in the for loop condition for the outer loop (i) which checks if i is greater than accounts.length, which is incorrect.
3. The condition should be i < accounts.length to iterate through each customer's accounts.
4. The inner loop (j) seems to have the correct condition and functionality.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int temp = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                temp += accounts[i][j];
            }
            res = Math.max(res, temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
