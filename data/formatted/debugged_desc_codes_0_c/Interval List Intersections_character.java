The code provided is looking for the intersection of two lists of closed intervals. 

The issue in the code is due to the condition checks in the if-else conditions. The condition checks should be strict in comparing the lower and upper bounds of the intervals. 

To fix the code, we need to adjust the condition checks in the if-else conditions to ensure that the comparisons are correct for finding the intersection of intervals.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int[][] intervalIntersection(int[][] firstList, int[][] secondList) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        while (i < firstList.length && j < secondList.length) {
            int a[] = firstList[i];
            int b[] = secondList[j];

            int startMax = Math.max(a[0], b[0]);
            int endMin = Math.min(a[1], b[1]);

            if (startMax <= endMin) {
                ans.add(new int[] {startMax, endMin});
            }

            if (a[1] < b[1]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        int res[][] = new int[ans.size()][2];

        for (i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++) {
            res[i] = ans.get(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The condition checks have been modified in the if statement to correctly determine the intersection of intervals. The new checks ensure that the startMax is less than or equal to endMin, which is the correct condition to identify the intersection. Additionally, the code has been formatted and corrected to ensure readability and correct syntax.
