The bug in the code seems to be related to the while loop. The curly braces `{}` should be added to create a code block for the while loop and properly execute the statements inside the loop.

In the given code, the while loop does not have the necessary curly braces, which causes only the first statement after the while loop to be considered as part of the loop, while the rest of the statements execute outside the loop.

Here's the corrected code with the proper curly braces added in:

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int head = 1;
        int remain = n;
        boolean left = true;
        int step = 1;

        while (remain > 1) {
            if (left || remain % 2 == 1) {
                head = head + step;
            }
            remain /= 2;
            step *= 2;
            left = !left;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

The bug has been fixed by adding the curly braces to properly define the code block for the while loop. Now the entire logic inside the while loop will execute correctly, and the code should work as intended.
