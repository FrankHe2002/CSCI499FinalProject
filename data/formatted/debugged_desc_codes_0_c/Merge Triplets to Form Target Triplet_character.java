The code should check if it's possible to obtain the target triplet by applying the operation on the input triplets. The approach seems incorrect because the current code does not handle the case for selecting two triplets i and j and updating them to reach the target triplet.

There are some issues in the code:
1. The condition `if (triplet[0] == target[0] && triplet[1] == target[1] && triplet[2] == target[2]) return true;` should not be present because we are not checking for an exact match.
2. The condition `if (triplet[0] == target[0])` and others inside the loop are incorrect as they are not handling the case for applying the operation on the triplets.

Based on the problem statement, the code should check if it is possible to obtain the target triplet by applying the operation multiple times.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean mergeTriplets(int[][] triplets, int[] target) {
        int maxX = 0, maxY = 0, maxZ = 0;
        
        for (int[] triplet : triplets) {
            if (triplet[0] <= target[0] && triplet[1] <= target[1] && triplet[2] <= target[2]) {
                maxX = Math.max(maxX, triplet[0]);
                maxY = Math.max(maxY, triplet[1]);
                maxZ = Math.max(maxZ, triplet[2]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxX == target[0] && maxY == target[1] && maxZ == target[2];
    }
}
```

I have updated the code to iterate through the input triplets and find the maximum values of each component that are less than or equal to the corresponding component of the target triplet. Finally, I check if the maximum values are equal to the components of the target triplet. This will correctly determine if it's possible to obtain the target triplet using the operation.
