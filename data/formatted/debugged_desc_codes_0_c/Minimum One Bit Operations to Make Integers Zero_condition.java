The bug in the code is in the for loop condition. The condition `for (; n == 0; n = n >> 1)` is checking if `n` is equal to 0, which is incorrect. The loop should continue running until `n` becomes 0, so the condition should be `for (; n != 0; n = n >> 1)`.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 52 ms (Top 5.71%) | Memory: 41.9 MB (Top 21.90%)
class Solution {
    public int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {

        int inv = 0;

        // xor until n becomes zero
        for (; n != 0; n = n >> 1) {

            inv ^= n;
            System.out.println(inv + " " + n);
        }

        return inv;
    }
}
```
