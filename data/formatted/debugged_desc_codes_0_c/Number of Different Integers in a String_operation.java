The code provided is a Java solution to find the number of different integers in a given string `word` after replacing every non-digit character with a space. 

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the regular expression used in the `replaceAll` method is incorrect. To fix the bug, we should replace the regular expression `[a-zA/Z]` with `[a-zA-Z]` to correctly match all lowercase English letters. 

Here's the revised code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int numDifferentIntegers(String word) {
        String[] arr = word.replaceAll("[a-zA-Z]", " ").split("\\s+");
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<String>();

        for (String str : arr) {
            if (!str.isEmpty())
                set.add(String.valueOf(Integer.parseInt(str.replaceAll("^0*", ""))));
        }

        return set.size();
    }
}
```

The regular expression has been corrected to match all lowercase English letters, and an additional conversion to `int` has been added in the set to handle the case of leading zeros in the integers. This should fix the bug.
