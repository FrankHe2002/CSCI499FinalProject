The code provided is supposed to determine and return the sum of even values in the modified `nums` array after applying each query. However, there is an issue in the implementation. 

Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The initial for-loop over `nums` to calculate the initial sum of even values is incorrect. It should sum all values of `nums` instead of filtering for even values and summing those.
2. In the second loop over `queries`, the condition to check if the number at the current index is even is also incorrect. It's using the wrong index `nums[2]` instead of using `nums[idx]`.
3. The calculation of the sum after the query update is also incorrect. It should subtract the old value at `idx` and add the new one if they are even.

Fix:
To fix the logical errors, the sum calculation while iterating over the `nums` array should be modified to sum all values. Then, update the conditions to use the correct array index. Also, adjust the sum calculation based on the old and new values at the given index.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sumEvenAfterQueries(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if ((i & 1) == 0) { // (i % 2 == 0)
                sum += i;
            }
        }
        int[] ans = new int[nums.length];
        int k = 0;
        for (int[] q : queries) {
            int val = q[0];
            int idx = q[1];
            if ((nums[idx] & 1) == 0) { // (nums[idx] % 2 == 0)
                sum -= nums[idx];
            }
            nums[idx] += val;
            if ((nums[idx] & 1) == 0) { // (nums[idx] % 2 == 0)
                sum += nums[idx];
            }
            ans[k++] = sum;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
