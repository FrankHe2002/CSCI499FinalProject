The logic appears to be correct, but the bug type seems to be an index bug. We will examine the code in more detail to see if the bug we suspect is correct.

Here's the breakdown in identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The code sorts the matchsticks array in descending order to make recursion hit the base case quicker. We don't suspect any issue with the sorting logic.
2. After sorting, the code skips all matches in the `vis` array with index > k-1. This way, the first k elements are used to find one side of the square. There doesn't appear to be an issue with this step.
3. When adding the matchstick length to the subsetSum, the condition `subsetSum + nums[i] > target` is used to skip this matchstick if it would exceed the target, which seems reasonable.
4. The issue arises in the `reverse()` method. It's included to reverse the matchsticks array, but the implementation is incorrect. Instead of reversing the array, it seems to be shifting the elements to the right. This will lead to incorrect calculations later in the code.

To fix it, we will change the `reverse` method to properly reverse the array elements without shifting.

Here's the revised code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean backtrack(int[] nums, int idx, int k, int subsetSum, int target, boolean[] vis) {
        // base case
        if (k == 0)
            return true;
        if (target == subsetSum) {
            // if one of the side is found then keep finding the other k - 1 sides starting again from the beginning
            return backtrack(nums, 0, k - 1, 0, target, vis);
        }

        // hypothesis
        for (int i = idx; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // if number is already visited or sum if out of range then skip
            if (vis[i] || subsetSum + nums[i] > target)
                continue;

            // Pruning
            // if the last position (i - 1) is not visited, that means the current combination didn't work,
            // and since this position (i) has the same value, it won't work for it as well. Thus, skip it.
            if (i - 1 >= 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1] && !vis[i  - 1])
                continue;

            vis[i] = true;
            if (backtrack(nums, i + 1, k, subsetSum + nums[i], target, vis))
                return true;

            // backtrack
            vis[i] = false;
        }

        return false;
    }

    public void reverse(int[] arr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
            arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
        }
    }

    public boolean makesquare(int[] matchsticks) {
        int sum = 0;
        int k = 4;
        int n = matchsticks.length;
        // sort the array in descending order to make the recursion hit the base case quicker
        Arrays.sort(matchsticks);
        reverse(matchsticks);

        for (int match : matchsticks)
            sum += match;

        if (sum % k != 0)
            return false;

        int target = sum / k;
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[n];

        return backtrack(matchsticks, 0, k, 0, target, vis);
    }
}
```

In this revised code, I changed the `reverse()` method to actually reverse the array. I also made a minor adjustment in the `for` loop condition within the `reverse` method for the proper reversal of array elements without shifting.
