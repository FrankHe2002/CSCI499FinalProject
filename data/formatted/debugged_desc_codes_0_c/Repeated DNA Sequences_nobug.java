The given code appears to identify repeated 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) in a given DNA string. 

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that there is a bug related to the startIndex and the window. The variable 'i' is the start index of the current 10-letter sequence and 'j' is the end index. The issue seems to be with calculating the length of the current substring (j - i + 1) and identifying the repeated sequences.

In the current implementation, the condition "j - i + 1" is used to check if the substring length is equal to 'k' (10). However, this calculation is incorrect and does not match the given problem statement's requirement of finding repeated 10-letter sequences. 

In order to address this issue, the correct condition should check for new 10-letter sequences instead of the incorrect current implementation. Additionally, the condition to check for repeated 10-letter sequences in the HashMap may also need correction.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        Set<String> resultSet = new HashSet<>();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int k = 10;

        while (j + k <= s.length()) {
            String subString = s.substring(j, j + k);
            if (!map.containsKey(subString)) {
                map.put(subString, 1);
            } else {
                map.put(subString, map.get(subString) + 1);
                resultSet.add(subString);
            }
            j++;
        }
        
        return new ArrayList<>(resultSet);
    }
}
```

Changes made:
1. Replaced the StringBuilder with substring to directly extract 10-letter sequences from the DNA string.
2. Removed unnecessary ArrayList and used a Set to store the repeated sequences.

The fixed code correctly identifies repeated 10-letter sequences within the given DNA string and returns the answer in the right format.
