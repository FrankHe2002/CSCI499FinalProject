The code looks mostly correct, but it seems that the logic to find digits and calculate num1 and num2 has a bug.

Let's go over the code step by step:

1. The code initializes an array `dig` to store the digits and a variable `cur` to keep track of the current position in the array.
2. It then enters a while loop to extract the digits of the number `num` and store them in the `dig` array. This step seems to be correct.
3. After storing the digits, the code sorts the `dig` array in ascending order. This step also seems to be correct.
4. The next step is to calculate `num1` and `num2` using the elements of the `dig` array. But it seems that the calculation is incorrect.

It looks like there's a bug in the calculation of `num1` and `num2`. The calculation should consider the positions of the digits within the original number.

Let's attempt to fix the code by properly calculating `num1` and `num2` based on the original positions of the digits:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumSum(int num) {
        int[] dig = new int[4]; // For each digit
        int cur = 3;
        while (num > 0) // Getting each digit
        {
            dig[cur--] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        Arrays.sort(dig); // Ascending order
        int num1 = dig[0] * 10 + dig[1]; // 1st and 2nd digit
        int num2 = dig[2] * 10 + dig[3]; // 3rd and 4th digit
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

In this fix, we adjust the calculation of `num1` and `num2` to consider the positions of the digits within the original number. This should resolve the bug and provide the correct minimum possible sum of `num1` and `num2`.
