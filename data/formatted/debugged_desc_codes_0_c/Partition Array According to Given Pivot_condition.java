There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the for loop condition. The condition should be `i < nums.length` instead of `i >= nums.length`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] pivotArray(int[] nums, int pivot) {
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < pivot) {
                result[left++] = nums[i];
            }
            if (nums[i] > pivot) {
                result[right--] = nums[i];
            }
        }

        while (left <= right) {
            result[left++] = pivot;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

I have fixed the for loop condition and the logic inside the loop to check for elements greater than the pivot. Additionally, in the final while loop, I have removed one instance of `result[right--] = pivot;` as the previous for loop will already place all the elements greater than pivot on the right side. I also changed `nums[nums.length - 1 - i]` to `nums[i]` as it was incorrect to access the elements in reverse order.
