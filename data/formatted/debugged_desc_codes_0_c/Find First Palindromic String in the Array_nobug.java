The code looks good at first glance, but there might be a potential bug related to the comparison of the original string and the reversed string. The comparison `s.equals(sb.reverse().toString())` may not work as expected due to the nature of StringBuilder's `reverse()` method.

To identify the bug:
1. Check if the `reverse()` method works as expected and whether the comparison between the original string and the reversed string is correct.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the simple string manipulation technique to reverse the string, then compare it with the original string.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String firstPalindrome(String[] words) {
        for (String word : words) {
            if (isPalindrome(word)) {
                return word;
            }
        }
        return "";
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String word) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = word.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (word.charAt(left) != word.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
