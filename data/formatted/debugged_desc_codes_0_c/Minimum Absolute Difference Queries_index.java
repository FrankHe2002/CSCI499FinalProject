Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code implementation seems to be logically correct in terms of solving the problem.
2. Reviewing the requirements and constraints shows that the given reasoning seems correct.
3. I will analyze the finer logic within the nested for loops to confirm the correctness of the logic. 
4. The array indices start at 0, given by the for loop conditions `for (int i = 0; i < q; ++ i)` and `for (int j = 0; j < 100; ++ j)`.
5. The array `ans[]` length is `q+1`, but the answers are stored from index `0` to `q-1`. Hence the last result is not saved. 
   This may lead to a problem when accessing the elements of `ans`.
6. There seems to be an off-by-one error in the initialization of `ans` array. It should be `new int[q]` instead of `new int[q+1]` as `q` is the size of the query array and the correct index in `ans` is `i` not `i+1`.

I will fix this by changing the initialization of the `ans[]` array to `new int[q]`.

Updated code:

class Solution {
    public int[] minDifference(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[][] count = new int[n + 1][100];
        int q = queries.length;
        int ans[] = new int[q];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++ i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 100; ++ j)
                count[i + 1][j] = count[i][j];

            ++ count[i + 1][nums[i] - 1];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < q; ++ i) {
            int low = queries[i][0];
            int high = queries[i][1] + 1;
            List<Integer> present = new ArrayList<>();
            int min = 100;

            for (int j = 0; j < 100; ++ j)
                if (count[high][j] - count[low][j] != 0)
                    present.add(j);

            for (int j = 1; j < present.size(); ++ j)
                min = Math.min(min, present.get(j) - present.get(j - 1));

            if (present.size() == 1)
                min = - 1;

            ans[i] = min;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
