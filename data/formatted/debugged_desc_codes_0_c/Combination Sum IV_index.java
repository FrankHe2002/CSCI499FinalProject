Bug Type: Logical Bug

Reasoning:
1. The code is using an array of Integers as a memoization table that stores the number of possible combinations for a given remain value.
2. The memoization array is initiated with `target + 1` elements, but the recursive function is storing the result for `remain` and reading from `remain + 1` in two places: `memo[remain + 1]` and `memo[remain]`.
3. There is also an issue with the null check and memoization assignments.

The code should be modified to:
1. Change `memo[remain + 1]` to `memo[remain]` in the `recurse` method.
2. Change `memo[remain]` to `memo[remain - 1]` in the `recurse` method.
3. Change `if (memo[remain + 1] != null)` to `if (memo[remain] != null)` in the `recurse` method.
4. Change `memo[remain] = ans` to `memo[remain - 1] = ans` in the `recurse` method.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        Integer[] memo = new Integer[target + 1];
        return recurse(nums, target, memo);
    }

    public int recurse(int[] nums, int remain, Integer[] memo) {
        if (remain < 0) return 0;
        if (memo[remain] != null) return memo[remain];
        if (remain == 0) return 1;

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            ans += recurse(nums, remain - nums[i], memo);
        }

        memo[remain - 1] = ans;
        return memo[remain - 1];
    }
}
```
