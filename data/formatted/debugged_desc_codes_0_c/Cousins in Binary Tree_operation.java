The code is using a breadth-first search to traverse the tree and identify the parents of the given nodes x and y. However, the code does not consider the depth of the nodes, which is a requirement for them to be considered cousins.

The bugs in the code are related to not tracking the depth of the nodes correctly and not checking if the nodes have the same depth with different parents.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Keep a separate map to track the parent and the depth of each node while doing the breadth-first search.
2. Then, after BFS, check if the nodes have the same depth and different parents.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 20.27*) | Memory: 42 MB (Top 40.06%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isCousins(TreeNode root, int x, int y) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> parentMap = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> depthMap = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);
        parentMap.put(root.val, null);
        depthMap.put(root.val, 0);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode parent = q.remove();
            int depth = depthMap.get(parent.val);

            if (parent.left != null) {
                q.add(parent.left);
                parentMap.put(parent.left.val, parent.val);
                depthMap.put(parent.left.val, depth + 1);
            }

            if (parent.right != null) {
                q.add(parent.right);
                parentMap.put(parent.right.val, parent.val);
                depthMap.put(parent.right.val, depth + 1);
            }
        }

        return parentMap.get(x) != parentMap.get(y) && depthMap.get(x).equals(depthMap.get(y));
    }
}
```

In this corrected code:
- We are keeping track of the parent and depth in separate maps, `parentMap` and `depthMap`.
- After BFS, we are checking if `x` and `y` have different parents and the same depth to determine if they are cousins.
- These changes address the bugs and correctly identify the cousins in the binary tree based on the given requirements.
