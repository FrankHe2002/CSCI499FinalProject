The given code has a bug. The function always returns true, which means it always assumes Alice wins the game.

I will fix the bug by calculating the total sum of the stones in the piles and then determine if the starting position should be 0 or n-1 based on which sum is greater.

Here's the revised code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean stoneGame(int[] piles) {
        int n = piles.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = piles[i];
        }

        for (int d = 1; d < n; d++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - d; i++) {
                int j = i + d;
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(piles[i] - dp[i + 1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n - 1] > 0;
    }
}
```

In the revised code, I have added a dynamic programming approach to find the optimal move for each player based on the piles of stones. The function now properly calculates the optimal move for each player and returns true if Alice wins the game, and false if Bob wins.
