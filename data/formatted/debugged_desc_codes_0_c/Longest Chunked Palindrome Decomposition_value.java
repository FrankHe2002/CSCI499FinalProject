The bug in the code is likely in the substring comparison and the recursive call to `longestDecomposition` function. The code seems to have logic issues due to which it may not produce the correct result.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code logic for comparing the substrings and the recursive call. We should find all the valid substrings that satisfy the given conditions and then return the count of such substrings.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int longestDecomposition(String text) {
        int n = text.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if (text.substring(0, i + 1).equals(text.substring(n - 1 - i, n))) {
                return 2 + longestDecomposition(text.substring(i + 1, n - 1 - i));
            }
        }
        return (n == 0) ? 0 : 1;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
1. The comparison of substrings has been updated to include the first character of the substring.
2. The recursive call is made with updated indices for the substring, considering the first character of the substring in the comparison.

These changes should fix the bug and produce the correct result for the given problem statement.
