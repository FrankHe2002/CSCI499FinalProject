Bug type:
1. Logic Error: The logic for calculating the sum of all keys greater than the original key in the BST is incorrect.

Identifying the bug:
1. The `helperNodesVales` method fills up the `nodesValues` list by traversing the tree in pre-order and adding the node values to the list.
2. The `traverseAndAdd` method is supposed to calculate the sum of all keys greater than the original key in the BST. However, it doesn't sum the values correctly, and it also doesn't need to traverse the entire list of node values.

Fixing the bug:
1. We will use an in-order traversal to traverse the BST in reverse (right, root, left) to get the nodes in descending order.
2. We will calculate the running sum as we traverse the BST and assign it to each node's value.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;
    
    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            traverseAndAdd(root);
            return root;
        }
        return null;
    }

    private void traverseAndAdd(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            traverseAndAdd(root.right);
            sum += root.val;
            root.val = sum;
            traverseAndAdd(root.left);
        }
    }
}
```
