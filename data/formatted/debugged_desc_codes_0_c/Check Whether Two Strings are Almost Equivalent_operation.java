The code provided compares two strings `word1` and `word2` and checks if they are almost equivalent based on the frequency of each letter from 'a' to 'z'. It then returns true if they're almost equivalent and false otherwise.

Let's identify the bug type in the provided Java code:

Bug type:
1. Logical Error: The logical check in the for-loop is incorrect. The condition `if (i > 3 || i < * 3)` does not do a comparison based on the absolute difference between the frequencies of `word1` and `word2`.

Fixing the bug:

1. Initialize the map with default values for each alphabet to handle the `word2` frequency.
2. Change the condition in the for-loop to compare the absolute difference of frequencies with 3.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public boolean checkAlmostEquivalent(String word1, String word2) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Initialize map with default values for each alphabet
        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
            map.put(c, 0);
        }
        
        // Update word1 frequencies and word2 frequencies in the map
        for (int i = 0; i < word1.length(); i++) {
            map.put(word1.charAt(i), map.get(word1.charAt(i)) + 1);
            map.put(word2.charAt(i), map.get(word2.charAt(i)) - 1);
        }
        
        // Check the absolute difference of frequencies with 3
        for (int i : map.values()) {
            if (i > 3 || i < -3) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

The bug has been identified as a logical error in the comparison of frequencies. The fix involved initializing the map with default values for each alphabet and modifying the condition to compare the absolute difference with 3.
