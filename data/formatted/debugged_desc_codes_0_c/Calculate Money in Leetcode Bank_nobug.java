The code calculates the total amount of money Hercy will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day correctly by finding the sum of the full weeks and then adding the remaining days.

However, there is a logical issue inside the second for loop for calculating the left days. The increment operation ++ m should be replaced with a simple m to avoid unnecessary incrementation. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalMoney(int n) {
        int m = n / 7; //(no.of full weeks)
        int res = 0; //for result
        //calculating full weeks
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            res += 7 * (i + 3);
        }
        //calculating left days
        for (int i = 7 * m; i < n; i++) {
            res += m;  // increment the amount by current week's count
            m++; // start the next week
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
