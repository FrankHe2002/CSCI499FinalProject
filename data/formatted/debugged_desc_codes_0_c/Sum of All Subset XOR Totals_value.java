The bug in the given code appears to be in the getAns method. When calculating the XOR total for every subset of nums, the code does not consider all possible subsets. 

To identify and fix the bug:
1. The getAns method is using i + 2 and i + 1, which skips certain elements of the array when calculating the XOR total for subsets. This will result in some subsets not being considered, leading to an incorrect result.
2. To fix the bug, we need to modify the getAns method to consider all possible subsets by including and excluding each element of the array.

Here's the modified code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;

    public int subsetXORSum(int[] nums) {
        sum = 0;
        return getAns(nums, 0, 0);
    }

    int getAns(int[] arr, int i, int cur) {
        if (i == arr.length) {
            return cur;
        }
        return getAns(arr, i + 1, cur ^ arr[i]) + getAns(arr, i + 1, cur);
    }
}
```

In the modified code, the getAns method now considers both including and excluding each element at index i when calculating the XOR total for subsets, by calling itself recursively with i + 1 for both cases. This change ensures that all possible subsets are considered, and the correct XOR total for each subset is calculated.
