The code is trying to solve a problem using dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print the given string.

Upon careful review of the code, it looks mostly correct. However, during the iteration in the innermost loop, `dp[i][k - 1]` should be `dp[i][k] - 1`. This is because we are calculating the cost for the subproblem `dp[i][j]` at position `k` and `j`, where `dp[i][k]` is already calculated, and we need to check the minimum cost until `k-1`, not `k-1`.

To fix the bug, I will change `dp[i][k - 1]` to `dp[i][k] - 1`.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {

    public int strangePrinter(String s) {
        if (s.equals("")) return 0;
        int len = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[len][len];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        for (int l = 2; l <= len; l++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < len && l + i - 1 < len; i++) {
                int j = l + i - 1;
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) ? 0 : 1);
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                    if (s.charAt(k) == s.charAt(j)) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j-1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][len - 1];
    }
}
```
After making the minimal change, the bug in the code should be fixed. This should provide the correct minimum number of turns the printer needed to print the given string.
