The code looks good at first glance, with the sorting of courses and using a priority queue to keep track of the time and duration of the courses.

However, there is a bug in the if condition inside the for loop. The condition should be checking if the current course's last day is greater than the total time, not the previous course's last day. This is because the current course should be taken only if it can finish before or on its own last day, not the last day of the previous course.

To fix this bug, I will change the if condition by comparing the current course's last day with the total time.

Here is the modified code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int scheduleCourse(int[][] courses) {
        Arrays.sort(courses, (a, b) -> (a[1] - b[1]));
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (b - a));
        int time = 0;
        for (int[] course : courses) {
            time += course[0];
            pq.add(course[0]);
            if (time > course[1])
                time -= pq.poll();
        }
        return pq.size();
    }
}
```
With this fix, the code should now correctly calculate and return the maximum number of courses that can be taken.
