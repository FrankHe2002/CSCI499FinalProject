The given Java code has a bug. 

The bug is in the second for loop where it is looping until i <= n. The correct loop should be i < n because the array indexing starts from 0 and goes up to n-1. 

Also, the formula used to calculate the value of nums[i] in the first for loop seems incorrect. The correct formula should be nums[i] = nums[i] + n * (nums[nums[i]] % n). 

I will fix these issues and update the code accordingly.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] buildArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = nums[i] + n * (nums[nums[i]] % n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = nums[i] / n;

        return nums;
    }
}
```
