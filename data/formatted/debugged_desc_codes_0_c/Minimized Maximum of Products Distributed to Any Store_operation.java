There is a bug in the provided Java code. The bug is with the calculation of the number of shops required to distribute all products, which is resulting in incorrect output. 

The bug is in the `isItPossible` method where the integer division is used instead of the ceiling function to calculate the number of shops required to distribute all products. The expression `Math.ceil(products / (x * 1.0))` should be used to calculate the number of shops required to distribute the products.

I will fix this bug by changing the line `n -= Math.ceil(products / (x * 1.0));` in the `isItPossible` method.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizedMaximum(int n, int[] quantities) {

        int lo = 1;
        int hi = (int) 1e5;

        int ans = -1;

        while (lo <= hi) {

            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;

            if (isItPossible(mid, quantities, n)) {
                ans = mid;
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private boolean isItPossible(int x, int[] quantities, int n) {

        // is It Possible to distribute <= x products to each of the n shops
        for (int i = 0; i < quantities.length; i++) {
            int products = quantities[i];
            n -= (int)Math.ceil(products / (x * 1.0));
            if (n < 0)     // means it requires more than n shops to distribute all products
                return false;
        }

        return true; // distributed all products to exactly n shops
    }
}
```

I have also made the following changes:
- In the `minimizedMaximum` method, I updated the condition `hi = mid + 1;` to `hi = mid - 1;` so that the binary search works correctly.
- In the `isItPossible` method, I changed the line `n -= Math.ceil(products / (x * 1.0));` to `n -= (int)Math.ceil(products / (x * 1.0));` to ensure that the value is cast to an integer.

These changes should fix the bug and result in the correct functionality of the code.
