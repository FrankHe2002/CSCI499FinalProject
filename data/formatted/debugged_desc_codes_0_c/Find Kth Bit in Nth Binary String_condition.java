The code looks fine, but there might be a logical bug in the `func` method. It could be causing performance issues due to frequent method calls to `func` and string manipulation.

Let's start by analyzing the `func` method.
The `func` method uses recursion to calculate the binary string using the given formula. However, the recursive approach might be causing performance issues, and the logic of the method looks complicated.

We can fix this issue by using iteration to build the binary string instead of recursion. This will improve performance and simplify the code.

Here's the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    private String invert(String s) {
        char[] array = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (array[i] != '1') {
                array[i] = '1';
            } else {
                array[i] = '0';
            }
        }
        return new String(array);
    }

    private String reverse(String s) {
        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder(s);
        return str.reverse().toString();
    }

    public char findKthBit(int n, int k) {
        String s = "0";
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            String reversedInvertedS = reverse(invert(s));
            s = s + "1" + reversedInvertedS;
        }
        return s.charAt(k - 1);
    }
}
```
In this modified version of the code, we have removed the `func` method and used a simple loop to build the binary string `s` based on the given formula. By making this change, we have eliminated the performance issues caused by recursion, and the code is now more efficient and easier to understand.
