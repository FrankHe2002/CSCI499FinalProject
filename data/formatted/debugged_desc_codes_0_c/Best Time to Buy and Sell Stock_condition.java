The bug in the code is that it doesn't reset the `lsf` variable when the current price is less than `lsf`, which means that it will never re-capture the lowest stock price after encountering a higher price.

To fix this, we need to reset the `lsf` variable whenever we find a new lowest stock price and then calculate the profit. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 93.59%) | Memory: 83.9 MB (Top 46.18%)
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int lsf = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int op = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < lsf) {
                lsf = prices[i];
            }
            else {
                op = Math.max(op, prices[i] - lsf);
            }
        }
        return op;
    }
}
```
