The code seems to have issues related to forming the groups of special-equivalent strings. A fix seems to be required in the section where the HashMap is used to keep track of the groups.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems the issue is with the usage of the string `word` as the key for the hashmap. Since the `word` is being updated within the loop, it should not be used as the key for the hashmap. Instead, a new string should be created to represent the character counts of the word.

To address this issue, a new string needs to be created to represent the character counts of the word and then used as the key in the hashmap to keep track of group sizes.

The code can be fixed as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSpecialEquivGroups(String[] words) {
        if (words.length == 0 || words.length == 1) return words.length;

        // To store group sizes
        HashMap<String, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<>();

        // To mark the strings already part of some groups
        boolean[] isGrouped = new boolean[words.length];

        for (int index = 0; index < words.length; index++) {
            if (isGrouped[index]) continue; // Already grouped
            String word = words[index];
            String charCountString = getCharacterCountString(word);

            for (int j = index + 1; j < words.length; j++) {
                if (isGrouped[j]) continue; // Already grouped
                String string = words[j];
                String stringCharCountString = getCharacterCountString(string);

                if (charCountString.equals(stringCharCountString)) {
                    hashmap.put(charCountString, hashmap.getOrDefault(charCountString, 0) + 1);
                    isGrouped[j] = true;
                }
            }

            // If no group is formed, the word alone forms a group of size 1
            if (! hashmap.containsKey(charCountString)) {
                hashmap.put(charCountString, 1);
            }
        }

        return hashmap.size();
    }

    private String getCharacterCountString(String word) {
        int[] charCounts = new int[52];
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            charCounts[word.charAt(i) - 'a' + 26 * (i % 2)]++;
        }
        return Arrays.toString(charCounts);
    }
}
```
In the fixed code, a new method `getCharacterCountString` is introduced to obtain the string representation of the character counts, and this method is used to retrieve the character count strings for the words and strings being compared. The `hashCode` method is being used to generate a hash code string that is unique for each group of special equivalent strings.

This change ensures that the `word` is not modified or used as the key in the hashmap. It uses a separate string based on the character counts to represent the groups.
