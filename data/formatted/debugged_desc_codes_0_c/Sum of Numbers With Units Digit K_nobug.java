The code is designed to find the minimum possible size of a set of positive integers that has a units digit of k and whose sum is equal to num. It's using a brute force approach to find the minimum size by iterating through possible set sizes.

Potential bug:
In the condition `if (k == 0)`, the logic doesn't account for the case when num % 10 != 0 and k == 0. It should return -1 in such cases.

Thinking process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The code checks if k is 0, and it should return -1 if num % 10 is not 0 and k is 0. So, the condition should be modified to handle this edge case correctly.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumNumbers(int num, int k) {
        if (num == 0)
            return 0;
        if (k == 0) {
            if (num % 10 == 0) //E.g. 20,1590,3000
                return 1;
            else
                return -1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= num / k; i++) { // Start with set size 1 and look for set having unit's digit equal to that of num
            if (num % 10 == ((i * k) % 10)) // Look for equal unit's digit
                return i;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```

I fixed the bug by adding curly brackets after the condition `if (k == 0)` to properly handle the case of k being 0 and num % 10 not being 0. That ensures the correct behavior and returns -1 when needed.
