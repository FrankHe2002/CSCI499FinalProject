The given code seems to be buggy as it doesn't produce the expected output. Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the logic implemented to find the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods is incorrect. 

Here's the debugging, fixing, and reasoning process step-by-step:

1. The code initializes the minimum time as `s.length()` which defines the upper bound of the minimum time. The initial value of `min` should be zero as there are no illegal cars at the beginning.
    - Fix: Initializing `min` with 0.

2. The first loop calculates the time needed to remove illegal cars from the left of the sequence but it contains an off-by-one error since the `leftOptimized` array has a length of `n + 2`. 
    - Fix: Change the loop to iterate from 0 to n instead of 1 to n as the array length is `n + 2`.

3. The second loop calculates the time needed to remove illegal cars from the right of the sequence but it has a similar off-by-one error to the first loop. Additionally, the condition to update the `rightOptimized` array is incorrect as it takes into account `n - i + 1` which results in the array being 1-indexed.
    - Fix: Change the loop to iterate from n + 1 to 1 instead of n to 0, and alter the condition accordingly to `rightOptimized[i] = Math.min(i, rightOptimized[i + 1] + (nums[i - 1] != 1 ? 2 : 0));`.

4. The step3 loop has an off-by-one error due to the improper comparison in the loop. 
    - Fix: Change the condition in the loop to `p < n` instead of `p <= n`.

After making the necessary fixes, the corrected code looks like this:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumTime(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int min = 0;
        int[] nums = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = s.charAt(i) - '0';

        // step1
        int[] leftOptimized = new int[n + 2];
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            leftOptimized[i] = Math.min(i, leftOptimized[i + 1] + (nums[i] != 1 ? 2 : 0));
        }

        // step2
        int[] rightOptimized = new int[n + 2];
        for (int i = n + 1; i > 0; i--) {
            rightOptimized[i] = Math.min(n - i, rightOptimized[i + 1] + (nums[i - 1] != 1 ? 2 : 0));
        }

        // step3
        for (int p = 0; p < n; p++) {
            min = Math.min(min, leftOptimized[p] + rightOptimized[p + 1]);
        }

        return min;
    }
}
```
After the fixes, the code should work correctly to find the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.
