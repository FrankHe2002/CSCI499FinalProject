The code seems to be traversing the graph nodes and edges to find the shortest path that visits every node. 

One potential issue is the condition `if (1 << i == allVisited) return 0;` inside the for loop, which checks if the first node is already the only visited node. Since the graph is undirected and connected, it's possible to start at any node and visit every node, so this condition is incorrect.

Another issue is in the `while` loop, especially the part `if (path == allVisited) return step + 1;` This code seems to be checking whether all nodes have been visited, but it can lead to potential incorrect results. 

To fix the issue, we need to modify the initial condition and the condition inside the while loop.

Here's the revised code:

```java
class Solution {
    class Pair {
        int i;
        int path;

        public Pair(int i, int path) {
            this.i = i;
            this.path = path;
        }
    }

    public int shortestPathLength(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int allVisited = (1 << n) - 1;
        
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][1 << n];
        Queue<Pair> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            visited[i][1 << i] = true;
            q.offer(new Pair(i, 1 << i));
        }
        int step = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                Pair p = q.poll();
                int[] edges = graph[p.i];
                for (int t : edges) {
                    int path = p.path | (1 << t);
                    if (!visited[t][path]) {
                        visited[t][path] = true;
                        q.offer(new Pair(t, path));
                    }
                }
            }
            step++;
        }
        return step - 1;
    }
}
```

The bug in the initial condition and the condition inside the while loop have been fixed. The revised code should now correctly identify and return the length of the shortest path that visits every node.
