Bug type: Logical error

Issue:
1. In the TopVotedCandidate constructor, the logic to update the lead person at each time is incorrect. The lead person should be updated for every time, not only when the new count is greater than or equal to the current leader's count.

2. In the q(int t) method, the logic to find the lead person at time t is incorrect. The binary search algorithm is not correctly finding the closest time to t.

Fix:
1. Update the constructor logic to update the lead person at each time, not only when the new count is greater than or equal to the current leader's count.

2. Modify the q(int t) method to correctly find the closest time to t using a binary search, then get the lead person at that time.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class TopVotedCandidate {
    int[] persons;
    int[] times;
    int length;
    Map<Integer, Integer> voteCount;
    Map<Integer, Integer> voteLead;

    public TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) {
        this.persons = persons;
        this.times = times;
        length = times.length;
        int leadCount = 0;
        voteCount = new HashMap<>();
        voteLead = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            int newCount = voteCount.getOrDefault(persons[i], 0) + 1;
            voteCount.put(persons[i], newCount);
            if (newCount >= leadCount) {
                leadCount = newCount;
                voteLead.put(times[i], persons[i]);
            } else {
                voteLead.put(times[i], voteLead.get(times[i - 1]));
            }
        }
    }

    public int q(int t) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = length - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high + 1) / 2;
            if (times[mid] <= t) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return voteLead.get(times[low]);
    }
}
