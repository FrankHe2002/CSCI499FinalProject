Bug:
The binary search algorithm used in the `binarySearch` method has a bug. Specifically, the logic in the while loop is incorrect, leading to incorrect results when performing the binary search.

Fix:
In the while loop, the `else` block should update the `id` and `lo` pointers correctly.

Here's the corrected `binarySearch` method:

```java
private int binarySearch(List<Integer> vals, int val) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = vals.size() - 1;
        int id = -1;

        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

            if (vals.get(mid) <= val) {
                id = mid;
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        if (id < 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        return vals.size() - id;
    }
```

Explanation:
The original `binarySearch` method incorrectly updated the `id` and `lo` pointers in the `else` block, leading to incorrect results. By correcting this logic to ensure that `id` and `lo` pointers are updated appropriately, the binary search will work as expected and return the correct results. The modification introduces the `<=` condition to properly cover all the elements in the `vals` list.

Additionally, I have also changed the `lo < hi` condition in the `while` loop to `lo <= hi` to ensure that the search does not miss the value in the array when `lo` and `hi` are equal.

With these adjustments, the `binarySearch` method should work correctly and return the expected values.
