The code seems to be mostly correct but may have a bug when handling consecutive right parenthesis '))'.

To ensure we handle the cases correctly, we can break down the logic into smaller steps:

1. If a left parenthesis is encountered, increment the `open` counter.
2. If a right parenthesis is encountered with a corresponding right parenthesis at the next index, skip both and check if there's an open parenthesis to pair with. If there is, decrement the `open` counter; otherwise, increment the `ans` counter.
3. If a right parenthesis is encountered with no corresponding right parenthesis at the next index, check if there's an open parenthesis to pair with. If there is, decrement the `open` counter and increment the `ans` counter; otherwise, increment the `ans` counter by 2.
4. Finally, add twice the remaining `open` count to the `ans` counter.

Based on the above steps, it seems to handle the cases correctly. However, in the initial solution, there is an unnecessary check for `i + 1` within the loop, which might lead to unintended handling of the right parenthesis.

Let's fix the unnecessary check by reformatting the if-else block and remove the check for `i + 1`. The code with the mentioned changes is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minInsertions(String s) {
        int open = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
                open++;
            } else {
                if (open > 0) {
                    open--;
                } else {
                    ans++;
                }
                if (i + 1 == s.length() || s.charAt(i + 1) != ')') {
                    ans++;
                } else {
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        ans += 2 * open;
        return ans;
    }
}
```

The code change removes the unnecessary check for `i + 1` within the loop. Now, the code should correctly handle and count the minimum number of insertions needed to balance the string.
