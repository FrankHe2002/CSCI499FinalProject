The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error, specifically in the logic to determine the intersection size of the set S with the integer intervals.

I will identify and fix the bug step-by-step:

1. In the for loop where we iterate through each interval, we need to adjust the logic to determine the intersection size of the set S with the current interval.

2. The current logic is not correctly determining the intersection size based on the last two elements of the list. We need to redefine the conditions to accurately determine the intersection size.

3. We can change the conditions within the for loop to accurately determine the intersection size. We should compare the start and end of the current interval with the last two elements of the list to determine the intersection size. If the current start is greater than or equal to the last element and the current start is less than the second to last element, then we continue without adding the interval end. If the current start is less than the last element, then we add the interval end. Otherwise, if the current start is less than the second to last element, we need to add the interval end - 1 and then the end of the interval to ensure that the intersection size is at least two.

Here's the updated code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int intersectionSizeTwo(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                if (a[1] == b[1]) {
                    return b[0] - a[0];
                }
                return a[1] - b[1];
            }
        });

        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(intervals[0][1] - 1);
        list.add(intervals[0][1]);

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int lastOne = list.get(list.size() - 1);
            int lastTwo = list.get(list.size() - 2);
            int[] interval = intervals[i];
            int start = interval[0];
            int end = interval[1];

            if (lastOne >= start && lastTwo < start) {
                list.add(end);
            } else if (lastOne < start) {
                list.add(end - 1);
                list.add(end);
            }
        }

        return list.size();
    }
}
```

In the updated code, the logic within the for loop has been modified to accurately determine the intersection size of the set S with the integer intervals based on the start and end points of the intervals and the last two elements of the list. This fix should address the logical error in the original code.
