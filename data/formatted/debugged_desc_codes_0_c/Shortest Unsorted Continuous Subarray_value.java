The given code aims to find the length of the shortest unsorted subarray in a given integer array. The code creates a clone of the original array, sorts the original array, and then iterates through both arrays to find the starting and ending indices of the unsorted subarray.

Upon reviewing the code, the logic and implementation seem correct based on the problem description. However, there is a bug in the comparison logic within the for loop. The current approach may not capture all the elements that need to be included in the unsorted subarray.

The bug type in the code is a logical error.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted to include all the elements that are not in the correct position, rather than just comparing with the original array index. The correct approach is to sort the original array and the clone array, and then traverse from both ends to find the starting and ending indices of the unsorted subarray.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findUnsortedSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int[] numsClone = nums.clone();
        Arrays.sort(numsClone);
        
        int start = 0;
        while (start < nums.length && nums[start] == numsClone[start]) {
            start++;
        }
        
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        while (end > start && nums[end] == numsClone[end]) {
            end--;
        }
        
        return end - start + 1;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
1. The sorting is done on the clone array instead of the original array to use it for comparison.
2. The logic for finding the starting and ending indices of the unsorted subarray has been corrected by traversing from both ends.
3. The shortest unsorted subarray length is calculated using the starting and ending indices.

These changes address the bug and provide a correct solution for finding the shortest unsorted subarray length in the given integer array.
