The code appears to be trying to find the number of unique paths from a starting square to an ending square while also walking over every non-obstacle square exactly once. 

Bug:
The bug in the given code is that the count variable is not being correctly incremented and decremented while traversing through the grid.

Fix:
The `ways` method should increment the count variable before making the recursive call and then decrement it after the recursive call. This will ensure that the count is correctly incremented and decremented as the path is explored.

Code with the fix:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 41.86%) | Memory: 42.7 MB (Top 13.82%)
class Solution {
    int walk = 0;

    public int uniquePathsIII(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int startR = 0;
        int startC = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    walk++;
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    startR = i;
                    startC = j;
                }
            }
        }
        return ways(grid, startR, startC, m, n, 0);
    }

    public int ways(int[][] grid, int cr, int cc, int m, int n, int count) {
        if (cr < 0 || cr == m || cc < 0 || cc == n || grid[cr][cc] == -1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (grid[cr][cc] == 2) {
            if (count - 1 == walk) return 1;
            return 0;
        }
        grid[cr][cc] = -1;
        int ans = 0;
        int[] r = {0, 1, 0, -1};
        int[] c = {1, 0, -1, 0};
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            ans += ways(grid, cr + r[i], cc + c[i], m, n, count + 1);
        }
        grid[cr][cc] = 0;
        return ans;
    }
}
