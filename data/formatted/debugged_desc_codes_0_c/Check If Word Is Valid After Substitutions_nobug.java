Bug type:
The bug in the code is logical.

Reasoning:
The code logic checks for the presence of the "abc" pattern in the string by using a stack to track the occurrence of 'a' and 'b' and then checking for 'c'. However, the logic within the if statement only removes the 'a' and 'b' from the stack. It does not remove the 'c'.

Additionally, the code does not handle the situation when there are characters other than 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the input string.

To fix the code:
1. Update the logic in the if statement to handle the removal of 'a', 'b', and 'c' from the stack when the 'c' character is encountered.
2. Add a check to validate if the characters in the input string are only 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        // Check if the input string contains characters other than 'a', 'b', and 'c'
        if (!s.matches("[abc]+")) {
            return false;
        }

        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            // We have to work only when we get 'c'
            if (arr[i] == 'c') {
                // If we are at 'c', we should be able to remove 'a' and 'b' from the stack
                if (stack.size() >= 2 && stack.pop() == 'b' && stack.pop() == 'a') {
                    // Remove 'c' from the stack
                    if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == 'a') {
                        stack.pop();
                    } else {
                        return false;
                    }
                } else {
                    // If anywhere we get false in any condition that means this is not a valid set i.e. "abc" pattern is not present.
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                // For 'a' and 'b' we simply add.
                stack.push(arr[i]);
            }
        }

        // If we have only "abc" pattern, the stack will become empty.
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
