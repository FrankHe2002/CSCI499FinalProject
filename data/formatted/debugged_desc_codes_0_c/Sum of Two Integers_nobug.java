Bug type: Incorrect operation usage

Reasoning:
The code uses the `Integer.sum` method to find the sum of the two integers, but the requirement specifies that the sum should be found without using the operators + and -. Therefore, using the `Integer.sum` method is not in line with the requirements.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to implement the sum without using the + and - operators. We can achieve this using bitwise operations.

Code:
```java
class Solution {

    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int carry = a & b;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = carry << 1;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
