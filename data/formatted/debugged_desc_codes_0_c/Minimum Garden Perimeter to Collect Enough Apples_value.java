The given Java code is attempting to solve the problem of finding the minimum perimeter of a plot such that at least neededApples apples are inside or on the perimeter of that plot. The code calculates the number of apples within a square plot by iterating until the number of apples reaches or exceeds the neededApples value.

Let's review the code to identify any potential bugs:

1. The variable 'n' is initialized to -1. This might lead to issues related to negative values.

2. The count of apples is calculated using the formula count += (12 * n * n), which appears to be incorrect given the problem description.

To fix the issues, we need to correct the calculation of the count of apples and the initialization of variable 'n'.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumPerimeter(long neededApples) {
        long n = 0; // Initialize 'n' to 0
        long count = 0;
        while (count < neededApples) {
            n++;
            count += 12 * n * n * 4; // Calculate the count of apples correctly
        }
        return n * 8;
    }
}
```
In the fixed code, we have initialized 'n' to 0 and corrected the calculation of the count of apples to match the problem description's requirements.

The bug was related to the incorrect initialization of 'n' and the incorrect calculation of the count of apples. Both issues have been fixed in the code.
