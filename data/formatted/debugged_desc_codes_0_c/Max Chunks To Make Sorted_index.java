The following issues have been identified in the Java code:
1. The logic inside the for loop appears to be incorrect.
2. The variable max is not being used as intended. It should be used to track the maximum value encountered so far, and not arr[1].

The fix for the issues mentioned above involves making the following changes:
1. In the line `max = Math.max(arr[1], max);`, change `arr[1]` to `arr[i]` to correctly track the maximum value encountered so far.

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 40.9 MB (Top 81.61%)
class Solution {
    public int maxChunksToSorted(int[] arr) {

        int max = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(arr[i], max);
            if (i == max) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
