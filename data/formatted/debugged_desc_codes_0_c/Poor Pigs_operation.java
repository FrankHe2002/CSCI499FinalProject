The given Java code calculates the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time based on the number of buckets and the time it takes for a pig to die.

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The code calculates the number of tests that can be performed within the given time using the formula T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1.

2. It then initializes a variable "cnt" to zero, representing the count of pigs needed.

3. It initializes a variable "total" to 1, representing the total number of tests performed.

4. Then it enters a while loop and decrements "total" by "T" (the number of tests that can be performed within the given time) in each iteration and increments "cnt" by 1 until "total" becomes greater than or equal to the number of buckets.

The issue with the code is in the while loop. The intention is to keep increasing the total number of tests until it exceeds the number of buckets. However, the current implementation is subtracting "T" from "total" in each iteration instead of adding it.

To fix the bug, we should change "total -= T;" to "total += T;" inside the while loop.

Here's the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        int total = 1;
        while (total < buckets) {
            total += T; // Fix: Change subtraction to addition
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```

This fixes the bug and ensures that the total number of tests is incremented correctly in each iteration of the while loop.
