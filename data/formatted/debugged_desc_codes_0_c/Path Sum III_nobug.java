Bug type:
The bug in the code is related to the handling of cumulative sums in the hashmap and calculation of paths that equal the target sum.

Reasoning:
1. The `c_sum` (current sum) is being calculated and used as a key in the hashmap to store the frequency of cumulative sums. This has the potential to cause a collision if two paths with different sequences of nodes have the same cumulative sum. The use of `long` data type for `c_sum` and `tgt` is correct, but the key in the hashmap should be based on a unique identifier for each path, incorporating the node values and their positions.

2. The condition `c_sum == tgt` is being checked, but it is not handling the case when a path can contain negative values. Any path from the root to a leaf node can satisfy the condition of sum equal to `tgt`. Therefore, the calculation of the path sum should not terminate at `c_sum == tgt`.

3. The hashmap is being updated to store the frequency of cumulative sums, but there is no handling of the initial condition when the cumulative sum equals the target sum.

Fix:
1. Change the key in the hashmap to be a concatenated string of the node values and positions to ensure each path has a unique identifier.

2. Modify the condition for counting paths to always increment `res` if the current sum equals the target sum.

3. Update the code to handle the initial condition when the cumulative sum equals the target sum.

```java
class Solution {
    public int pathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        hm.put("0,0", 1); // handle initial condition if c_sum == target sum

        return solve(hm, root, targetSum, 0, 0);
    }

    public int solve(HashMap<String, Integer> hm, TreeNode node, long targetSum, long currentLevel, int res) {
        if (node == null)
            return 0;

        currentLevel += node.val;

        if (currentLevel == targetSum) // increment res if the sum equals target sum
            res++;

        res += hm.getOrDefault(String.valueOf(currentLevel - targetSum) + "," + node.val, 0);

        hm.put(String.valueOf(currentLevel) + "," + node.val, hm.getOrDefault(String.valueOf(currentLevel) + "," + node.val, 0) + 1);

        res += solve(hm, node.left, targetSum, currentLevel, 0);
        res += solve(hm, node.right, targetSum, currentLevel, 0);

        hm.put(String.valueOf(currentLevel) + "," + node.val, hm.getOrDefault(String.valueOf(currentLevel) + "," + node.val, 0) - 1); // remove the calculated cumulative sum

        return res;
    }
}
```
