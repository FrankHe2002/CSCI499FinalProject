Bug type:
The bug in the code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
1. The while loop should run as long as j is greater than 0, not less than or equal to 0.
2. The condition for the while loop should be `j > 0` instead of `j <= 0`.

Fix:
Modify the condition in the while loop to `j > 0`.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] mostCompetitive(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] stack = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            while (j > 0 && stack[j - 1] > nums[i] && j + nums.length - i > k) {
                j--;
            }
            if (j < k) {
                stack[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return stack;
    }
}
```
