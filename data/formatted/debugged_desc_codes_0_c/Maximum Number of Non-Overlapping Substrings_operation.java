Bug type: Logical error

The code seems to be returning incorrect results because the logic implemented for finding the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings that fulfill the given conditions appears to be flawed. The current implementation does not handle the conditions correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Here's the process for identifying and fixing the bug step-by-step:

1. The first step is to carefully read and understand the problem statement to identify the requirements and conditions for the substrings.

2. Next, review the code and understand the logic implemented to find the substrings.

3. Review the implementation of the conditions and the logic used to determine the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings.

4. Identify any incorrect assumptions or misinterpretations of the conditions that could lead to incorrect results.

5. Apply the necessary changes to the implementation to correct the logic or conditions used for finding the substrings.

The logic used to merge character ranges and determine the valid substrings needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code to fix the logic for finding the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> maxNumOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] R = new int[26];
        int[] L = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(R, -1);
        Arrays.fill(L, n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            L[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = Math.min(L[s.charAt(i) - 'a'], i);
            R[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = Math.max(R[s.charAt(i) - 'a'], i);
        }
        
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {
            int r = R[s.charAt(i) - 'a'];
            int j = i;
            while (j <= r) {
                int l = L[s.charAt(j) - 'a'];
                if (l < i) {
                    r = -1;
                    break;
                }
                r = Math.max(r, R[s.charAt(j) - 'a']);
                j++;
            }
            if (r == -1) {
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            ans.add(s.substring(i, r + 1));
            i = r + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.maxNumOfSubstrings("adefaddaccc"));
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the logic for finding the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings has been restructured based on the correct interpretation of the given conditions. The new logic iterates through the string to find the valid substrings, and a list of valid substrings is populated and returned.
