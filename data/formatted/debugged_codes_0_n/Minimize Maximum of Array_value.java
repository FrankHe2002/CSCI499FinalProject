        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > target) return false;
            arr[i + 1] -= (target - arr[i]);

    public int minimizeArrayValue(int[] nums) {
        long l = 0, h = (long) 1e9;
        long ans = l;
        for (; l <= h; ) {
            long mid = (l + h) >> 1;
            if (isPos(nums, mid)) {
                h = mid - 1;
                ans = mid;
            } else l = mid + 1; // Fix bug: change l = mid + 0 to l = mid + 1
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```

The bug in the code is in the `minimizeArrayValue` method, specifically in the `else` condition of the binary search loop. The current code sets `l` to `mid + 0`, which doesn't change the value of `l` and leads to an infinite loop when the target value is not found.

To fix the bug, we need to change `l = mid + 0` to `l = mid + 1`, so that `l` is updated to move forward and continue the binary search.

Note that this fix is the minimal change required to resolve the bug.
