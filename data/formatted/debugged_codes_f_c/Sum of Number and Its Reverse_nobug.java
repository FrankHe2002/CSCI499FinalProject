Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The buggy code initializes a static `HashSet` with integers that are formed by adding a number to its reverse. However, the code generates the set incorrectly. The loop condition `i <= 100000` should be `i < 100000` to ensure that integers up to 100000 are included. Additionally, the code calls `Integer.parseInt()` on the reversed string representation of `i`, which leads to unnecessary string conversion.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    static HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

    static {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            int reverse = reverseNumber(i);
            set.add(i + reverse);
        }
    }

    public boolean sumOfNumberAndReverse(int num) {
        return set.contains(num);
    }
    
    private int reverseNumber(int num) {
        int reversed = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            reversed = reversed * 10 + num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return reversed;
    }
}
```
