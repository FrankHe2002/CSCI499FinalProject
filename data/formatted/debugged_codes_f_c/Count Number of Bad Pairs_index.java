Bug Type: Compilation Error, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The line `int diff = i - nums[HashMap];` causes a compilation error. The variable `HashMap` is not a valid index for the `nums` array. It should be `nums[i]`.
2. The line `int diff = i - nums[i];` calculates the difference between the current index `i` and the value at index `i` in the `nums` array. However, to find the difference between elements, it should be `int diff = nums[i] - i;`. This fixes the logical error in calculating the difference.
3. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < nums.length`, which is the correct range since Java arrays have indices from 0 to `length - 1`.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long countBadPairs(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        long count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int diff = nums[i] - i;
            if (seen.containsKey(diff)) {
                count += (i - seen.get(diff));
            } else {
                count += i;
            }
            seen.put(diff, seen.getOrDefault(diff, 0) + 1);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
