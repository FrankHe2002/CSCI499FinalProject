Bug Type: Logic error

Reasoning: Upon analyzing the provided code, it can be observed that the issue lies in the logic of the code. The goal of the code is to calculate the tax based on specific brackets and income. However, the logic used to calculate the tax is incorrect.

Fix: To fix the code and correctly calculate the tax, the logic needs to be adjusted. The new approach involves iterating over the brackets and checking if the income falls within each bracket. If it does, the tax is calculated based on the bracket rate and the portion of income in that bracket. The updated code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public double calculateTax(int[][] brackets, int income) {
        double ans = 0;
        for (int[] arr : brackets) {
            if (income <= 0) {
                break;
            }
            
            int bracketSize = arr[0] - arr[1];
            int taxableIncome = Math.min(income, bracketSize);
            
            double tax = (double) (taxableIncome * arr[2]) / 100;
            ans += tax;
            
            income -= taxableIncome;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

The updated code correctly calculates the tax based on the given brackets and income.
