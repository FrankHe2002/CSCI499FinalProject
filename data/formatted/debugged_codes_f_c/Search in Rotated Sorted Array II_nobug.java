Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code is an implementation of the search algorithm in a rotated sorted array. There are two identified bugs in this code.

Bug 1:
The first bug is in the while loop used to find the index of the smallest element, which is essentially finding the rotation point. Within the loop, there are two inner while loops that increment or decrement the left and right pointers if the adjacent elements are equal. The issue is that these inner while loops do not update the values of left and right correctly.

Bug 2:
The second bug is the incorrect assignment of left and right indices after finding the rotation point. The code incorrectly assigns the values of start and right while keeping left as 0.

To fix these bugs, the following changes need to be made:

1. Remove the inner while loops, as they are not necessary and are causing incorrect updates of the pointers. The condition checks for adjacent element equality and increments or decrements only once, so there is no need for these inner while loops.

2. After finding the rotation point, assign the values of start and right to left and right respectively. This will ensure that the correct portion of the array is considered for the binary search.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return false;

        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        int start = 0;

        // Find index of the smallest element
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        // Figure out in which side our target lies
        start = left;
        left = 0;
        right = nums.length - 1;
        if (target >= nums[start] && target <= nums[right])
            left = start;
        else right = start;

        // Run normal binary search in sorted half.
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return true;

            if (nums[mid] > target) right = mid - 1;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
