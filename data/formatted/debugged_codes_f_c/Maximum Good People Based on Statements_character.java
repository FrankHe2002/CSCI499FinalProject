Buggy Code Explanation:

1. There is a typo in the method signature. The opening parentheses of the `maximumGood` method are missing, causing a compilation error. Fixing this typo and properly closing the parentheses resolves the error.

2. Within the `maximumGood` method, there is a missing closing square bracket (`]`) in the method signature. Adding the missing closing square bracket fixes the error.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 98.48%) | Memory: 42.5 MB (Top 63.64%)
class Solution {
    public int maximumGood(int[][] statements) {
        int[] result = {0};
        maximumGood(statements, new boolean[statements.length], 0, 0, result);
        return result[0];
    }

    /*
        This function uses backtracking to do the DFS. We are basically constructing all possible scenarios and verifying them.

        statements (int[][]): This is the input statements.
        goodPeople (boolean[]): This array tells who are good and bad in the group.
        currentPerson (int): This is the current person that we are verifying.
        currentGoodPeople (int): This is the number of the good people identified so far.
        result (int[]): This array holds the result, the total number of good people.
    */
    private void maximumGood(int[][] statements, boolean[] goodPeople, int currentPerson, int currentGoodPeople, int[] result) {
        if (currentPerson == goodPeople.length) {
            result[0] = Math.max(result[0], currentGoodPeople);
            return;
        }

        // Now we are going to use backtracking to do DFS.

        // Scenario 1: Assume the current person is good and verify it.
        goodPeople[currentPerson] = true;
        // Prune the tree if the sum of unverified people (goodPeople.length - currentPerson) and verifyied good people (currentGoodPeople) is less than the result.
        if (goodPeople.length - currentPerson + currentGoodPeople < result[0]) {
            return;

            maximumGood(statements, goodPeople, currentPerson + 1, currentGoodPeople + 1, result);
        }

        // Scenario 2: Assume the current person is bad and verify it.
        goodPeople[currentPerson] = false;
