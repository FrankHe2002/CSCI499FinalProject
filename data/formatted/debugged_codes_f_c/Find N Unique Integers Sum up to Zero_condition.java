Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Looking at the provided code, we can see that the method is supposed to return an array of size `n` where the elements add up to 0. The logic for generating the array is not correct. The first for loop is correctly assigning positive integers to the array, but the second for loop has a logical error. The condition `i > n / 2` will always evaluate to false because `i` is initialized as 1 and `n/2` will always be larger than 1. As a result, the second for loop is not executed, and the array elements are not assigned correctly.

Fix: To fix this bug, we need to change the condition of the second for loop to `i <= n / 2`, allowing it to execute and assign the negative integers to the array.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sumZero(int n) {
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        int j = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
            ans[j] = i;
            j++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
            ans[j] = -i;
            j++;
        }
        if (n % 2 != 0) ans[j] = 0;

        return ans;
    }
}
```
