Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The bug in the code is that it is comparing the current price with the first price (prices[0]) instead of comparing it with the previous price (prices[i]). This means that the code is not calculating the correct profit. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if (prices[i + 1] > prices[i])`, which compares the current price with the previous price to determine if a profit can be made. 

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length, profit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (prices[i + 1] > prices[i]) {
                profit += prices[i + 1] - prices[i];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
