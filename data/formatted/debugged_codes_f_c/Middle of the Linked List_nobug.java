The bug in the provided code is that it incorrectly calculates the middle node of a linked list. In the loop `for (int i = 0; i < mid; i++)`, the code should iterate `mid` times to reach the middle node. However, the loop condition is `< mid`, which causes the loop to stop one node before reaching the middle. To fix this bug, the loop condition should be changed to `<= mid` to ensure that the loop iterates `mid` times.

Additionally, the `ListNode` class is not provided, so it needs to be defined in order to compile and test the code. Let's assume the `ListNode` class is as follows:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}
```

Taking all of this into consideration, here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode temp = head;
        int size = 0;
        while (temp != null) {
            size++;
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        
        int mid = size / 2;
        temp = head;
        for (int i = 0; i <= mid; i++) {
            temp = temp.next;
        }

        return temp;
    }
}
```

Note: Before running this code, please make sure to define the `ListNode` class as mentioned above.
