Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: Reviewing the provided code, we can see that there are no syntax errors or exceptions thrown. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code has a logical error. The logic issue is with the `flip` method. The method expects the `map` object to contain all the indices that have been flipped. However, when `flip` is called multiple times, the `map` object is not cleared before each call, leading to incorrect behavior.

Fix: To fix the logical error, we need to modify the `reset` method to clear the `map` object before each call to `flip`.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 45 ms (Top 62.26%) | Memory: 50.7 MB (Top 63.21%)
// Swap Tail Element Solution
// 1. Get a random number between [0, size-1]
// 2. size - 1
// 3. Get the index in map by the random map
// 4. Update the flipped element with the tail element.
// Time complexity: O(1) to init, flip, and reset
// Space complexity: O(K), where K is the times of flip calls.
class Solution {
    private final int M, N, CAPACITY;
    private int size;
    private Random random;
    private Map<Integer, Integer> map;

    public Solution(int m, int n) {
        M = m;
        N = n;
        CAPACITY = m * n;
        size = CAPACITY;
        random = new Random();
        map = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public int[] flip() {
        if (size < 0) return new int[] {- 1, - 1}; // or throw exception.
        Integer rand = random.nextInt(size);
        size--;
        int idx = map.getOrDefault(rand, rand);
        Integer tail = map.getOrDefault(size, size);
        map.put(rand, tail);
        return new int[] {idx / N, idx % N};
    }

    public void reset() {
        map.clear(); // Clear the map before each call to flip
        size = CAPACITY;
    }
}
