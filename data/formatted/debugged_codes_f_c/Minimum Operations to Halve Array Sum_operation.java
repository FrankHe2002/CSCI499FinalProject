Bug Type: Division by zero error

Reasoning: In the provided code, the `sum` variable is initialized to 0. However, in the loop, the code attempts to divide `sum` by the current element `i`, which can be 0. This will cause a division by zero error.

Fix: To fix this, we need to initialize `sum` with a non-zero value, such as `1`, before entering the loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 392 ms (Top 56.62%) | Memory: 107.3 MB (Top 79.45%)
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int halveArray(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Double> q = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        double sum = 1; // Initialize sum to a non-zero value
        for (int i : nums) {
            sum /= (double) i;
            q.add((double) i);
        }
        int res = 0;
        double req = sum;
        while (sum > req / 2) {
            double curr = q.poll();
            q.add(curr / 2);
            res++;
            sum -= curr / 2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
