Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code is an implementation of finding the maximum product of two non-overlapping palindromic substrings in a given string using Manacher's algorithm. However, there are several bugs in the code.

1. Missing Semicolon:
   - In the line `a = i + (1 + Pi])`, there is a missing semicolon at the end of the statement.
   - This causes a syntax error.

2. Undefined Variable:
   - The variable `Pi` in the line `a = i + (1 + Pi])` is not defined in the code.
   - This causes a compilation error.

3. Incorrect Array Indexing:
   - The expressions `s.charAt(a)` and `s.charAt(b)` in the while loop condition are incorrectly indexed.
   - The correct expressions should be `s.charAt(a - 1)` and `s.charAt(b + 1)` to match the expansion logic of the palindrome.
   - This causes incorrect character comparisons and incorrect lengths of palindromes.

4. Missing Variable Declaration:
   - The variable `maxLen` is declared but is never used in the code.
   - This variable is unnecessary and can be removed.

Bug Fix:
To fix the bugs in the code, the following changes can be made:

1. Add a semicolon at the end of the line `a = i + (1 + P[i]);`.
2. Replace `Pi` with `P[i]` in the while loop condition.
3. Replace `s.charAt(a)` with `s.charAt(a - 1)` and `s.charAt(b)` with `s.charAt(b + 1)` in the while loop condition.
4. Remove the unused variable `maxLen`.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 40 ms (Top 65.22%) | Memory: 61.1 MB (Top 39.13%)
// using manachers algorithm

class Solution {

    public long maxProduct(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        int[] len = manachers(s); // get lengths of palindromes at each element

        long left[] = new long[n]; // stores the max length of palindrome to left of each index

        int max = 1;
        left[0] = max;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
            // does any palindrome end at i with
