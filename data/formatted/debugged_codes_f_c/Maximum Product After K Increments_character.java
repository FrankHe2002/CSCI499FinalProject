Bug Type: Syntax Error, Logic Error

Reasoning:
- The code has a syntax error in the while loop condition. The negation operator (`!`) is missing before `pq.isEmpty()`.
- The code also has a logic error in the way it computes the product. It adds 1 to each element before multiplying them, which is incorrect.

Fix:
- Add the negation operator (`!`) before `pq.isEmpty()` in the while loop condition.
- Change the way the product is calculated by multiplying the elements directly, without adding 1.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumProduct(int[] nums, int k) {

        Queue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int num : nums) pq.add(num);

        while (k-- > 0) {
            int top = pq.poll();
            pq.add(top);
        }

        long res = 1;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            res = (res * pq.poll()) % 1000000007;
        }

        return (int) (res);
    }
}
```
