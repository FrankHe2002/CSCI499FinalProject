The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition `i > n - 1`. The condition is incorrect because it causes the loop to never execute since `i` starts with the value of 0 and is checked to be greater than `n - 1`, resulting in a false condition.

To fix the bug, we need to change the loop condition to `i < n - 1` to make the loop iterate `n - 1` times.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String generateTheString(int n) {
        String s = "";
        String string = "a";
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
            s += string;
        if (n % 2 == 0)
            return s + "b";
        return s + "a";
    }
}
```
