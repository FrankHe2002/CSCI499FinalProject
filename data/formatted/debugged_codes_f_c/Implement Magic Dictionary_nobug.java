Bug Type in Buggy Code: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The buggy code is for a Magic Dictionary implementation where the `search` method is checking if any word in the dictionary matches the given search word by allowing at most one character difference. 

However, the bug occurs in the `match` method. The method correctly checks if the lengths of the two words are equal. If not, it returns `false`. But the bug is that it should be checking if the difference is exactly `expectedDiff`, not greater than `expectedDiff`. 

Additionally, the implementation of the `MagicDictionary` class itself is correct, and there are no syntax errors or other bugs in the provided code.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the condition should be `if (diff != expectedDiff)` instead of `if (diff > expectedDiff)`. This change ensures that the method checks if the difference is exactly equal to `expectedDiff` and returns `false` if not.

Fixed Code:
```java
class MagicDictionary {
    private String[] dictionary;

    public MagicDictionary() {
    }

    public void buildDict(String[] dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = dictionary;
    }

    public boolean search(String searchWord) {
        for (String dictWord : this.dictionary) {
            if (this.match(searchWord, dictWord, 1))
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    private boolean match(String s, String t, int expectedDiff) {
        if (s.length() != t.length())
            return false;

        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != t.charAt(i))
                diff++;
            if (diff != expectedDiff)
                return false;
        }

        return diff == expectedDiff;
    }
}
```
