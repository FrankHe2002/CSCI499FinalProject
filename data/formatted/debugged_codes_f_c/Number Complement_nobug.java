Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
The given code calculates the complement of a given number by iterating through its binary representation. However, the logic for calculating the complement is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

In the given code, whenever the current bit (i) is 0, it adds 2 raised to the power of x to the sum. However, this logic is opposite to what is required for finding the complement. The correct logic should be to add 2 raised to the power of x whenever the current bit is 1.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic inside the if statement. Instead of adding 2 raised to the power of x when i is 0, we should add it when i is 1.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int x = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            int i = num % 2;
            if (i == 1) {
                sum += Math.pow(2, x);
            } 
            x++;
            num /= 2;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
