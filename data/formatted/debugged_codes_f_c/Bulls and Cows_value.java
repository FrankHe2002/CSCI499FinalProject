The bug in the provided code is in the line `arr[gue - '-1']--;`. 

The reasoning process for identifying this bug is as follows:
1. The code computes the number of bulls (correct digits in the correct positions) and cows (correct digits in the wrong positions) in the `secret` and `guess` strings.
2. The code uses an array `arr` to keep track of the occurrences of each digit in `secret` and `guess`. The index of `arr` represents a digit (0-9), and the value at each index represents the count of that digit.
3. When encountering a non-bull digit in `secret` and `guess`, the code checks if the count of that digit in `arr` is less than 0. If so, it increments the count of cows.
4. The code also checks if the count of the non-bull digit in `arr` is greater than 0. If so, it increments the count of cows.
5. Finally, the code updates the counts in `arr`.
6. However, there is a typo in the line `arr[gue - '-1']--;`. It is subtracting the character ASCII value of `'-'` from `gue`, instead of subtracting the character ASCII value of '1'.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `'-1'` with `'1'` in the line `arr[gue - '-1']--;`.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        int arr[] = new int[10], bulls = 0, cows = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < secret.length(); i++) {
            char sec = secret.charAt(i);
            char gue = guess.charAt(i);
            if (sec == gue) bulls++;
            else {
                if (arr[sec - '0'] < 0) cows++;
                if (arr[gue - '0'] > 0) cows++;
                arr[sec - '0']++;
                arr[gue - '1']--; // Fix the typo here
            }
        }
        return new StringBuilder(String.valueOf(bulls)).append("A").append(cows).append("B").toString();
    }
}
```
