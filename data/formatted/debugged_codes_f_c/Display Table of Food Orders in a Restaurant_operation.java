Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code is an implementation of the `displayTable` method that takes a list of orders and generates a table displaying the frequency of each item ordered at each table. The buggy code has several issues:

1. The code initializes the `head` list with the column headers, starting with "Table". However, the column headers should be sorted in lexicographical order based on the item names.
2. The code uses `head.contains(s.get(2))` to check if an item is already in the `head` list. This check is inefficient since it has a time complexity of O(n) for each insertion, making the overall time complexity of the code O(n^2). Instead, we can use a set to store the item names, enabling efficient O(1) containment checks.
3. In the loop that processes the orders, the code directly accesses the `head` list to check if an item is already present. This is incorrect because the items should be sorted according to their lexicographical order. Instead of accessing `head`, we need to use the sorted `arr` array, starting from index 1.
4. In the loop that generates the table rows, the code checks if an item is present in the current table's map using `m.containsKey(arr[i])`. If the item is present, it adds the corresponding count to the row. However, the code erroneously multiplies the count by an empty string instead of converting it to a string using `String.valueOf()`.
5. The code prints the entire `map` using `System.out.print(map)`, which is unnecessary and should be removed.

To fix the issues, we need to make the following changes:
1. Sort the `head` list using `Collections.sort(head.subList(1, head.size()))` to ensure the items are sorted lexicographically.
2. Replace the usage of `head.contains(s.get(2))` with a set to check if an item is already in the column headers.
3. Replace the usage of `head` with the sorted `arr` array, starting from index 1, to access item names.
4. Replace `l.add(m.get(arr[i]) * "")` with `l.add(String.valueOf(m.get(arr[i])))` to correctly convert the count to a string.
5. Remove the unnecessary `System.out.print(map)` statement.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> displayTable(List<List<String>> orders
