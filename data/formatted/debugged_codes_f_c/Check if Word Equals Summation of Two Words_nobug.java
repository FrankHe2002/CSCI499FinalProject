Buggy Code Explanation:

The bug in the provided code is the incorrect order of operations when calculating the sums of the words. In each loop, after adding the value of the current character (`c - 'a'`) to the sum, the code multiplies the sum by 10. This is done before adding the value of the next character.

For example, consider the word "abc":
1. In the first iteration of the loop, the sum for "abc" is calculated as follows:
   - sumfirst = 0 + ('a' - 'a') = 0
   - sumfirst *= 10 = 0 (incorrectly multiplied by 10)
2. In the second iteration of the loop:
   - sumfirst = 0 + ('b' - 'a') = 1
   - sumfirst *= 10 = 10
3. In the third iteration of the loop:
   - sumfirst = 10 + ('c' - 'a') = 12
   - sumfirst *= 10 = 120

So, instead of correctly adding the values of the characters, the code is multiplying the partial sum by 10, resulting in incorrect sums for each word.

To fix this bug, the multiplication by 10 should be done after adding the value of each character to the sum.

Bug Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSumEqual(String firstWord, String secondWord, String targetWord) {
        int sumfirst = 0, sumsecond = 0, sumtarget = 0;
        for (char c : firstWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumfirst = (sumfirst * 10) + (c - 'a');
        }
        for (char c : secondWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumsecond = (sumsecond * 10) + (c - 'a');
        }
        for (char c : targetWord.toCharArray()) {
            sumtarget = (sumtarget * 10) + (c - 'a');
        }

        return (sumfirst + sumsecond) == sumtarget;
    }
}
```
