The bug type in the provided code is a logical error. The `minTimeToType` method incorrectly calculates the total time by adding the length of the word to the differences between consecutive characters. However, the correct calculation should involve comparing each character with the corresponding key on a circular keyboard.

To fix the bug, we need to calculate the correct difference between two characters based on their positions on the circular keyboard. If the absolute difference is greater than half the number of keys (26/2 = 13), we should subtract it from the total time instead of adding it.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToType(String word) {
        char prevChar = 'a';
        int totalTime = word.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char currChar = word.charAt(i);
            int diff = Math.abs(currChar - prevChar);
            if (diff > 13) {
                diff = 26 - diff;
            }
            totalTime += diff;
            prevChar = currChar;
        }

        return totalTime;
    }
}
```
