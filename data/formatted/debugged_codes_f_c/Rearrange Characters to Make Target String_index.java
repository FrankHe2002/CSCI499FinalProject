Bug type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The provided buggy code has a syntax error due to the following lines:
```
int[] freq = new int[Top], freq2 = new int[26];
```
The variable `Top` is not declared or defined anywhere in the code. It seems that `Top` was used as a placeholder and was intended to be replaced with a valid value.

Fix: Replace `Top` with the correct value. In this case, it should be replaced with `26` to match the size of the `freq` array.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.0%) | Memory: 41.04 MB (Top 6.2%)

class Solution {
    public int rearrangeCharacters(String s, String target) {
        int[] freq = new int[26], freq2 = new int[26];
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray())
            freq[ch - 'a']++;
        for (char ch : target.toCharArray())
            freq2[ch - 'a']++;

        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (char ch : target.toCharArray())
            min = Math.min(min, freq[ch - 'a'] / freq2[ch - 'a']);

        return min;
    }
}
```
