The given buggy code appears to be implementing a function called `isEvenOddTree` that checks whether a binary tree follows a specific pattern of even and odd values at alternating levels. 

Upon reviewing the code, the following bugs are identified:

1. Line 15: `TreeNode rem = qu.remove);` - There is a closing parenthesis `)` missing after `qu.remove`. This will result in a syntax error.
2. Line 19: `if (even) { ... }` - The condition inside this if statement checks if the value at an even level is even or not strictly increasing. However, the requirements state that at even levels, the values should be odd and strictly increasing.
3. Line 23: `if (rem.val % 2 != 0 || rem.val >= prev) { ... }` - The condition inside this if statement checks if the value at an odd level is odd or not strictly decreasing. However, the requirements state that at odd levels, the values should be even and strictly decreasing.

To fix these bugs, the following changes should be made:

1. Add a closing parenthesis `)` after `qu.remove` on line 15.
2. Change the condition inside the if statement on line 19 to check for odd and strictly increasing values.
3. Change the condition inside the if statement on line 23 to check for even and strictly decreasing values.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isEvenOddTree(TreeNode root) {
        Queue<TreeNode> qu = new LinkedList<>();
        qu.add(root);
        boolean even = true; // maintain check for levels
        while (qu.size() > 0) {
            int size = qu.size();
            int prev = (even) ? 0 : Integer.MAX_VALUE; // start prev with 0 to check strictly increasing and Integer_MAX_VALUE to check strictly decreasing
            while (size-- > 0) {
                TreeNode rem = qu.remove();
                if (even) {
                    if (rem.val % 2 != 0 || rem.val <= prev) { // false if value at even level is odd or not strictly increasing
                        return false;
                    }
                } else {
                    if (rem.val % 2 == 0 || rem.val >= prev) {// false if value at odd level is even or not strictly decreasing
                        return false;
                    }
                }
                if (rem.left != null) {
                    qu.add(rem.left);
                }
                if (rem.right != null
