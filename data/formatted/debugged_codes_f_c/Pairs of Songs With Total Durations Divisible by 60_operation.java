Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning: The buggy code uses an array `hm` to store the frequency of remainders obtained when dividing each element in the `time` array by 60. The code calculates the complement of each remainder by subtracting it from 60 (`60 - time[i]`) and checks if the complement exists in `hm`. However, the `hm` array has a size of 61, which doesn't match the expected range of remainders (0-59). This causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to access invalid indices.

Fix: 
1. Increase the size of the `hm` array to 60 to store the frequency of remainders from 0 to 59.
2. Change the code that calculates the complement of each remainder to `(60 - time[i]) % 60` to obtain a valid index within the range of the `hm` array.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int[] hm = new int[60];
        int n = time.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            time[i] = time[i] % 60;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (hm[(60 - time[i]) % 60] != 0)
                res = res + hm[(60 - time[i]) % 60];
            if (time[i] == 0)
                hm[60 % 60] += 1;
            else
                hm[time[i] % 60] += 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
