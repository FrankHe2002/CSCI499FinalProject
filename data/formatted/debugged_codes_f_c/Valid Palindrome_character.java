The bug in the provided code is in the logic of checking for a palindrome. The code incorrectly sets the boolean variable `bool` to `true` whenever a character matches, and only returns `false` if there is a mismatch. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't account for cases where the characters don't match.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize the `bool` variable to `true` before the loop starts. Inside the loop, if we encounter a mismatch, we immediately set `bool` to `false` and exit the loop. This way, we can correctly determine if the string is a palindrome.

Additionally, there are a couple of other issues in the code:
1. There is a commented out line `//s=s.toLowerCase()`, which suggests that there was an intention to convert the string to lowercase. We should uncomment this line to ensure case-insensitive comparison.
2. There is unnecessary checking for strings of length 0 or 1. Since the for loop will not execute in those cases, we can remove these checks.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        s = s.trim().toLowerCase();
        String a = "";
        boolean bool = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if ((s.charAt(i) >= 'a' && s.charAt(i) <= 'z') || (s.charAt(i) >= '0' && s.charAt(i) <= '9')) {
                a = a + s.charAt(i);
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length() / 2; i++) {
            if (a.charAt(i) != a.charAt(a.length() - i - 1)) {
                bool = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        return bool;
    }
}
```

The fixed code correctly checks for palindromes and includes the required fixes.
