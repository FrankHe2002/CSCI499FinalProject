Bug Type: Indexing bug.

Reasoning: 

1. The code initializes the `pieces` array with a size of 100 to store the counts of domino pieces.
2. The loop in the `numEquivDominoPairs` method correctly calculates the index to increment in the `pieces` array based on the min-max value of each domino piece.
3. However, the loop to calculate the number of equivalent domino pairs starts from index 11 and goes up to 99. Since the `pieces` array has a size of 100, the loop index exceeds the valid range of the array. This will cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when accessing the `pieces` array at index 99.

Fix:

To fix the bug, the loop condition should be `i < 99` instead of `i <= 99` to ensure the loop iterates within the valid range of the `pieces` array.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    /**
     * Algorithm
     * 1. Brute force cannot be used because of the set size.
     * 2. Traverse the dominos and group & count them by min-max value.
     * As pieces can be from 1 to 9, means their groups will be from 11 to 99.
     * eg: [1,2] will be the same as [2,1]. Their value is 10 * (min(1,2)) + max(1,2)
     * => 10 * 1 + 2 = 12.
     * so pieces[12]++;
     * 3. After finishing traversing, iterate over the counted pieces and if the count is
     * > 1, calculate the combinations of X by 2.
     * 4. The formula is n!/ (k! * (n-k)!)
     * As n! can be very large, use the short version of it; (n * (n-1)) / 2. EG n= 40
     * Eg:  40!         simplify this(divide by 38!) 39 * 40
     * --------                                  ---------
     * 2! * (38!)                                   2
     * 5. Return the total result
