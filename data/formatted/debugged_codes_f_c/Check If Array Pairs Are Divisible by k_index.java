Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Missing semicolon

Reasoning: 
- In the provided code, there are two bugs: an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and a Missing semicolon bug.
- The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs because the `frequency` array has a length of 1, but the code tries to access elements beyond its bounds.
- The Missing semicolon bug occurs at the end of the statement inside the loop. A semicolon is missing, causing a compilation error.

Fix:
- To fix the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException bug, the `frequency` array should have a length of `k` instead of 1.
- To fix the Missing semicolon bug, a semicolon `;` should be added at the end of the statement inside the loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 78.2%) | Memory: 60.02 MB (Top 5.2%)

class Solution {
    public boolean canArrange(int[] arr, int k) {
        int[] frequency = new int[k];
        for (int num : arr) {
            num %= k;
            if (num < 0) num += k;
            frequency[num]++;
        }
        if (frequency[0] % 2 != 0) return false;

        for (int i = 1; i <= k / 2; i++)
            if (frequency[i] != frequency[k - i]) return false;

        return true;
    }
}
