Bug Type: Logic Error

Explanation: 
The provided code aims to find the number of elements in `arr1` that have a distance greater than `d` from all elements in `arr2`. However, the logic of the code is incorrect. The code mistakenly decreases `x` by 1 whenever it finds an element in `arr1` that is within distance `d` of any element in `arr2`. This logic would only work if the goal was to find the number of elements in `arr1` that are *not* within distance `d` of any element in `arr2`. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the code. Instead of decrementing `x` when a close element is found, we should only increment `x` when an element in `arr1` is more than `d` units away from all elements in `arr2`. This way, `x` will represent the count of such elements.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 68.55%) | Memory: 44.9 MB (Top 25.67-)
class Solution {
    public int findTheDistanceValue(int[] arr1, int[] arr2, int d) {
        int x = 0;
        for (int i : arr1) {
            boolean withinDistance = false;
            for (int j : arr2) {
                if (Math.abs(i - j) <= d) {
                    withinDistance = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!withinDistance) {
                x++;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```
