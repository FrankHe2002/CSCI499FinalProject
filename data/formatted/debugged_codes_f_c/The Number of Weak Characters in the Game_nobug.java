Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation:
The logic in the provided code is incorrect. It tries to find the weak characters based on their properties, specifically their attack and defense values. However, the condition used in the code `if (point[1] < maxH[point[0] + 1])` does not accurately capture the definition of weak characters.

To fix the bug, we need to determine weak characters correctly based on their attack and defense values. A character is considered weak if its attack value is less than the maximum attack value of any other character with a strictly greater defense value. In other words, for a given character with attack `A` and defense `D`, if there exists a character with attack `B` and defense `C` such that `B > A` and `C > D`, then the given character is weak.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the last loop of the code. We need to compare the attack and defense values of each character with the maximum attack value at a higher defense value. If the attack value is less, we increment the count.

In the fixed code, we iterate over each character in the properties array. We check if there is any other character with a higher defense value (`maxH[point[0] + 1]`) and a higher attack value (`point[1]`) than the current character. If such a character exists, we increment the count.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfWeakCharacters(int[][] properties) {
        int[] maxH = new int[100002];
        int count = 0;
        for (int[] point : properties) {
            maxH[point[0]] = Math.max(point[1], maxH[point[0]]);
        }
        for (int i = 100000; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxH[i] = Math.max(maxH[i + 1], maxH[i]);
        }

        for (int[] point : properties) {
            if (point[1] < maxH[point[0] + 1] && point[0] < 100001) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
