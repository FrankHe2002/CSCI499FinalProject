Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning: 
The code attempts to access indices beyond the bounds of the `dp` array in the second for loop. When `i` becomes equal to `k + maxPts`, it executes `dp[i]`, which is out of the valid range of indices for the `dp` array. This results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix: 
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the loop condition of the second for loop. Instead of checking `i <= n`, we should check `i < k + maxPts && i <= n`. This ensures that `i` remains within the valid range of indices for the `dp` array.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
        double[] dp = new double[k + maxPts];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= maxPts; j++) {
                dp[i + j] += dp[i] * 1.0 / maxPts;
            }
        }

        double ans = 0;
        for (int i = k; i < k + maxPts && i <= n; i++) {
            ans += dp[i];
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
