Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning: 
The provided code attempts to determine the reflection pattern of a ray of light in a square room with dimensions `p` x `p`. The bug occurs in the while loop condition `(p % 2 == 0 && q % 2 != 0)`. 

The bug can be identified by considering the possible combinations of `p` and `q`, assuming a scenario where `(p, q) = (2, 1)`:
- Initially, `p` is even and `q` is odd, satisfying the loop condition.
- Inside the loop, `p` and `q` are shifted right by one bit (`p >>= 1` and `q >>= 1`), resulting in `(p, q) = (1, 0)`.
- After the shift, `p` becomes odd and `q` becomes even, causing the loop condition to fail.
- The loop breaks, and the final calculation is `1 - p % 2 + q % 2 = 1 - 1 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0`.

In this scenario, the expected result should be 2 (the ray reflects off the top wall). However, the bug causes the code to return 0, a incorrect result.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the while loop condition should check that both `p` and `q` are odd, rather than `q` being odd and `p` being even. The fixed code changes the loop condition to `(p % 2 != 0 && q % 2 != 0)`.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        while (p % 2 != 0 && q % 2 != 0) {
            p >>= 1;
            q >>= 1;
        }
        return 1 - p % 2 + q % 2;
    }
}
```
