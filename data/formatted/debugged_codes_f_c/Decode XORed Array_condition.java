The bug in the provided code is a logic error in the loop condition. The loop should iterate only up to `encoded.length - 1` because array indices start from 0. However, the current condition is `i <= encoded.length`, which results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to access `encoded[i]` at the last iteration.

To fix this bug, the loop condition should be changed to `i < encoded.length`. This ensures that the loop iterates within the valid range of indices.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] decode(int[] encoded, int first) {
        int[] ans = new int[encoded.length + 1];
        ans[0] = first;
        for (int i = 0; i < encoded.length; i++) {
            ans[i + 1] = ans[i] ^ encoded[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
