Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the logical error lies in the `put` method and the `updateFreq` method. The `put` method is responsible for adding a new key-value pair to the cache, while the `updateFreq` method is responsible for updating the frequency of a node in the cache. The logical error occurs when the frequency is being updated and the minFreq value is not being properly adjusted.

Fix:
To fix the logical error in the code, the minFreq value needs to be updated correctly during the `updateFreq` method. The correct approach is to check if the node's frequency is equal to the current minFreq value and the size of the list with that frequency is 0. If it is, then increment the minFreq value by 1.

Additionally, there is a missing semicolon at the end of the `put` method before the closing brace.

Fixed Code:
```java
class LFUCache {
    // Declare Node class for Doubly Linked List 
    class Node {
        int key, value, freq;// to store key,value and frequency
        Node prev, next;// Next and Previous Pointers

        Node(int k, int v) {
            // initializing in constructor
            key = k;
            value = v;
            freq = 1;
        }

    }

    // Declare class for List of Doubly Linked List
    class List {
        int size;
        Node head, tail;

        List() {
            // initializing in constructor
            size = 0;
            head = new Node(- 1, - 1);// Default values
            tail = new Node(- 1, - 1);
            head.next = tail;
            tail.prev = head;
        }

        // To insert at the start of the list
        void ins(Node newNode) {
            Node temp = head.next;
            head.next = newNode;
            newNode.prev = head;
            newNode.next = temp;
            temp.prev = newNode;
            size++;

        }

        // To delete specific node
        void del(Node newNode) {
            Node pr = newNode.prev;
            Node nx = newNode.next;
            pr.next = nx;
            nx.prev = pr;
            size--;
        }
    }

    Map<Integer, Node> mp;// to store key and Node
    Map<Integer, List> listMap;// to store frequency and Doubly Linked List
    int maxSize, minFreq, curr
