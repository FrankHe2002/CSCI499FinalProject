Bug type: Logical error.

Reasoning process: 

1. The code is attempting to find the largest integer by dividing the given number into its digits and then reassembling them while prioritizing odd digits in ascending order and even digits in ascending order.
2. However, there is a logical error in the code.
3. In the second while loop, the condition `while (num >= 0)` should be `while (num > 0)`, as the loop should continue until all digits are processed. The current condition allows for an additional iteration when `num` becomes 0, which is unnecessary.
4. Additionally, the code should handle the case when there are no odd or even digits left in the priority queues. In such cases, the code should handle the null values from `opq.poll()` or `epq.poll()`.
5. The use of `StringBuilder` to assemble the digits is correct.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int largestInteger(int num) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> opq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> epq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int bnum = num;
        while (num > 0) {
            int cur = num % 10;
            if (cur % 2 == 1) {
                opq.add(cur);
            } else {
                epq.add(cur);
            }
            num /= 10;
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        num = bnum;
        while (num > 0) {
            int cur = num % 10;
            if (cur % 2 == 1) {
                if (opq.isEmpty())
                    sb.insert(0, "0");
                else
                    sb.insert(0, opq.poll());
            } else {
                if (epq.isEmpty())
                    sb.insert(0, "0");
                else
                    sb.insert(0, epq.poll());
            }
            num /= 10;
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(sb.toString());
    }
}
