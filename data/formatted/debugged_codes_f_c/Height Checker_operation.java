Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The code is trying to count the number of positions where the given array `heights` is not sorted in ascending order. It does this by creating a duplicate array `dupheights` and sorting it. Then, it compares each element of `heights` with the corresponding element in `dupheights` and increments `count` if they are not equal.

However, the logic error occurs because the duplicate array `dupheights` is created using `Arrays.copyOfRange`, which creates a new array with the same values but in a different reference. This means that the sorting operation on `dupheights` does not affect the original `heights` array. As a result, the comparison between the two arrays will always return `true`, leading to an incorrect count.

Fix:

To fix this bug, we need to create a true copy of the `heights` array instead of just copying the range. The `Arrays.copyOf` method can be used for this purpose. After creating the duplicate array, we can sort it, compare each element with the corresponding element in `heights`, and increment `count` if they are not equal.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {

        int[] dupheights = Arrays.copyOf(heights, heights.length);

        Arrays.sort(dupheights);
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            if (heights[i] != dupheights[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
