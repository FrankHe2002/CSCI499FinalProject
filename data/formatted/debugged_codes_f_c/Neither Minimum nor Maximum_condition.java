Bug Type: Incorrect Condition Check

Reasoning:
The provided code aims to find the second non-minimum or non-maximum element from the given array. However, the implementation has a bug in the condition check. The code incorrectly returns -1 if the length of the array is greater than or equal to 3 instead of if the length is less than 3.

Fix:
Change the condition check in the line `if (n >= 3)` to `if (n < 3)`. This will correctly return -1 only when the length of the array is less than 3.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findNonMinOrMax(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < 3) return -1;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums[1];
    }
}
```
