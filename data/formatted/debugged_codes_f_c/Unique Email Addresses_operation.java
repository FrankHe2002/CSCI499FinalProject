Bug Type: String Manipulation

Reasoning:
1. The code is aimed at identifying the number of unique email addresses in an array of email strings.
2. It uses a `Set` to store the unique email addresses.
3. The bug is in the email address processing loop.
4. The loop iterates through each character in the email string.
5. If the character is a dot (`'.'`), it is skipped.
6. If the character is a plus sign (`'+'`), all characters after it until the `'@'` symbol should be ignored.
7. If the character is the `'@'` symbol, the remaining part of the email string should be appended to the current email name.
8. If none of the above conditions are met, the character should be appended to the current email name unless we are currently ignoring characters.
9. The bug is that when the `'@'` symbol is encountered, the incorrect substring is appended to the email name.
10. The substring should start from the current index (`i`) plus 1 to exclude the `'@'` symbol. However, the current implementation includes the `'@'` symbol in the appended substring.
11. Therefore, the bug causes incorrect email names to be added to the `Set`, leading to incorrect results.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the substring should start from `i + 1`. Additionally, the loop condition should be `i < email.length()` instead of `i = email.length()` to prevent unnecessary iterations. Finally, the `ignore` flag should be reset to `false` after encountering the `'@'` symbol to ensure that subsequent characters are appended to the email name.

            boolean ignore = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < email.length(); i++) {
                char c = email.charAt(i);
                switch (c) {
                    case '.':
                        break;
                    case '+':
                        ignore = true;
                        break;
                    case '@':
                        name.append(email.substring(i + 1));
                        ignore = false;
                        i = email.length();
                        break;
