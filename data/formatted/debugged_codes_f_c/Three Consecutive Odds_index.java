Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning: The index on line 5 is accessed without checking if it is within the bounds of the array. The loop iterates from 0 to `n`, and on each iteration, it checks if the next element in the array is odd. However, on the last iteration, when `i` is equal to `n-1`, accessing `arr[i + 1]` goes out of bounds since `i + 1` is equal to `n`.

Fix: Modify the loop condition to `i < n - 1` to ensure that the last element is not accessed. Also, check if the count is equal to 2 instead of 3 to correctly identify the presence of three consecutive odds.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        int count = 0, n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if ((arr[i + 1] & 1) > 0) {
                count++;
                if (count == 2) return true;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
