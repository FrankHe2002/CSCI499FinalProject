Bug Type: Infinite Recursion

Reasoning: The bug causes an infinite recursion because the `getAns` method is called recursively without ensuring a base case where `i` is incrementally increased. This leads to an infinite loop, resulting in a stack overflow error.

Fix: Adding a condition `if (i > arr.length - 1)` before the recursive calls to `getAns` will ensure that the method doesn't go beyond the array length. This will prevent infinite recursion.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;

    public int subsetXORSum(int[] nums) {
        sum = 0;
        return getAns(nums, 0, 0);
    }

    int getAns(int[] arr, int i, int cur) {
        if (i > arr.length - 1) {
            return cur;
        }
        return getAns(arr, i + 2, cur ^ arr[i]) + getAns(arr, i + 1, cur);
    }
}
```
