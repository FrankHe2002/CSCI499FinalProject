The bug in the provided code is in the initialization of the `dp` array. The dimensions of the array are incorrect, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. 

The `dp` array has dimensions `[N][2][k + 1]`, where `N` is the length of the `prices` array, `2` represents whether the stock is bought or sold, and `k + 1` represents the number of transactions. However, the initialization loop iterates from `0` to `N - 1`, which exceeds the valid index range.

To fix this bug, we need to change the dimensions of the `dp` array to `[N + 1][2][k + 1]` to include an extra index for initialization. Additionally, we need to update the initialization loop to iterate from `0` to `N` to correctly initialize the entire array.

Other than that, the logic of the code appears to be correct.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int transaction = k;
        int N = prices.length;
        int[][][] dp = new int[N + 1][2][k + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
                for (int tran = 0; tran <= k; tran++) {
                    dp[i][j][tran] = - 1;
                }
            }
        }//init dp
        return profit(0, 1, k, prices, dp);
    }

    int profit(int index, int buy, int transaction, int[] prices, int[][][] dp) {
        if (transaction == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (index == prices.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (dp[index][buy][transaction] != - 1) {
            return dp[index][buy][transaction];
        }
        int profit = 0;
        if (buy != 1) {
            profit = Math.max(- prices[index] + profit(index + 1, 0, transaction, prices, dp),
                    0 + profit(index + 1, 1, transaction, prices, dp));
        } else {
            profit = Math.max(prices[index] + profit(index + 1, 1, transaction - 1, prices, dp),
