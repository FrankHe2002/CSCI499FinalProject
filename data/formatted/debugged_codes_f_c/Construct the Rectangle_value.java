Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The loop iterates through possible widths (`w`) of a rectangle such that `w * w <= area`.
2. If `area` is divisible by `w` (i.e., `area % w == 0`), the corresponding length (`l`) is calculated as `area / w`.
3. After calculating the difference between `l` and `w` (`diff = l - w`), the code checks if the current difference is less than the minimum difference (`diff < minDiff`).
4. If the current difference is less than the minimum difference, the code updates the result array with the current length and width, and updates the minimum difference (`result[1] = l; result[1] = w; minDiff = diff;`).

Bug: 
The bug is in the line `result[1] = w;` inside the if statement. It should update `result[0]` with the current width value instead of `result[1]`.

Fix: 
Change `result[1] = w;` to `result[0] = w;` inside the if statement.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] result = new int[2];

        for (int w = 1; w * w <= area; w++) {
            if (area % w == 0) {
                int l = area / w;
                int diff = l - w;
                if (diff < minDiff) {
                    result[1] = l;
                    result[0] = w;
                    minDiff = diff;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
