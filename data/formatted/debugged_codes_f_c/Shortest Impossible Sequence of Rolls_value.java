Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is that it increments the `len` variable by 1 after every time `set.size() == k` condition is met. However, this is incorrect because the `len` variable should only be incremented if the current sequence is shorter than the previously found shortest sequence. Additionally, the `len` variable is initially set to 2, assuming that the shortest sequence would always be of length 2, which is also incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to keep track of the shortest sequence length found so far and update the `len` variable only if the current sequence length is smaller than the previously found shortest length.

Additionally, the initial value of `len` should be set to a large number, such as `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, to ensure that any valid sequence length found becomes the new shortest length.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestSequence(int[] rolls, int k) {
        int len = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : rolls) {
            set.add(i);
            if (set.size() == k) {
                set = new HashSet<>();
                len = Math.min(len, k);
            }
        }
        return len + 1;
    }
}
```
