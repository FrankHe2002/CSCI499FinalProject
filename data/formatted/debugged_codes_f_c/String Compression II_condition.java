Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The provided code contains a missing semicolon at line 11. It is missing a semicolon after `result += c`. This is a clear syntax error, as Java requires each statement to end with a semicolon. Adding a semicolon at the end of the line will fix the error.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++)
            result += c;
        return result;
    }
}
```
