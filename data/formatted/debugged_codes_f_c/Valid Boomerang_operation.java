Bug Type: Mathematical Operation Error

Reasoning: The mathematical operation `%` is used incorrectly in the computation of the `area` variable. The `%` operator is used for modulus (remainder) calculation, not for dividing by a constant. 

Fix: Replace the `%` operator with the multiplication operator `*` in the computation of `area`. 

Fixed Code:
```java

class Solution {
    public boolean isBoomerang(int[][] points) {
        double a, b, c, d, area;
        a = points[0][0] - points[1][0];
        b = points[1][0] - points[2][0];
        c = points[0][1] - points[1][1];
        d = points[1][1] - points[2][1];
        area = 0.5 * ((a * d) - (b * c));
        return area != 0;
    }
}
