Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code is a solution to a problem that aims to determine the number of modifications required to make a password strong. However, the code contains a bug that may lead to incorrect results.

The bug is in the first loop inside the `strongPasswordChecker` method:
```java
for (int i = 0; i <= repeats.size() && over > 0; i++) {
    int repeat = repeats.get(i);
    if (repeat >= 3 && repeat % 3 == 0) {
        repeats.set(i, repeat - 1);
        over--;
    }
}
```
Here, the loop condition `i <= repeats.size()` should be `i < repeats.size()`. The current condition allows accessing an index out of bounds during the last iteration of the loop, as `repeats.get(i)` attempts to access an index equal to `repeats.size()`. This bug leads to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Additionally, there is a similar issue in the second loop inside the `strongPasswordChecker` method:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < repeats.size() && over > 0; i++) {
    int repeat = repeats.get(i);
    if (repeat >= 3 && repeat % 3 == 1) {
        repeats.set(i, repeat - Math.min(over, 2));
        over -= Math.min(over, 2);
    }
}
```
The loop condition `i < repeats.size()` is correct, but there is a missing closing parenthesis in the statement `repeats.set(i, repeat - Math.min(over, 2))`.

Bug fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the loop conditions and add the missing closing parenthesis in the second loop. Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    private static final int MIN_LENGTH = 6;
    private static final int MAX_LENGTH = 20;

    public int strongPasswordChecker(String password) {
        int numMissingComponents = getNumberOfMissingComponents(password);
        int n = password.length();

        if (n < MIN_LENGTH) {
            return Math.max(numMissingComponents, MIN_LENGTH - n);
        }

        List<Integer> repeats = buildRepeatList(password);

        int over = Math.max(0, n - MAX_LENGTH);
        int numRemoval = over;

        // use overage for repeat % 3 == 0 case. One removal would reduce one replacement
        for (int i = 0; i
