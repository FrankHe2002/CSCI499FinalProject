Buggy Code Explanation:

The buggy code is attempting to implement the "Count and Say" sequence, but it has multiple issues.

1. The method `countAndSay` is misspelled as `countAndSey`.
2. The base case of the recursion in the `countSay` method is incorrect. It should return `mapper[1]` instead of `mapper[n]`.
3. The code is using an incorrect index for accessing previous values in the `mapper` array. It should use `n - 1` instead of `n`.
4. The code has incorrect logic for counting and saying the sequence. It mixes up the counting and saying steps.
5. The code has redundant condition checks and unnecessary string conversions.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public String countSay(int n, String[] mapper) {
        if (n == 1) return mapper[1];
        else {
            String say = "";
            if (mapper[n - 1] != null) say += mapper[n - 1];
            else say += countSay(n - 1, mapper);
            String count = "";
            char cache = say.charAt(0);
            int cntr = 1;
            
            for (int i = 1; i < say.length(); i++) {
                if (cache != say.charAt(i)) {
                    count += cntr + Character.toString(cache);
                    cache = say.charAt(i);
                    cntr = 1;
                } else {
                    cntr++;
                }
            }
            count += cntr + Character.toString(cache);
            
            mapper[n] = count;
            return mapper[n];
        }
    }

    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        String[] mapper = new String[n + 1];
        mapper[1] = "1";
        return countSay(n, mapper);
    }
}
```

The fixes made to the code are as follows:

1. Renamed the method `countAndSey` to `countAndSay`.
2. Changed the base case in the `countSay` method to return `mapper[1]` instead of `mapper[n]`.
3. Fixed the index used to access previous values in the `mapper` array by using `n - 1` instead of `n`.
4. Modified the logic for counting and saying the sequence by using a `char` cache variable, iterating through the `say` string, and counting the consecutive characters.
5. Removed redundant condition checks and unnecessary string conversions.
