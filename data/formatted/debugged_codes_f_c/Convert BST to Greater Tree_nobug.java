Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code is for a method `convertBST` that is supposed to take a binary search tree (BST) as input and convert it into a greater sum tree. However, there are several bugs in the code that prevent it from functioning correctly.

1. `helperNodesVales` Method:
   - In this method, the values of the nodes in the BST are supposed to be added to the `nodesValues` list in a pre-order traversal.
   - However, there is an unnecessary check `if (root == null) { return; }` at the end of the method. This check is not needed because it will never be reached if `root` is not null, and it prevents the correct traversal of the tree.
   - The fix is to remove the unnecessary check `if (root == null) { return; }` from the method.

2. `traverseAndAdd` Method:
   - In this method, the values of the nodes in the `nodesValues` list should be added to the current node's value if they are greater.
   - However, the code mistakenly checks if `nodesValues.get(i) > rootVal` but does not actually perform the addition.
   - The fix is to add `root.val += nodesValues.get(i);` inside the if condition to perform the addition correctly.
   - Additionally, there is also an unnecessary check `if (root == null) { return; }` at the end of the method, which should be removed.

3. Returning the Modified BST:
   - The code currently returns the original `root` without actually modifying it. The modifications for converting the BST into a greater sum tree are not being applied. In order to fix this, the code needs to create a separate method to perform the conversion and then return the modified `root`.

Additionally, there are some inconsistencies in the naming conventions used in the code. The class name `Solution` is unrelated to the problem, and method names like `helperNodesVales` and `traverseAndAdd` have misspelled words. These naming issues can be fixed for better code readability.

Fixed Code:

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            List<Integer> nodesValues = new ArrayList<>();
            addAllValues(root, nodesValues);
