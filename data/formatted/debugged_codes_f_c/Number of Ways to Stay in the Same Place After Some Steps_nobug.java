Bug Type: Missing Bracket

Reasoning: The provided code is missing a closing bracket for the `repeatChar` method. The code currently ends with `result += c`, which is not a complete statement. Adding a closing bracket after this line will correct the syntax error.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
            result += c;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
