The bug in the provided code is with the initialization of `localMaxRight`. It should be initialized to `L + nums[L]`, not just `0`. This is because `localMaxRight` should represent the maximum index that can be reached from the current range (`L` to `R`). Since `L` is the current index and `nums[L]` represents the number of steps that can be taken from that index, `L + nums[L]` gives the maximum index that can be reached. 

Additionally, the loop condition should be `i <= R`, not `i <= R`. This is because we want to iterate over all the elements within the current range (`L` to `R`), and `R` is inclusive.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 82.01% | Memory: 50 MB (Top 21.41%)
class Solution {

    public int jump(int[] nums) {

        int result = 0;

        int L = 0;
        int R = 0;

        while (R < nums.length - 1) {

            int localMaxRight = L + nums[L];

            for (int i = L; i <= R; i++) {

                localMaxRight = Math.max(i + nums[i], localMaxRight);
            }

            L = R + 1;
            R = localMaxRight;
            result++;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
