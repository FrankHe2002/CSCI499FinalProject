Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code has an extra closing brace (`}`) after the inner for loop. This causes a syntax error because there is no matching opening brace for it.
2. The semicolon (`;`) at the end of the inner for loop indicates that the loop has finished executing. Therefore, the subsequent lines of code (`return c;`) are unreachable and should be removed.

To fix the code:
- Remove the extra closing brace (`}`) after the inner for loop.
- Remove the semicolon (`;`) at the end of the inner for loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countTriples(int n) {
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                int sq = (i * i) + (j * j);
                int r = (int) Math.sqrt(sq);
                if (r * r == sq && r <= n)
                    c += 2;
            }
        return c;
    }
}
```
