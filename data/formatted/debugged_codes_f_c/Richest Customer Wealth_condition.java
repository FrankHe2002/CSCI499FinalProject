Bug Type: Logical Error and Syntax Error

Reasoning: 
1. The logical error is that the outer `for` loop condition is `i > accounts.length`, which causes the loop to never execute because the condition is initially false (0 is not greater than `accounts.length`). This results in the method returning the initial value of `res` (0).
2. The syntax error is a missing semicolon (`;`) at the end of the outer `for` loop declaration.

Fix:
1. Change the outer `for` loop condition to `i < accounts.length`, ensuring the loop iterates over the valid indices of the `accounts` array.
2. Add a semicolon at the end of the outer `for` loop declaration to correct the syntax error.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 56.03%) | Memory: 43.3 MB (Top 46.87%)
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int temp = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                temp += accounts[i][j];
            }
            res = Math.max(res, temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
