Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The provided code for the `encode` and `decode` methods simply returns the input strings without performing any actual encoding or decoding. This implies that the provided methods are not functioning as intended and do not provide any functionality for URL encoding or decoding.

Fix:
To fix this bug and provide actual encoding and decoding functionality, we can use a well-known encoding algorithm such as Base64 encoding. We can utilize the `java.util.Base64` class to encode and decode the URLs.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Base64;

public class Codec {

    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    public String encode(String longUrl) {
        String encodedUrl = Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString(longUrl.getBytes());
        return encodedUrl;
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    public String decode(String shortUrl) {
        byte[] decodedBytes = Base64.getUrlDecoder().decode(shortUrl);
        String decodedUrl = new String(decodedBytes);
        return decodedUrl;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
In the fixed code, the `encode` method uses `Base64.getUrlEncoder()` to get an instance of `Base64.Encoder` and calls its `encodeToString` method to encode the `longUrl`. The resulting encoded URL is returned.

The `decode` method uses `Base64.getUrlDecoder()` to get an instance of `Base64.Decoder`. It then calls its `decode` method with the `shortUrl` parameter, which is an encoded URL. The resulting byte array is converted to a string using the `String` constructor, and the decoded URL is returned.
