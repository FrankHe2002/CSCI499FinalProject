The bug in the provided code is in the conditions for counting the number of changes required when the string starts with either 0 or 1. 

Bug type: Logical error

Explanation: 
1. The first condition `(i % 2 != 0 && s.charAt(i) == '0') || (i % 2 != 0 && s.charAt(i) == '1')` checks if the character at index `i` is '0' or '1' when `i` is odd. However, this condition is incorrect because it's checking the same condition twice. It should be checking if the character at index `i` is '0' when `i` is odd and '1' when `i` is even. 
2. Similarly, the second condition `(i % 2 == 0 && s.charAt(i) == '1') || (i % 2 != 0 && s.charAt(i) == '0')` checks if the character at index `i` is '1' or '0' when `i` is even or odd, respectively. However, this condition is also incorrect. It should be checking if the character at index `i` is '0' when `i` is even and '1' when `i` is odd.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 86.00%) | Memory: 41.7 MB (Top 99.33%)
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String s) {
        int count0 = 0; // changes required when the string starts from 0
        int count1 = 0; // changes required when the string starts from 1

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

            // string starts with 1 => all chars at even places should be 1 and that at odd places should be 0
            if ((i % 2 != 0 && s.charAt(i) == '0') || (i % 2 == 0 && s.charAt(i) == '1'))
                count1++;

            // string starts with 0 => all chars at even places should be 0 and that at odd places should be 1
            else if ((i % 2 == 0 && s.charAt(i) == '0') || (i % 2 != 0 && s.charAt(i) == '1'))
                count0++;
        }

        // return minimum of the
