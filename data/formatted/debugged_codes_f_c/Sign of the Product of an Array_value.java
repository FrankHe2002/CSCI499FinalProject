Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: In the code, the `signFunc` method is implemented incorrectly. It checks if `x` is greater than 1 to return 1, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be if `x` is greater than 0 to return 1. Additionally, the else if condition is not necessary, as it should simply return 1 for any value greater than 0. 

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int arraySign(int[] nums) {
        int prod = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int val = signFunc(nums[i]);
            prod *= val;
        }
        return prod;
    }

    private int signFunc(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return -1;
        else if (x > 0) return 1;
        return 0;
    }
}
```
