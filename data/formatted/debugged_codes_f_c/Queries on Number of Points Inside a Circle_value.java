The bug in the provided code is in the `countPoints` method. The loop condition `p < points.length` is incorrect since `points.length` represents the number of rows in the `points` array, but we need to iterate over the number of columns instead. To fix this bug, we need to change the loop condition to `p < points[0].length` to iterate over the number of columns in the `points` array.

Additionally, the code uses a missing method `radius2(point, queries[i])` to calculate the distance between two points. To fix this bug, we need to replace `radius2(point, queries[i])` with `radius2(point, queries[i].slice(0, 2))` to calculate the distance between `point` and `query[i][0]` and `query[i][1]`.

Finally, the code refers to the `Math.sqrt()` method to calculate the square root of `radius2`, but since we only need to compare distances, we can compare `radius2` directly without calculating the square root.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 42.1 MB (Top 96.08%)

class Solution {
    public int[] countPoints(int[][] points, int[][] queries) {
        int len = queries.length;
        int[] ans = new int[len];

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            int radius2 = queries[i][2] * queries[i][2];
            for (int p = 0; p < points[0].length; p++) {
                int[] point = points[p];
                if (radius2(point, queries[i].slice(0, 2)) <= radius2) {
                    count += 1;
                }
            }
            ans[i] = count;
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private int radius2(int[] point, int[] center) {
        int x = point[0] - center[0];
        int y = point[1] - center[1];
        return x * x + y * y;
    }
}
