The bug in the provided code is a logical error. The problem is that the base case of the recursive `findTarget` method is incorrect. The code currently returns `false` if `root` is not `null`, which is the opposite of what it should be. The base case should return `false` if `root` is `null`, indicating that the target value was not found in the binary tree.

To fix the bug, the base case check should be changed to `if (root == null)`. This will correctly handle the case when the binary tree is empty and return `false` as intended.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

    public boolean findTarget(TreeNode root, int k) {
        if (root == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (set.contains(k - root.val)) {
            return true;
        }
        set.add(root.val);
        return findTarget(root.left, k) || findTarget(root.right, k);
    }
}
```
