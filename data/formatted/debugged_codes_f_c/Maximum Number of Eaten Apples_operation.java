Bug Type: Compilation error and logical error.

Reasoning:
1. There is a compilation error in the line `PriorityQueue<Apple> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<Apple>((a, b)%>(a.validDay - b.validDay));` due to the incorrect syntax of the lambda expression. The correct syntax for the lambda expression should be `(a, b) -> a.validDay - b.validDay`.
2. The loop condition `apple.validDay >= currentDay` is incorrect and does not correctly handle expired apples. The correct condition should be `apple.validDay > currentDay`, as apples with a valid day equal to the current day should not be eaten.

Fix:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int eatenApples(int[] apples, int[] days) {
        PriorityQueue<Apple> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<Apple>((a, b) -> a.validDay - b.validDay);

        //start from day 1
        int currentDay = 1;
        int eatenAppleCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < apples.length; i++) {

            //add apple count and their valid day
            if (apples[i] > 0 && days[i] > 0) {

                //current day is included
                int validDay = currentDay + days[i] - 1;

                minHeap.add(new Apple(apples[i], validDay));
            }


            //check for eatable apple
            while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
                //get that apple, with minimum valid date (going to expiry soon)
                Apple apple = minHeap.peek();

                if (apple.validDay > currentDay) {
                    break;
                }

                //remove the apple as it is eaten
                apple = minHeap.remove();
                //eat 1 apple
                apple.count--;

                //increment count
                eatenAppleCount++;

                //add remaining apple, if not gonna expire current day
                if (apple.count > 0 && apple.validDay > currentDay) {
                    minHeap.add(apple);
                }
            }

            //move to the next day
            currentDay++;
        }


        //eat stored apple
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            Apple apple = minHeap.peek();

            if (apple.validDay > currentDay) {
                break;
            }

            //remove the apple as it is eaten
            apple = minHeap.remove();
            //eat 1 apple
            apple
