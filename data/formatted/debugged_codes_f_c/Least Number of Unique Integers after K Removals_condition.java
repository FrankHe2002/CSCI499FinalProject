Buggy Code Reasoning:
The provided buggy code is a method called `findLeastNumOfUniqueInts` that takes an integer array `arr` and an integer `k` as parameters and is expected to return the number of unique integers in `arr` after removing `k` elements. The code uses a frequency map (`freqMap`) to store the frequency of each integer in `arr` and a priority queue (`pq`) to store the unique integers sorted by their frequencies.

Upon inspection, we can identify the following bug in the code:

Bug:
The condition of the while loop in line 10 is `k < 0`, which should have been `k > 0`. This is a logical error because the loop should continue as long as there are elements to be removed (`k > 0`), not when `k` becomes negative. Additionally, the condition for checking if `toBeDeleted` is less than `freqMap.get(element)` is incorrect, as `toBeDeleted` should be greater than or equal to `freqMap.get(element)`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the while loop condition to `k > 0`. Additionally, we need to change the condition for adding back the element to the priority queue to `toBeDeleted <= freqMap.get(element)`.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(int[] arr, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int a : arr) freqMap.put(a, freqMap.getOrDefault(a, 0) + 1);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((i1, i2) -> Integer.compare(freqMap.get(i1), freqMap.get(i2)));
        pq.addAll(freqMap.keySet());
        while (k > 0 && !pq.isEmpty()) {
            int element = pq.poll();
            int toBeDeleted = Math.min(k, freqMap.get(element));
            k -= toBeDeleted;
            if (toBeDeleted < freqMap.get(element))
                pq.add(element);
        }
        return pq.size();
    }
}
```

The fixed code changes the condition `k < 0` to `k > 0` in line 10 and changes the condition for adding back the element in line 16 to `toBeDeleted < freqMap.get(element)`. These changes ensure that the loop continues while there are elements to be removed (`k > 0`) and that an element
