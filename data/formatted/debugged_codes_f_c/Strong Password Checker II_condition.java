Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code attempts to implement a method named `strongPasswordCheckerII` that checks whether a given password meets certain requirements (length of at least 8, contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, at least one number, and at least one special character).

The code has multiple issues:
1. The `HashSet<Integer> intAscii` is intended to store the ASCII values of special characters, but it's incorrectly declared as storing integers. Instead, it should be declared as `HashSet<Character> specialCharacters`.
2. The special characters are stored in a string variable `specialCharacters`, but the variable is not used correctly. Instead of checking for the presence of special characters using `intAscii.contains(ascii)`, the code should check if `specialCharacters` contains `password.charAt(i)`.
3. The conditions to check for uppercase letters (`ascii < 90 && ascii >= 65`) and lowercase letters (`ascii <= 122 && ascii >= 97`) are incorrect. The condition for uppercase letters should use `>= 65` instead of `< 90`, and the condition for lowercase letters should use `>= 97` instead of `<= 122`.
4. The condition to check for a repeated character (`password.charAt(i) == password.charAt(i - 1)`) is incorrect. It only checks if the current character is equal to the previous character, which would classify any repeated character as an invalid password. The condition should check if the current character is equal to both the previous and next characters to ensure that it is surrounded by different characters.

To fix the code, the following changes need to be made:
1. Change `HashSet<Integer> intAscii` to `HashSet<Character> specialCharacters`.
2. Change `intAscii.add(ascii)` to `specialCharacters.add(specialCharacters.charAt(i))`.
3. Change `if (intAscii.contains(ascii))` to `if (specialCharacters.contains(password.charAt(i)))`.
4. Change the conditions for uppercase letters and lowercase letters as mentioned above.
5. Change the condition for checking repeated characters to `if (i > 0 && password.charAt(i) == password.charAt(i - 1) && password.charAt(i) == password.charAt(i + 1))`.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public boolean strongPasswordCheckerII(String password) {
        HashSet<Character> specialCharacters = new HashSet<>();
        String specialChars = "!@#$%^&*()-+";
        for (
