Bug Type: Mathematical Error

Reasoning:
The bug type in the provided buggy code is a mathematical error. 
The code calculates the sum of the elements in the `nums` array and stores it in the `sum` variable. It then calculates the absolute difference between `sum` and `goal` and stores it in the `diff` variable. Finally, it returns the integer division of `diff` by `limit` plus 1 if `diff % limit` is greater than 0.

The bug in the code is that it doesn't correctly handle cases where `diff` is exactly divisible by `limit`. In such cases, it should not add 1 to the result.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the addition of 1 to the result if `diff % limit` is 0. We can modify the code to achieve this by using a conditional statement to check if `diff % limit` is greater than 0. If it is, we add 1 to the result; otherwise, we don't add anything.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 7 ms (Top 11.82%) | Memory: 74.9 MB (Top 84.55%
class Solution {
    public int minElements(int[] nums, int limit, int goal) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums)
            sum += num;
        long diff = Math.abs(sum - goal);
        return (int) (diff / limit) + (diff % limit > 0 ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
```
