Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The bug type in the provided buggy code is a logical error. The bug is in the helper function `help`. 

In the current implementation, when the capital at index `i` is less than or equal to the available capital `w`, the code considers two cases:

1. Include the current profit `profits[i]` and recursively call `help` with updated parameters `k - 1`, `w + profits[i]`, and `i + 1`.
2. Skip the current profit and recursively call `help` with the parameters `k`, `w`, and `i - 1`.

However, the second case has a bug. Instead of decrementing the index `i` by 1, the code decrements it by `-1`, which is incorrect.

Additionally, there is a mistake in the initialization of the `dp` array. The dimensions of the `dp` array should be `profits.length` and not `profits.length + 1`, as indexing starts from 0.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the decrementation of index `i` in the second case of the `help` function should be changed from `i + -1` to `i - 1`.

Furthermore, the initialization of the `dp` array should be changed from `dp = new int[k + 1][profits.length + 1]` to `dp = new int[k + 1][profits.length]`.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    static int[][] dp;

    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        dp = new int[k + 1][profits.length];
        for (int[] row : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, - 1);
        }
        return w + help(k, w, 0, profits, capital);
    }

    public int help(int k, int w, int i, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        if (k == 0 || i >= profits.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (dp[k][i] != - 1) {
            return dp[k][i];
        }
        int res = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        if (capital[i] <= w) {
            res = Math.max(res, Math.max(profits[i] + help(k - 1, w + profits[i], i + 1, profits, capital
