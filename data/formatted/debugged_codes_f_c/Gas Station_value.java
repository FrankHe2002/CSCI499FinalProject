Bug Type: Index Out Of Bounds

Reasoning: The bug is a potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` that can occur when accessing elements of the `gas` and `cost` arrays. The variables `n`, which represents the length of the arrays, are used as the loop condition in the for-loops. However, the loop condition should be `i < n` instead of `i <= n` since arrays in Java are zero-indexed and the valid indices range from 0 to `length - 1`. With the current condition, the loop will access an index out of the array's bounds in both for-loops.

Fix: Change the loop conditions in both for-loops to `i < n`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 62.5 MB (Top 92.09%)
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        // *Upvote will be appreciated*
        int totalFuel = 0;
        int totalCost = 0;
        int n = gas.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalFuel += gas[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += cost[i];
        }
        // if totalfuel < totalCost then It is not possible to travel
        if (totalFuel < totalCost) {
            return -1;
        }

        // It is greater than There may be an Answer
        int start = 0;
        int currFuel = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currFuel += (gas[i] - cost[i]);
            if (currFuel < 0) { // If current Fuel is less than 0, it means we can't start from that index
                start = i + 1; // so we start from the next index
                currFuel = 0;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
