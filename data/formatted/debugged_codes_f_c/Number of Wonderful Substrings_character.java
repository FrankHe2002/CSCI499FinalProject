Bug type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The code has a syntax error on line 28 where there is a missing closing square bracket (`]`) in the expression `count += freq[res;`. This missing closing bracket causes a syntax error because it doesn't properly close the array access.

Fix: Add the missing closing square bracket after `res` in the expression `count += freq[res];`.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long wonderfulSubstrings(String word) {
        int n = word.length();
        long count = 0;

        long[] freq = new long[(1 << 10) + 1]; // Since we have to take only 2^10 possibilies, we can avoid an HashMap

        freq[0] = 1;
        int res = 0; // initialize the frequency of 0000000000 as 1 because when no element is encountered, then the bitmask is 0

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int mask = (1 << (word.charAt(i) - 'a'));
            res ^= mask; // toggling bit of the current character to make it from odd to even OR even to odd
            int chkMask = 1;

            count += freq[res];
            for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {  // Loop for checking all possibilities of different places of the Different Bit
                count += freq[chkMask ^ res];
                chkMask <<= 1;
            }

            freq[res]++; // increasing the frequency of the current bitmask
        }

        return count;
    }
}
