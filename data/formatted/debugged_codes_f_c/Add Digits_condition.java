The bug in the provided code is that it incorrectly handles the case where `num` is divisible by 9. The condition `else if (num % 9 != 0)` should be changed to `else if (num % 9 == 0)` to correctly identify numbers that are divisible by 9. 

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 73.88%) | Memory: 41.9 MB (Top 17.90%)
class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        else if (num % 9 == 0) return 9;
        else return num % 9;
    }
}
```
