Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: The bug type in the provided buggy code is an Array Index Out of Bounds error. In the while loop, the line `char temp = s[end + 2];` attempts to access an index that is out of bounds of the array `s`. The `end` index is already the last index in the array, so adding 2 to it exceeds the array size.

Fix: The fix is to change the line `char temp = s[end + 2];` to `char temp = s[end];` in order to correctly access the value at index `end`. This change ensures that the program doesn't try to access an index that is out of bounds.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.91%) | Memory: 54.3 MB (Top 74.13%)
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int start = 0, end = s.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            char temp = s[end];
            s[end] = s[start];
            s[start] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
