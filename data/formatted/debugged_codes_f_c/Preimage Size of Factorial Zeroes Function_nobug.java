Bug Type: Missing return statement

Reasoning: The `preimageSizeFZF` method is missing a return statement for the case when the `while` loop condition is `true`. This will cause a compilation error. Additionally, the original code does not include the `zeros` method, which is essential for the functionality of the code. Therefore, the missing return statement needs to be added, and the `zeros` method needs to be included or provided separately.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int preimageSizeFZF(int k) {
        long n = 4L * k;
        int resp = 0;
        while (true) {
            int t = zeros(n);
            if (t > k) return 0;
            if (t == k) return 5;
            n++;
        }
        return -1; // Add a default return statement
    }

    private int zeros(long n) {
        int resp = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            resp += (int) (n / 5);
            n /= 5;
        }
        return resp;
    }
}
```
