Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code seems to be attempting to find arithmetic triplets in the given array `nums` with a given difference `diff`.
2. The code initializes an array `map` to keep track of the presence of numbers in `nums`.
3. The code loops through each number in `nums` and updates `map` accordingly.
4. If a number `num` is greater than or equal to 3, the code increments `result` by 1.

The bug in the code is a syntax error in the if condition: `if (map[num >= 3)`. The closing bracket is misplaced, resulting in a syntax error. It should be `if (map[num] >= 3)`.

To fix the bug, the misplaced bracket should be moved after `num]` in the if condition.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 98.25%) | Memory: 42.8 MB (Top 15.70%)

class Solution {
    public int arithmeticTriplets(int[] nums, int diff) {
        int result = 0;
        int[] map = new int[201];

        for (int num : nums) {
            map[num] = 1;

            if (num - diff >= 0) {
                map[num] += map[num - diff];
            }

            if (map[num] >= 3) {
                result += 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
