Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The provided code attempts to remove anagrams from an array of words. The code sorts each word's characters and checks if the sorted word is equal to the previously processed word. If they are not equal, the current word is added to the result list. However, this approach only removes consecutive anagrams and fails to remove anagrams that are not consecutive in the array.

Additionally, the code has a minor issue of not importing the necessary classes (`List`, `ArrayList`, `Arrays`).

Fix:
1. Import the necessary classes (`List`, `ArrayList`, `Arrays`) at the beginning of the code.
2. Initialize the `prev` variable with an empty `String` outside the loop to store the previous sorted word.
3. Create a separate list (`anagramsToRemove`) to store the anagrams that need to be removed.
4. Iterate through each word in the `words` array.
5. Sort the characters of the current word and store it in the `curr` variable.
6. If `curr` is equal to `prev`, it means the current word is an anagram of the previous word. Add the current word to the `anagramsToRemove` list.
7. Update the `prev` variable to store the current sorted word.
8. After the loop, remove all words in the `anagramsToRemove` list from the `li` list.
9. Return the updated `li` list.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public List<String> removeAnagrams(String[] words) {
        String prev = "";
        List<String> li = new ArrayList<>();
        List<String> anagramsToRemove = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            char[] ch = words[i].toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(ch);
            String curr = String.valueOf(ch);
            if (curr.equals(prev)) {
                anagramsToRemove.add(words[i]);
            } else {
                li.add(words[i]);
                prev = curr;
            }
        }
        li.removeAll(anagramsToRemove);
        return li;
    }
}
