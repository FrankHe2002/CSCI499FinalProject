The bug in the provided code is that the variable `min` is initialized with `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, but it is not updated if a valid point is never found. So, if `index` remains as -1 at the end of the loop, it means no valid point was found and the original implementation would return -1, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we can initialize `min` as -1 instead of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This way, if `index` remains as -1, it indicates that no valid point was found. We do not need to add any other changes to the code because the loop and condition for updating `min` and `index` are correct.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int nearestValidPoint(int x, int y, int[][] points) {
        int min = -1, index = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (x == points[i][0] || y == points[i][1]) {
                int d = Math.abs(x - points[i][0]) + Math.abs(y - points[i][1]);
                if (min == -1 || d < min) {
                    min = d;
                    index = i;
                }
            }
        }

        return index;
    }
}
```
