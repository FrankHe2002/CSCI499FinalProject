Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
The provided code has a logical error in the formula for the number of moves required to distribute the coins evenly. The current formula is `left + right + root.val - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct formula should be `left + right + root.val - 2`. This is because each node should have one coin, and any additional coins will require a move to distribute.

Fix:
Change the formula from `left + right + root.val - 1` to `left + right + root.val - 2`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 58.67+) | Memory: 43.1 MB (Top 15.04%)
class Solution {
    int count = 0;

    public int helper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        count += Math.abs(left) + Math.abs(right);
        return (left + right + root.val - 2);
    }

    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return count;
    }
}
```
