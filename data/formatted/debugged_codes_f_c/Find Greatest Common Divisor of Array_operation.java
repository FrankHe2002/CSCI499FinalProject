The bug in the provided code is in the condition `n / result == 0` inside the `if` statement. This condition is incorrect because it checks if the division of `n` by `result` equals to 0, which will always be false since 0 divided by any number is 0. The correct condition should be `n % result == 0`, which checks if `n` is divisible by `result`.

Additionally, the code does not import the necessary package `java.util.Arrays` to use the `Arrays.sort()` method.

Furthermore, the method name `findGCD` suggests finding the greatest common divisor, but the code implementation finds the greatest common factor instead. To align with the method name, the fix is to find the greatest common divisor instead of the greatest common factor.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findGCD(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums[nums.length - 1];
        int result = nums[0];
        while (result > 0) {
            if (nums[0] % result == 0 && n % result == 0) {
                break;
            }
            result--;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
