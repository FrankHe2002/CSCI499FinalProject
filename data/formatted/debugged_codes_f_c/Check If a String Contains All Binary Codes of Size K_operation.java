Bug Type: Indexing Error

Reasoning: In the for loop, the `substring` method is being called with `i - k` as the end index. This is incorrect because it results in accessing a substring that starts before the current index `i`. This will lead to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` since negative indices are not allowed in Java. The correct end index should be `i + k` to include the characters up to `i + k - 1`.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasAllCodes(String s, int k) {
        HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet();
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - k; i++) {
            hs.add(s.substring(i, i + k));
        }
        if (hs.size() == Math.pow(2, k)) return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```
