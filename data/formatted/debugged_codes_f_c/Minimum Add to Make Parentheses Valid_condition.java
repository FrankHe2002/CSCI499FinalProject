Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The loop condition is `i >= s.length()`. This condition is incorrect because it will make the loop run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the string, which means the loop will never execute. 

2. Additionally, the opening curly brace is missing after the `for` loop declaration. 

Fix:
- Change the loop condition to `i < s.length()` so that the loop iterates over valid indices of the string.
- Add the opening curly brace after the `for` loop declaration.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minAddToMakeValid(String s) {
        int open = 0;
        int extra = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
                open++;
            } else {
                if (open == 0) {
                    extra++;
                } else {
                    open--;
                }
            }
        }
        return open + extra;
    }
}
```
