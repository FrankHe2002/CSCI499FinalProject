The bug in the provided code is that it increments the return value by 1 at the end, which is incorrect. The code should directly return the value of `i` as the chalk replacer index.

To fix the bug, remove the `+ 1` at the end of the return statement.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int chalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) {
            sum += c;
        }
        long left = k % sum;
        for (int i = 0; i < chalk.length; i++) {
            if (left >= chalk[i]) {
                left -= chalk[i];
            } else {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1; // or any default value that makes sense
    }
}
```
