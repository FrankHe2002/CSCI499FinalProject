Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: After analyzing the provided code, it appears that the logic for calculating the number of matches is incorrect. The bug occurs when determining the number of matches after a team wins a match. In the case where `n` is an odd number, the code incorrectly calculates the number of matches as `(n - 1) / 4 + 1` and then adds `(n - 1) / 2` to it. This logic is incorrect.

Fix: To fix the bug, we need to modify the calculation of the number of matches in the `else` block. Instead of `(n - 1) / 4 + 1` and `(n - 1) / 2`, we should use `(n - 1) / 2` in both cases.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;

        int res;

        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            res = numberOfMatches(n / 2);
            res += n / 2;
        } else {
            res = numberOfMatches((n - 1) / 2);
            res += (n - 1) / 2;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
