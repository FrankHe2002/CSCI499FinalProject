The bug in the provided code is in the condition `if (nums.length != 1)`. This condition checks if the length of the `nums` array is not equal to 1. If it is not equal to 1, the code returns 0. However, the logic seems incorrect because the code inside the condition should execute when the length of the `nums` array is equal to 1, not when it's not equal to 1.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if (nums.length == 1)`. This will ensure that the code inside the condition executes only when the length of the `nums` array is equal to 1.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 41.38%) | Memory: 50.1 MB (Top 6.90%)

class Solution {
    public int smallestRangeI(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums.length == 1)
            return 0;

        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : nums) {
            min = Math.min(min, num);
            max = Math.max(max, num);
        }
        int diff = max - min;

        return Math.max(0, diff - 2 * k);
    }
}
```
