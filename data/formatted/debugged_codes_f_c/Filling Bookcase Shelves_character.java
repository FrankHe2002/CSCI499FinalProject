The bug type in the provided code is a syntax error (missing semicolon) and a logical error.

Reasoning for identifying and fixing the syntax error:
In the buggy code, there is a missing semicolon at the end of the line `if (curr == books.length) return maxHeight`. Adding a semicolon at the end of the line will fix this syntax error.

Reasoning for identifying and fixing the logical error:
In the buggy code, there is a logical error in the line `currBook[0] <= wRem ? Math.min(maxHeight + findMinHeight(curr + 1, currBook[1], shefWidth - currBook[0]), findMinHeight(curr + 1, Math.max(maxHeight, currBook[1]), wRem - currBook[0])) : maxHeight + findMinHeight(curr + 1, currBook[1], shefWidth - currBook[0])`. The condition `currBook[0] <= wRem` is used to check if the current book width is less than or equal to the remaining shelf width. If it is true, the code should calculate the minimum height either by placing the book on a new shelf or on the same shelf. However, in this line, the same shelf calculation is also performed when the condition is not true. To fix this logical error, we need to split the two cases and use nested ternary operators.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    int[][] books;
    int shefWidth;

    Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();

    public int findMinHeight(int curr, int maxHeight, int wRem) {
        String key = curr + ":" + wRem;

        if (memo.containsKey(key)) return memo.get(key);

        if (curr == books.length) return maxHeight;

        int[] currBook = books[curr];

        int heightNewShelf = maxHeight + findMinHeight(curr + 1, currBook[1], shefWidth - currBook[0]);
        int heightSameShelf = currBook[0] <= wRem ? findMinHeight(curr + 1, Math.max(maxHeight, currBook[1]), wRem - currBook[0]) : Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        int minHeight = Math.min(heightNewShelf, heightSameShelf);
        memo.put(key, minHeight);

        return minHeight;
    }


    public int minHeightShelves(int[][] books, int shelfWidth) {
        this.books = books;
        this.s
