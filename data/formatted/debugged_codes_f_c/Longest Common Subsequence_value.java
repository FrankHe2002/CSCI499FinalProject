Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Explanation: In the provided code, the length of the dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized as `m + 1` for the number of rows and `n + 1` for the number of columns. However, in the nested for loop, the indices used to access `dp` are `i` and `j`, which range from 1 to `m` and 1 to `n` respectively. This will cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` as the indices should be from 0 to `m - 1` and 0 to `n - 1`. 

For example, if `m = 3` and `n = 2`, the `dp` array should have dimensions 4x3. However, in the code, `i` ranges from 1 to 3 and `j` ranges from 1 to 2, resulting in the attempt to access `dp[3][3]` and `dp[3][2]`, which are both out of the valid range.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int m = text1.length();
        int n = text2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
