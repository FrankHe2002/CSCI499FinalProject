Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The provided code is missing a semicolon at line 26, resulting in a syntax error. The missing semicolon causes a compile-time error. Adding a semicolon after `result += c` fixes the syntax error.

Fixed Code:

class Solution {
    public List<String> removeComments(String[] source) {
        boolean blockActive = false; //We keep track of whether or not we are within a block comment with the blockActive variable. 
        //It is initally set to false since we haven't read anything until now.


        List<String> result = new ArrayList<String>();
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();

        //Read every line from the source input. 

        for (String line : source) {
// Each time we move on to reading a new line, we check if it is a part of a block comment. 
//If it is already part of a block comment, it means we should skip the implicit newline characters as mentioned in the problem description. 
//For example if Line 1 was  "int a /*Block comment Started" and Line 2 was "Block comment ends here */ b;", and Line 3 was "int c;" 
//we want our output to be "int ab", "int c" instead of "int a", "b;", "int c;" 
            if (! blockActive) {
                builder = new StringBuilder();
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < line.length(); i++) { //Read every character of line
                char c = line.charAt(i);

                        //If so, then we need to check if the next character makes it a regular comment, a block comment, or neither of those two.

                            //until the end of the line, so we break from the loop and move on to the next line.
