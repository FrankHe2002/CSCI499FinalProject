This buggy code has multiple issues. Here is a step-by-step review and fix of the code:

1. The code is missing a semicolon after the statement `result += c`.
2. There is a logical error in the `multiply` method. It performs addition instead of multiplication. The fix is to change `return a + b;` to `return a * b;`.
3. The `isEven` method incorrectly checks for odd numbers. The fix is changing the condition from `num % 2 == 1` to `num % 2 == 0`, which correctly identifies even numbers.
4. The `isLeapYear` method has an incorrect implementation of the leap year condition. The original condition erroneously includes non-leap years. The correct leap year condition is a year being divisible by 4 and not by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400. The fix adjusts the condition to `(year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)`, correctly identifying leap years.
5. The buggy code has a compilation error in the `distinctSequences` method due to a missing closing parentheses on line 42.
6. There is a typo on line 51, where `for int j = 0; j < 6; j++)` should be corrected to `for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++)`.

Here is the fixed code:

        dp = new long[][]
