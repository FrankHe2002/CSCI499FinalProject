Bug Type: Syntax Error and Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is missing a closing bracket (`]`) on line 7.
2. On line 8, there is a typo in the variable name, `heatersi` instead of `heaters[i]`.
3. The logic for checking if a house is within the range of a heater is incorrect. If a house is within the range, `prevHouseIdx` should be updated to indicate that the house has been covered by a heater. The current implementation incorrectly increments `prevHouseIdx` for each house within the range, leading to incorrect results.
4. The condition `prevHouseIdx >= houses.length - 1` is repeated twice, which is unnecessary.

Fix:
1. Add a closing bracket (`]`) on line 7.
2. Fix the variable name on line 8, changing `heatersi` to `heaters[i]`.
3. Change the logic on lines 11-15 to correctly update `prevHouseIdx` when a house is covered by a heater. This can be done by checking if `houses[j] <= to` and `houses[j] >= from`, and if so, incrementing `prevHouseIdx` and breaking out of the loop.
4. Remove the redundant `if (prevHouseIdx >= houses.length - 1)` statement on line 16.
