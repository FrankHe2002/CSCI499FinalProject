Buggy Code Explanation:
The code has a logical error in the line `return result + 2 >= 3 ? result + 2 : 0;`. The purpose of this line is to ensure that the returned length is at least 3 in order for it to be considered a valid Fibonacci subsequence. However, the current condition `result + 2 >= 3` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. The fixed code should check if `result >= 1` instead.

The bug type in this code is a logical error.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 46 ms (Top 97.5%) | Memory: 54.76 MB (Top 33.3%)

class Solution {
    /*
     * dp[i][j] is the max length of fibbonacci series whose last two elements
     * are A[i] & A[j]
     * for any integer A[k] we need to find two number A[i] & A[j] such that
     * i < j < k and A[i] + A[j] == A[k], we can find such pairs in O(n) time
     * complexity.
     * if there exist i,j,k such that i < j < k and A[i] + A[j] == A[k] then
     * dp[k][j] = dp[i][j] + 1 (A[k], A[j] are last two elements of fibbonacc series)
     */
    public int lenLongestFibSubseq(int[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        int result = 0;
        for (int k = 2; k < n; k++) {
            int i = 0, j = k - 1;
            while (i < j) {
                int sum = A[i] + A[j] - A[k];
                if (sum < 0) {
                    i++;
                } else if (sum > 0) {
                    j--;
                } else {
                    // ith, jth kth element are fibbonaci sequence
                    dp[j][k] = dp[i][j] + 1; // since numbers are unique
                    result = Math.max(result, dp[j][k]);
                    i++;
                    j--;
                }
            }
        }
        return result >= 1 ? result + 2 : 0;
    }
