Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code calculates the cumulative sum of the `cardPoints` array and stores the values in the `totalSum` array.
2. It then iterates from 0 to `k` and calculates the score by subtracting the subsum from the total sum of `cardPoints`.
3. The issue is with the loop condition `i <= k`. The loop should iterate until `i < k` because the index `j` is calculated as `i + n - k - 1`, which would cause an out-of-bounds access when `i` reaches `k`.

Fix:
Change the loop condition from `i <= k` to `i < k`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 20.60+) | Memory: 66.5 MB (Top 16.04%)
class Solution {
    public int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.length;
        int[] totalSum = new int[n];
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += cardPoints[i];
            totalSum[i] = sum;
        }
        if (n == k) {
            return sum;
        }
        int score = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int j = i + n - k - 1;
            int subsum = 0;
            if (i == 0) {
                subsum = totalSum[j];
            } else {
                subsum = totalSum[j] - totalSum[i - 1];
            }

            score = Math.max(score, sum - subsum);
        }
        return score;
    }
}
```
