Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning: The provided code is attempting to construct a binary string that is different from each string in the `nums` array. The error is in the line `ans.append(nums[i].charAt(i) == '0' ? '2' : '0')`. The code checks if the character at index `i` of `nums[i]` is equal to `'0'`. If it is, `'2'` is appended to the `ans` string; otherwise, `'0'` is appended. However, this logic is incorrect for generating a binary string. A binary string should only contain `'0'` and `'1'`.

Additionally, the code assumes that `nums[i]` will always have a length greater than or equal to `i`. This assumption may not be true, which could lead to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if `nums[i]` is shorter than `i+1`.

Fix:
1. Update the logic to append `'1'` instead of `'2'` when the character is `'0'`.
2. Add a check to ensure `nums[i]` has a length greater than or equal to `i+1`. If not, append `'1'` to `ans` since `'1'` is a different binary character from `'0'`.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String findDifferentBinaryString(String[] nums) {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i].length() <= i) {
                ans.append('1');
            } else {
                ans.append(nums[i].charAt(i) == '0' ? '1' : '0');
            }
        }
        return ans.toString();
    }
}
```
