Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The code is intended to calculate the number of possible combinations of rolling `n` dice with `k` faces each to get a target sum. The logic for updating the `dp` array seems correct, as it considers the previous values in the `dp` array to calculate the current value. However, there is a logical error in the initialization of the `dp` array and the nested loops used for iterating through the possible dice rolls.

In the current implementation, the `dp` array is initialized with dimensions `(n + 1) * (n * k + 1)`, which seems incorrect. The outer loop iterates from `2` to `n`, indicating that there are at least two dice being rolled. However, the `n * k + 1` in the dimensions suggests that the maximum possible sum is `n * k`. This discrepancy in array dimensions indicates a logical error in the code.

Additionally, the nested loops for updating the `dp` array iterate from `i` to `i * k` and `j` to `target`, which also seem incorrect. The inner loop's condition of `x <= k` suggests that there are `k` possible faces on a die, but the loop should actually iterate from `1` to `k`, considering all possible values of a single die roll.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the initialization of the `dp` array and the loop conditions for updating it.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 12 ms (Top 94.21%) | Memory: 40.8 MB (Top 96.38%)
class Solution {
    public int numRollsToTarget(int n, int k, int target) {
        if (target < n || target > n * k) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return -1;

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][target + 1];
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k && i <= target; i++) {
            dp[1][i] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= target; j++) {
                for (int x = 1; x <= k && x <= j; x++) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][
