Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 
1. The `StockPrice` class uses two `PriorityQueue` objects, `max` and `min`, to keep track of the maximum and minimum stock prices respectively.
2. The `update` method adds a new `StockRecord` object to both `max` and `min` priority queues.
3. The `maximum` method retrieves the maximum stock price by peeking at the top of the `max` priority queue.
4. Similarly, the `minimum` method retrieves the minimum stock price by peeking at the top of the `min` priority queue.
5. The bug lies in the logic used to retrieve the maximum and minimum stock prices.
6. The current implementation checks if the top record in the priority queue matches the recorded price in the `map`. If they don't match, it means that the current top record has been updated, and it is no longer the maximum or minimum price.
7. However, this logic assumes that each update made to `max` and `min` priority queues will also update the `map`, which is not the case.
8. As a result, the logic used to retrieve the maximum and minimum stock prices may provide incorrect results.

Fix:

The fix involves modifying the `maximum` and `minimum` methods to retrieve the correct maximum and minimum stock prices.

1. In the `maximum` method, the fix is to retrieve the maximum stock price by peeking at the top of the `max` priority queue directly, without any additional logic.
2. Similarly, in the `minimum` method, the fix is to retrieve the minimum stock price by peeking at the top of the `min` priority queue directly, without any additional logic.

```java
class StockPrice {

    PriorityQueue<StockRecord> max = new PriorityQueue<>((sr1, sr2) -> (sr2.price - sr1.price));
    PriorityQueue<StockRecord> min = new PriorityQueue<>((sr1, sr2) -> (sr1.price - sr2.price));
    StockRecord current_record;
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();


    public StockPrice() {
        current_record = new StockRecord();
    }

    public void update(int timestamp, int price) {
        if (timestamp >= current_record.timestamp) {
            current_record.timestamp = timestamp;
            current_record.price = price;
        }

        StockRecord sr = new StockRecord(timestamp, price);
        max.add(sr);
        min.add(sr);
        map
