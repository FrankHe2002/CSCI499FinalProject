The bug in the provided code is an incorrect implementation of the condition to check for overlap between a circle and a rectangle.

There are two main steps to fix the bug:
1. Correct the condition to check for overlap.
2. Ensure the code is formatted properly.

The fix for the bug will include the following changes:
1. Change the condition inside the return statement to correctly check for overlap. The condition should compare the distance squared between the center of the circle and the closest point on the rectangle to the radius squared.
2. Add semicolons at the end of each line to ensure proper syntax.
3. Indent the code properly for better readability.

Fixed Code:
```java

class Solution {
    public boolean checkOverlap(int radius, int xCenter, int yCenter, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        return Math.pow(Math.max(x1, Math.min(x2, xCenter)) - xCenter, 2) +
                Math.pow(Math.max(y1, Math.min(y2, yCenter)) - yCenter, 2) < radius * radius;
    }
}
```
