Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The code intends to calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained from buying and selling stocks. However, the logic for updating the lowest stock price (`lsf`) and calculating the profit (`pist`) is incorrect. 

To fix the bug, we need to update `lsf` when we find a lower stock price (not a higher one) and calculate the profit as the difference between the current price and the updated `lsf`. Additionally, the initial value of `lsf` should be the first price in the array, not `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 93.59%) | Memory: 83.9 MB (Top 46.18%)
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int lsf = prices[0];
        int op = 0;
        int pist = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < lsf) {
                lsf = prices[i];
            }
            pist = prices[i] - lsf;
            if (op < pist) {
                op = pist;
            }
        }
        return op;
    }
}
```
