Bug type: Logical error.

Reasoning: The code is attempting to count the number of ways "010" or "101" can be formed in a given string. The logic used is correct, but there is an error in one of the conditions. In the line `if (oneZero >= 0)`, the condition should be checking `oneZero > 0` instead. This is because if `oneZero` is equal to zero, there are no combinations of "101" that can be formed.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public long numberOfWays(String s) {
        int zero = 0; // Individual zeroes count
        long zeroOne = 0; // Number of combinations of 01s
        int one = 0; // Individual ones count
        long oneZero = 0; // Number of combinations of 10s
        long tot = 0; // Final answer
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '0') {
                zero++;
                if (one > 0)
                    oneZero += one; // Each of the previously found 1s can pair up with the current 0 to form 10
                if (zeroOne > 0)
                    tot += zeroOne; // Each of the previously formed 01 can form a triplet with the current 0 to form 010
            } else {
                one++;
                if (zero > 0)
                    zeroOne += zero; // Each of the previously found 0s can pair to form 01
                if (oneZero > 0)
                    tot += oneZero; // Each of the previously formed 10 can form 101
            }
        }
        return tot;
    }
}
```
