Bug Type: Missing Operation

Reasoning: The bug in the provided code is that there is a missing operation in the line `array[ch / 'a']++;`. It seems that the intention is to increment the value at the corresponding index in the `array` based on the character `ch`. However, dividing `ch` by `'a'` is not a meaningful operation in this context. 

Fix: To fix this bug, we need to calculate the correct index based on the character `ch`. Assuming the characters are all lowercase letters, we can subtract `'a'` from `ch` and use the resulting value as the index. This will map each character to its corresponding index in the `array`. The fix is to change the line `array[ch / 'a']++;` to `array[ch - 'a']++;`.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    private int N = 26;

    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        int[] array = new int[N];
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            array[ch - 'a']++;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : array) {
            if (i == 0) continue;
            while (set.contains(i)) {
                i--;
                ans++;
            }
            if (i != 0) {
                set.add(i);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
