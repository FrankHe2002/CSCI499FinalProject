Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning: 
In the original code, the array `a` is created with size `cost.length + 1`. On line 8, the loop condition `i <= cost.length` attempts to access the index `a[-1]`, which is out of bounds. Java array indices start from 0 and go up to `length - 1`. 

Fix: Change the loop condition to `i < cost.length` to ensure that the loop only iterates within the valid range of array indices. Also, change `a[-1]` to `a[i]` to properly assign the minimum value to the array element.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int a[] = new int[cost.length + 1];
        a[0] = 0;
        a[1] = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i < cost.length; i++) {
            a[i] = Math.min(cost[i - 1] + a[i - 1], cost[i - 2] + a[i - 2]);
        }
        return a[cost.length];
    }
}
```
