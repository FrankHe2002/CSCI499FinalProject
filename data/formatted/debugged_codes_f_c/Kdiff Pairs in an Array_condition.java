Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

The logical error in the code lies in the condition within the second loop. The condition is checking for two scenarios: 

1. If `k` is less than or equal to 0 and there exists an element `i + k` in the map.
2. If `k` is equal to 0 and the value of `i` in the map is greater than 1.

However, the code does not handle the scenario where `k` is greater than 0. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to handle the case where `k` is greater than 0 as well.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 50.6%) | Memory: 43.63 MB (Top 70.1%)

// O(n) Time Solution

class Solution {
    public int findPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        for (int num : nums)
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);

        int result = 0;
        for (int i : map.keySet())
            if ((k < 0 && map.containsKey(i + k)) || (k == 0 && map.get(i) > 1) || (k > 0 && map.containsKey(i + k)))
                result++;
        return result;
    }
}
```
