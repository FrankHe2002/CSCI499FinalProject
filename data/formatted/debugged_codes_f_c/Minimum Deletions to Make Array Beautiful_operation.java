Bug type in the provided code: 
The bug in the provided code is an arithmetic error.

Reasoning process for identifying the bug and fixing it:
1. The initial problem with the code is the condition `newIndex * 2 == 0` which checks if `newIndex` is equal to zero. However, this condition doesn't make sense because multiplying any number by 2 will always give a value that is not zero.
2. Additionally, the `if` condition checks if `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[i+1]`. This condition should actually check if `nums[newIndex]` is equal to `nums[newIndex + 1]`.

Fixed code (minimal changes):
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletion(int[] nums) {
        int deletion = 0, n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ) {
            int newIndex = i - deletion;
            if (newIndex >= 0 && nums[newIndex] == nums[newIndex + 1])
                deletion++;
            else 
                i++;
        }
        return ((n - deletion) % 2 == 0) ? deletion : deletion + 1;
    }
}
```
