Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the bug is related to the logic inside the while loop. The condition `arr[j] != arr[1]` should be `arr[j] != arr[i]`, as it intends to compare the characters at positions `j` and `i`. Additionally, the bug could be due to a typo in the comment `DEACREASING`, which should be changed to `DECREASING`.

Fix:

```java
// Runtime: 13 ms (Top 89.72%) | Memory: 43.2 MB (Top 90.81%)
class Solution {
    public String longestPrefix(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        char arr[] = s.toCharArray();
        int lps[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int j = lps[i - 1]; // COMPARING ITS i WITH ITS PREV ELEMENT
            while (j > 0 && arr[j] != arr[i]) {
                j = lps[j - 1]; // DECREASING TILL WE FIND ITS PREFIX WHICH IS EQUAL TO ITS SUFFIX
            }
            if (arr[j] == arr[i]) {// IF ITS PREV IS SAME AS CURRENT THEN INCREMENT IT
                j++;
            }
            lps[i] = j; // SAVE WHATEVER THE VALUE IS
        }
        int j = lps[n - 1];
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
            sb.append(arr[i]);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
