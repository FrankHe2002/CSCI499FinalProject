The bug in the provided code seems to be in the loop where the `hashMap` is filled. The loop condition and the indexing are incorrect, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Let's analyze the code to understand and fix the bug.

Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning:
1. The `charArray` is created with the same length as `s`.
2. The loop iterates from 0 to the length of `charArray`, which causes the last iteration to access an index out of bounds (`charArray[i + 1]`).
3. In each iteration, the code checks the occurrence of the character at `charArray[i + 1]` in the `hashMap`.
   - If it's the first time (occurrence == null), the character and its occurrence count are added to the `hashMap`.
   - If the character is already present, its occurrence count is incremented.
4. This incorrect iteration and indexing lead to the loop running one more time than intended, causing the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the loop condition and indexing in the loop that fills the `hashMap`.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String reorganizeString(String s) {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder("");
        char[] charArray = new char[s.length()];
        Map<Character, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<CharOccurence> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b.occurence - a.occurence);

        charArray = s.toCharArray();

        for (int i = 0; i < charArray.length; i++) {
            Integer occurence = hashMap.get(charArray[i]);
            if (occurence == null)
                hashMap.put(charArray[i], 1);
            else
                hashMap.put(charArray[i], occurence + 1);
        }
        queue.addAll(hashMap.entrySet()
                .stream()
                .parallel()
                .map(e -> new CharOccurence(e.getKey(), e.getValue()))
                .collect(Collectors.toList()));
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Queue<CharOccurence> tmpQueue = new LinkedList<>();
            int sizeQueue = queue.size();
            int stringLength = ans.length();
            int startSub = (stringLength - 1 < 0) ? 0 : stringLength - 1;
            int endSub = stringLength;
            String lastLetter = ans.substring(startSub, endSub);
            boolean letterAdded =
