Buggy Code Explanation:

The buggy code is attempting to split an array into two sets such that the average of the elements in each set is the same. However, the code contains a recursive method `gen` that is responsible for generating all possible subsets of elements and storing their sums in arrays `a` and `b`. The bug is in the logic of this recursive method.

The `gen` method is supposed to add the sum of a subset of elements to the corresponding set in the `set` array. However, the bug is that the method is missing a base case to stop the recursion. As a result, the recursive calls continue indefinitely, leading to a `StackOverflowError` when the call stack exceeds its limit.

To fix this, we need to add a base case to stop the recursion when the current index `cur` reaches the value `n`. This ensures that the method stops generating subsets and the recursion ends.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public boolean splitArraySameAverage(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length, sum = Arrays.stream(nums).sum();
        Set<Integer>[] a = new HashSet[n / 2 + 1];
        Set<Integer>[] b = new HashSet[n / 2 + 2];
        Arrays.setAll(a, o -> new HashSet<>());
        Arrays.setAll(b, o -> new HashSet<>());
        gen(0, n / 2, 0, 0, nums, a);
        gen(n / 2, n, 0, 0, nums, b);
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) { // i = num of elements selected from A
            for (int j = 0; j < b.length; j++) { // j = num of elements selected from B
                if (i + j > 0 && i + j < n && sum * (i + j) % n == 0) {
                    for (int cur : a[i]) { // do Two Sum
                        if (b[j].contains(sum * (i + j) / n - cur)) {
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private void gen(int cur, int n, int bits, int sum, int[] nums, Set<Integer>[] set) {
        if (cur == n) {
            set[bits].
