Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code has several bugs.

1. `arr` Initialization: In the code snippet `arr[0] = "";`, the index `0` is being used for assignment, but the loop variable `i` is not being used. This means that only the first element of `arr` is being initialized while the rest remain `null`. This will cause a `NullPointerException` when trying to access these uninitialized elements later in the code.

2. `trim` Method: The `trim` method is attempting to trim the trailing whitespaces from the `String`, but it is incorrectly checking the condition `val[len - 1] <= ' '`. This condition will only trim the spaces, but not other whitespace characters like tabs or newlines. Additionally, the `substring` method is used to extract the trimmed part of the `String`, but the `start` index (`st`) is always `0`, which will result in the method returning the original `String` instead of the trimmed version.

3. Missing Line Break: The code is missing a line break before the `trim` method, making it harder to read.

Fixing the Bugs:
1. To fix the `arr` initialization bug, the loop variable `i` should be used to access the relevant index of `arr`. This can be done by replacing `arr[0] = "";` with `arr[i] = "";` in the first loop.

2. To fix the issues with the `trim` method, the condition `val[len - 1] <= ' '` should be replaced with `val[len - 1] <= ' ' || val[len - 1] == '\t' || val[len - 1] == '\n'`, which includes checks for tab and newline characters. Additionally, the start index (`st`) should be updated dynamically as well. These changes can be made as follows:
```java
public String trim(String str) {
    int len = str.length();
    int st = 0;

    char[] val = str.toCharArray();

    while ((st < len) && (val[len - 1] <= ' ' || val[len - 1] == '\t' || val[len - 1] == '\n')) {
        len--;
    }
    return str.substring(st, len);
}
```

3. Lastly, a line break can be added before the `trim` method to improve readability.
