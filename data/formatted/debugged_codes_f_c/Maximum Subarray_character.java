Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the logic for calculating the maximum subarray sum is incorrect. The current implementation is missing the case where all the elements in the array are negative. In such cases, the current `gmax` value, which is initialized with `nums[0]`, will not correctly track the maximum sum. This results in an incorrect output for arrays with all negative elements.

Fix: To fix this issue, we need to update the initialization of `gmax` to the smallest possible value, which is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. This ensures that the maximum sum is correctly tracked even when all the elements are negative.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int currmax = 0;
        int gmax = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // Fix: Initialize gmax with the smallest possible value
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currmax += nums[i];
            gmax = Math.max(gmax, currmax);
            currmax = Math.max(currmax, 0);
        }
        return gmax;
    }
}
```
