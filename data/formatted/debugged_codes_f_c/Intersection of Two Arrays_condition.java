Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The logic for finding the intersection of two arrays is incorrect. The code checks if `dp[i]` is equal to 0, which means that the element `i` is not present in `nums1` and adds it to the `ans` array. However, the intention is to find the common elements between `nums1` and `nums2`. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check if `dp[i]` is greater than 0, indicating that the element `i` is present in both arrays.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.90%) | Memory: 44.3 MB (Top 29.92%)
class Solution {
    public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int[] dp = new int[1000];
        for (int i : nums1) {
            dp[i]++;
        }
        int[] ans = new int[1000];

        //declaring ptr to track ans array index
        int ptr = 0;
        for (int i : nums2) {
            if (dp[i] > 0) {
                dp[i] = 0;
                ans[ptr] = i;
                ptr++;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(ans, 0, ptr);
    }
}
```
