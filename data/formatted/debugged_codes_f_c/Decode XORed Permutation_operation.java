Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition `i <= n` in the first for loop. It should be `i < n` instead because the index of arrays in Java starts from 0 and goes up to `length - 1`. The buggy code causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to accessing an index out of bounds.

Additionally, there seems to be a typo in the second to last line where it says `ans[i * 1]`. It should be `ans[i - 1]` instead, as it intends to access the previous index in the array.

Bug Type:
1. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Due to accessing an array index out of bounds.
2. Typo/Error: Using the incorrect array index in line 49.

Fixing the Bugs:
1. Change the loop condition in the first loop from `i <= n` to `i < n`.
2. Update `ans[i * 1]` on line 49 to `ans[i - 1]`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] decode(int[] encoded) {
        int n = encoded.length + 1, all = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++ i) {//a^b^c^d^e^f^g^h^i
            all ^= i;
        }
        int x = 0;
        for (int v : encoded) {//a^b  b^c  c^d  d^e e^f f^g g^h h^i = a^i
            x ^= v;
        }
        int mid = all ^ x; //a^b^c^d^e^f^g^h^i ^ a^i = b^c^d^e^f^g^h
        for (int i = 1, j = encoded.length - 2; i < j; i += 2, j -= 2) {
            //(b^c^d^e^f^g^h) ^ (b^c ^ g^h ^ d^e ^ e^f) = e
            mid ^= encoded[i] ^ encoded[j];
        }
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        ans[n / 2] = mid;
        //a    b    c    d   e   f   g   h   i
        //a^
