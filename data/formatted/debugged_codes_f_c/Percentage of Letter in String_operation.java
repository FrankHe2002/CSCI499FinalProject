Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
The bug is in the calculation of the percentage. Currently, the code calculates the percentage by taking the remainder of `(100 * count) % n`, which will not give the accurate percentage value. The correct calculation is `(100 * count) / n` to get the percentage as an integer value.

Fix:
To fix the bug, change the calculation of the percentage from `(100 * count) % n` to `(100 * count) / n`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.0%) | Memory: 40.55 MB (Top 34.5%)

class Solution {
    public int percentageLetter(String str, char letter) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = str.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (str.charAt(i) == letter) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        int per = (100 * count) / n;
        return per;
    }
}
```
