The bug in the provided code is in the condition `if (times[4] != '?')`. It should be `if (times[4] == '?')` in order to check if the second character of minute is a question mark. The reasoning process for identifying the bug is comparing the condition with the requirement specified in the comments. 

Additionally, there is a missing semicolon after `times[0] = (times[1] <= '3' || times[1] == '?') ? '2' : '1'`. 

To fix the bug, change the condition from `if (times[4] != '?')` to `if (times[4] == '?')` and add a semicolon after `times[0] = (times[1] <= '3' || times[1] == '?') ? '2' : '1'`.

The final fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public String maximumTime(String time) {
        char[] times = time.toCharArray();
        //for times[0]
        //if both characters of hour is ?, then hour is 23 then times[0] should be '2'("??:3?)".
        //if 2nd character of hour is <= 3, then hour can be in 20s  then times[0] should be '2'.
        //if 2nd character of hour is >3, then hour can only be in 10s  then times[0] should be '1'.
        if (times[0] == '?')
            times[0] = (times[1] <= '3' || times[1] == '?') ? '2' : '1';
        //if 1st character of hour is 0 or 1, then hour can be 09 or 19 then times[1] should be '9'.
        //if 1st character of hour is 2, then hour can be 23 then times[1] should be '3'.
        if (times[1] == '?')
            times[1] = times[0] == '2' ? '3' : '9';
        //if both characters of minute is ? then minute is 59, or only 4th character is ? then 5_ so times[3] is always '5'.
        if (times[3] == '?')
            times[3] = '5';
        //if
