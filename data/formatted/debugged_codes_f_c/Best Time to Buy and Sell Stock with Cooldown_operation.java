Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The buggy code attempts to find the maximum profit from buying and selling stocks based on given prices.
2. The nested loops iterate over the indices of the `dp` array, which represents the maximum profit at each index.
3. Within the loops, the code calculates the profit based on whether the stock is bought (buy = 0) or sold (buy = 1).
4. However, the index initialization and iteration expression in the outer loop are incorrect, causing an infinite loop. `index--` subtracts one from the index, but it should be `index -= 2` since the inner loop needs to access `dp[index + 2]`.
5. Additionally, the condition `n % 1` always evaluates to 0 since `n` is the length of the `prices` array, so the outer loop does not execute.
6. The variable `profit` should be initialized outside the inner loops to avoid unnecessary reinitializations.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 55.13%) | Memory: 42.3 MB (Top 47.48%)
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int n = prices.length;

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 2][2];

        for (int index = n - 1; index >= 0; index -= 2) {
            int profit = 0;

            for (int buy = 0; buy <= 1; buy++) {
                if (buy == 0) { // buy stocks
                    profit = Math.max(- prices[index] + dp[index + 1][1], 0 + dp[index + 1][0]);
                }
                if (buy == 1) { // we can sell stocks
                    profit = Math.max(prices[index] + dp[index + 2][0], 0 + dp[index + 1][1]);
                }
                dp[index][buy] = profit;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
```
