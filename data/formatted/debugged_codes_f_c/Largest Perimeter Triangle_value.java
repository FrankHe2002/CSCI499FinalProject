Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The bug occurs in the condition `nums[i] + nums[i + 1] > nums[i + 1]`, which checks if the sum of two sides is greater than the third side in a triangle. However, this condition is incorrect because it is comparing the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` with `nums[i + 1]` itself, leading to incorrect results. 

Fix: The fix is to check if the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side, which would be `nums[i + 2]`. The condition should be `nums[i] + nums[i + 1] > nums[i + 2]`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 12 ms (Top 44.30%) | Memory: 54.1 MB (Top 55.23%)
class Solution {
    public int largestPerimeter(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        for (int i = nums.length - 3; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[i + 1] > nums[i + 2])
                return nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2];
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
