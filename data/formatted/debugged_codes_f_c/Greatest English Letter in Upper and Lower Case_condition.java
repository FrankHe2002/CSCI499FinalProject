The bug type in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning: 

The code aims to find the greatest letter in a given string. However, the condition `ch < 'A'` in the second for loop is incorrect. This condition will always evaluate to false because the ASCII value of 'Z' is greater than 'A'. As a result, the second for loop will not execute, and the method will always return an empty string.

To fix the bug, the condition in the second for loop should be changed to `ch >= 'A'`, ensuring that the loop iterates in descending order from 'Z' to 'A'.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 6 ms (Top 53.1%) | Memory: 41.50 MB (Top 23.1%)

class Solution {
    public String greatestLetter(String s) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            set.add(ch);
        }

        for (char ch = 'Z'; ch >= 'A'; ch--) {
            if (set.contains(ch) && set.contains((char) ('a' + (ch - 'A')))) {
                return "" + ch;
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
}
