Bug type in the buggy code: Infinite loop.

Reasoning:
1. The loop condition `while (left == right)` is incorrect. It should be `while (left != right)`. The current condition will result in an infinite loop if the initial values of `left` and `right` are the same.
2. The `right <<= count;` statement at the end is incorrect. The intention may be to left shift `right` by `count` bits, but the code is actually left shifting `count` times and then assigning the result to `right`. To fix this, we need to use parentheses to ensure the order of precedence and avoid the shift assignment operator (<<=). 

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left != right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            count++;
        }
        return right << count;
    }
}
```
