The bug in the provided code is a logical error in the `lcm` function. The function incorrectly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

The LCM algorithm used in the original code is incorrect. The algorithm needs to find the LCM by dividing the product of the two numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the code mistakenly calculates the product of the two numbers divided by their GCD, resulting in an incorrect LCM.

To fix this bug, we need to replace the LCM calculation in the `lcm` function with the correct algorithm that calculates the LCM using the GCD.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
        int low = 0, high = 2 * (int) 1e9;

        int ab = lcm(a, b), bc = lcm(b, c), ca = lcm(c, a), abc = lcm(a, bc);

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            int count = mid / a + mid / b + mid / c - mid / ab - mid / bc - mid / ca + mid / abc;
            if (count >= n) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }

    private int lcm(int x, int y) {
        int a = x, b = y;
        while (a != 0) {
            int t = a;
            a = b % a;
            b = t;
        }
        return x * (y / b);
    }
}
```
