Bug Type: Logical Error and Null Pointer Exception

Reasoning Process:
1. The code uses a dummy node to simplify swapping pairs of nodes.
2. The loop iterates over the linked list to swap pairs of nodes.
3. However, there are logical errors and a null pointer exception in the loop condition and assignment statements.
4. The loop condition `(curr == null && curr.next != null)` is incorrect. It should be `(curr != null && curr.next != null)` to avoid a null pointer exception. The loop should continue as long as `curr` is not null and `curr.next` is not null.
5. In the assignment statements, the order of swapping the next nodes is incorrect. It should be `prev.next.next = curr;` followed by `prev.next = curr.next;`.
6. Additionally, the code fails to update the `head` variable after the swaps are completed. The fix is to assign `head` as the new head (`head = dummy.next;`) before returning it.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.8 MB (Top 55.04%)

class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0), prev = dummy, curr = head;
        dummy.next = head;
        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            prev.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
            prev.next.next = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
            prev = prev.next.next;
        }
        head = dummy.next;
        return head;
    }
}
```
