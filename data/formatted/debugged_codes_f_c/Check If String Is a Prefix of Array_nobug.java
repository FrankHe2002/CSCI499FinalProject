Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: In the provided code, the `isPrefixString` method checks if a given string `s` is a concatenation of a prefix of `words[]`. However, the implementation of the logic is incorrect.

The issue is with the logic used to check if `s` is a prefix of the concatenated string. Currently, it checks if `s` is equal to the entire concatenated string (`s.equals(res.toString())`), which is incorrect. It should check if `s` is a prefix of the concatenated string.

Additionally, the code also includes a redundant check `if (s.indexOf(res.toString()) == -1)`. This check is not necessary because if `s` is not equal to the concatenated string, it automatically means that `s` is not a prefix of the concatenated string.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPrefixString(String s, String[] words) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder("");
        for (String word : words) {
            res.append(word);
            if (s.startsWith(res.toString()))
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
