Bug Type: Arithmetic Error

Reasoning: The bug appears to be a syntax error in the formula used to determine if a square on a chessboard is black or white. The calculation `(coordinates.charAt(0) - 'a' / coordinates.charAt(1) - '0')` seems to be incorrect. Additionally, the order of operations seems to be incorrect, as division should not be performed before subtraction.

Fix:
The formula used to determine if a square is white or black on a chessboard is as follows:
- If the letter coordinate is 'a', 'c', 'e', or 'g' and the number coordinate is odd, or if the letter coordinate is 'b', 'd', 'f', or 'h' and the number coordinate is even, then the square is black. Otherwise, the square is white.

Considering this, the fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean squareIsWhite(String coordinates) {
        char letter = coordinates.charAt(0);
        char number = coordinates.charAt(1);
        
        boolean isLetterOdd = (letter - 'a') % 2 == 1;
        boolean isNumberOdd = (number - '0') % 2 == 1;
        
        return (isLetterOdd && isNumberOdd) || (!isLetterOdd && !isNumberOdd);
    }
}
```

The fixed code assigns variables to the letter and number coordinates and calculates whether they are odd or even. The final return statement checks if both the letter and number coordinates are odd or even, indicating a black square, or if they are different (one odd and one even), indicating a white square.
