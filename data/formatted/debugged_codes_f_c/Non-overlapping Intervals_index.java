Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
1. The code aims to count the minimum number of intervals that need to be erased to remove overlaps.
2. The code sorts the intervals in ascending order based on their start times.
3. Then, it iterates over the sorted array of intervals and checks if the current interval overlaps with the previous interval.
4. If they overlap, it increments the `res` counter and updates the `start` and `end` variables accordingly.
5. However, there are a few issues with the code:
  - The initial `start` and `end` values are set incorrectly. They are set to the start and end times of the first interval, but they should be set to the second interval since we need to compare the second interval with the first one.
  - The condition `if (interval[1] >= end) continue;` skips the current iteration if the end time of the previous interval is greater than or equal to the end time of the current interval. This is incorrect because we want to update the `start` and `end` variables even if the end time is greater. We only need to skip the iteration if the start time of the current interval is less than the `end` variable, indicating an overlap.
  - The `interval` variable is assigned to `intervals[i - 1]`, which is the previous interval. This is incorrect, and it should be assigned to `intervals[i]`, which is the current interval being checked.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        int start = intervals[0][0];
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int[] interval = intervals[i];

            if (interval[0] < end) {
                res++;
                if (interval[1] < end) {
                    end = interval[1];
                }
            } else {
                start = interval[0];
                end = interval[1];
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
