Bug Type: Mathematical Error

Reasoning: 
1. The buggy code computes the value of `ans` as `(n * n + n) + 2`.
2. It then calculates the square root of `ans` and stores it in the variable `sq`.
3. The code checks if `sq * sq` is equal to `ans`. If it is, it returns `sq`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
4. However, the computation of `ans` in the buggy code is incorrect. It adds `n` to `n * n` and then adds 2 to the result. This does not align with any specific mathematical operation or logic.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the computation of `ans` so that it aligns with the intended mathematical operation.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int pivotInteger(int n) {
        int ans = n * (n + 1) + 2;
        int sq = (int) Math.sqrt(ans);
        if (sq * sq == ans) return sq;
        else return -1;
    }
}
```
