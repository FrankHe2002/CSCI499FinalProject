Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: 
In the provided buggy code, there is a loop condition `while (counter[j + 2] == 0)` that is responsible for iterating through the `counter` array. However, in some cases, `j + 2` can exceed the valid indices of the `counter` array, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The loop should iterate while `j + 2` is less than the length of the `counter` array.

Fix:
Change the loop condition from `while (counter[j + 2] == 0)` to `while (j + 2 < counter.length)`
