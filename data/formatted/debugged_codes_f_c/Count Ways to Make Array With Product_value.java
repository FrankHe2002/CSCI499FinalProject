Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The provided code does not have any imports or package declarations, so it is assumed to be standalone code. In this case, the actual bug in the provided code is a missing semicolon (`;`) at the end of the line `result += c`.

Fix: Add a semicolon at the end of the line `result += c`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++)
            result += c;
        return result;
    }
}
```
