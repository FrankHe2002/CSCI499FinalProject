Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug lies in the catchTime method. The formula used to calculate the catch time is incorrect. In the original code, the formula used is `(double) dist / v`, where `v` represents the relative velocity between two cars. However, this formula is incorrect for calculating the catch time. The correct formula would be `dist / v`. The casting to `double` is unnecessary since dividing an `int` by another `int` will yield a `double` result.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 40 ms (Top 65.78%) | Memory: 229.1 MB (Top 68.82%)
class Solution {
    public double[] getCollisionTimes(int[][] cars) {
        int n = cars.length;
        double[] res = new double[n];
        Arrays.fill(res, - 1.0);

        Deque<Integer> stack = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int[] c1 = cars[i];
            while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                int j = stack.peekLast();
                int[] c2 = cars[j];

                if (c1[1] > c2[1] && (res[j] == -1.0 || catchTime(cars, i, j) <= res[j])) {
                    res[i] = catchTime(cars, i, j);
                    break;
                }

                stack.pollLast();
            }
            stack.offerLast(i);
        }
        return res;
    }

    private double catchTime(int[][] cars, int i, int j) {
        int dist = cars[j][0] - cars[i][0];
        int v = cars[i][1] - cars[j][1];

        return (double) dist / v;
    }
}
