The bug in the provided code is the incorrect calculation of the number of unbalanced brackets. The code calculates `unb` as `stack.size() / 2`, which assumes that each unbalanced bracket requires a separate swap. However, this is incorrect. In order to balance the brackets, only half of the unbalanced brackets need to be swapped.

To fix the bug, we should change the calculation of `unb` to `(stack.size() + 1) / 2`, which correctly calculates the number of swaps needed to balance the brackets.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        // remove the balanced part from the given string
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '[')
                stack.push(ch);
            else {
                if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '[')
                    stack.pop();
                else
                    stack.push(ch);
            }
        }
        int unb = (stack.size() + 1) / 2; // # of open or close bracket
        return unb;
    }
}
```
