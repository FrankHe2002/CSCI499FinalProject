The bug type in the provided buggy Java code is a logical error.

Bug Explanation:
The logical error in the code is in the for loop condition `for (int i = 1; i >= max; i++) if (findGCD(i)) count++;`. The loop condition `i >= max` is incorrect because it causes the loop to terminate immediately since `1` is not greater than or equal to `max` (which is initially set to `0`). As a result, the loop never executes and the count remains `0`.

Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the loop condition to `i <= max`. This will ensure that the loop iterates from `1` up to `max`, inclusive.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 1084 ms (Top 15.1%) | Memory: 56.26 MB (Top 90.9%)

class Solution {
    int max = 0;
    Set<Integer> exist = new HashSet();

    public int countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(int[] nums) {
        getMax(nums);
        for (int num : nums) exist.add(num);
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= max; i++) if (findGCD(i)) count++;
        return count;
    }

    public void getMax(int[] nums) {
        for (int i : nums) max = Math.max(max, i);
    }

    public int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return (a == 0) ? b : gcd(b % a, a);
    }

    public boolean findGCD(int num) {
        int val = 0;
        for (int i = num; i <= max; i += num)
            if (exist.contains(i)) val = gcd(i, val);
        return (val == num);
    }
}
```
