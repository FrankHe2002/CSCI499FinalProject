The bug in the provided code is a missing opening curly brace `{` after the `while` loop condition. This syntax error causes the code to have an incorrect structure, leading to compilation errors.

To fix this bug, we need to add an opening curly brace `{` after the `while (remain > 1)` loop condition.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int head = 1;
        int remain = n;
        boolean left = true;
        int step = 1;

        while (remain > 1) {
            if (left || remain % 2 == 1) {
                head = head + step;
            }
            remain /= 2;
            step *= 2;
            left = !left;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```
