The bug in the provided code is in the condition `if (cur > prev)`. This condition checks if the current element is greater than the previous element, but it fails to account for the case where the current element is equal to the previous element. In this case, we don't need to add any additional operations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to `if (cur > prev)`, so that we only add the difference `cur - prev` when the current element is strictly greater than the previous element.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
        int res = 0;
        int prev = 0;
        for (int cur : target) {
            if (cur > prev) {
                res += cur - prev;
            }
            prev = cur;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
