The bug in the provided code is that it does not correctly calculate the threshold value `comp` for determining the special integer. The code incorrectly divides the length of the array by 4, assuming that the special integer would appear more than 25% (1/4) of the time. However, this assumption is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to calculate the correct threshold value for the special integer. Since the integer that appears most frequently in the array accounts for more than 25% of the array, we can set the threshold to `arr.length / 4 + 1`.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int findSpecialInteger(int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        int comp = arr.length / 4 + 1; // Correctly calculate the threshold value
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (!hm.containsKey(i)) {
                hm.put(i, 1);
            } else {
                int val = hm.get(i);
                val++;
                hm.put(i, val);
            }
            if (hm.get(i) > comp) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
