Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the logic for finding the intersection node of two linked lists is implemented incorrectly. The code calculates the lengths of both linked lists and then adjusts the starting point of each linked list based on the difference in lengths. However, the adjustment should be made by iterating over the linked lists themselves, not by adjusting the references `tempA` and `tempB` directly. Additionally, the termination condition for the while loop that finds the intersection node is incorrect. It should be `tempA != null && tempB != null`, not just `tempA != null`. Lastly, the code does not handle the case where there is no intersection between the two linked lists.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.75%) | Memory: 55.6 MB (Top 36.20%)
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode tempA = headA, tempB = headB;
        int lenA = 0, lenB = 0;
        while (tempA != null) {
            lenA++;
            tempA = tempA.next;
        }
        while (tempB != null) {
            lenB++;
            tempB = tempB.next;
        }
        tempA = headA;
        tempB = headB;
        if (lenB > lenA) {
            for (int i = 0; i < lenB - lenA; i++) {
                tempB = tempB.next;
            }
        } else if (lenA > lenB) {
            for (int i = 0; i < lenA - lenB; i++) {
                tempA = tempA.next;
            }
        }
        while (tempA != null && tempB != null && tempA != tempB) {
            tempA = tempA.next;
            tempB = tempB.next;
        }
        return tempA;
    }
}
```
