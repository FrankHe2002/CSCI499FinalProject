Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code is a binary search algorithm for solving the arrange coins problem. However, there is a bug in the termination condition of the while loop. It currently checks if `s <= e`, but it should actually check if `s < e`. Additionally, the return statement should be modified to return `(int) s` instead of `(int) e`, as `s` holds the correct value when the while loop terminates.

Bug Type: Termination condition bug

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 44.14%) | Memory: 40.7 MB (Top 83.154%)
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long s = 0;
        long e = n;
        while (s < e) {
            long mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
            long coin = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (coin > n) {
                e = mid - 1;
            } else if (coin < n) {
                s = mid + 1;
            } else return (int) mid;
        }
        return (int) s;
    }
}
```
