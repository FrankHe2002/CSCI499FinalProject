Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The code has a logical error in the loop condition. The condition `left > right` should be `left <= right` to ensure that the loop iterates until `left` and `right` cross each other.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 24 ms (Top 38.47%) | Memory: 65.6 MB (Top 33.01%)
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        int boatCount = 0;
        Arrays.sort(people);

        int left = 0;
        int right = people.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int sum = people[left] + people[right];
            if (sum <= limit) {
                boatCount++;
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                boatCount++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return boatCount;
    }
}
```
