Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code has several issues. Firstly, in the nested for loop, the condition for the inner loop `for (int j = 0; j >= n; j++)` is incorrect. The condition `j >= n` will always be false, so the inner loop will not execute. It should be `j < n` to ensure the loop iterates over the columns of the `grid` array.

Secondly, the calculation for the `column` variable is incorrect. It uses the original column index `j` instead of the updated column index. It should be `(j + k) % n` to calculate the new column index after shifting.

Thirdly, the calculation for the `row` variable is also incorrect. It uses the original row index `i` instead of the updated row index. Additionally, the formula `(i + (j + k) / n) % m` is flawed. It should be `(i + (j + k) / n) % m` to correctly calculate the new row index after shifting.

Finally, the return statement `return (List) Arrays.asList(arr);` converts the 2D array `arr` into a list, but it should return a list of lists. Each row of the 2D array should be converted into a list before adding it to the final list. Additionally, the cast to `(List)` is unnecessary.

To fix these issues:
- Change the inner loop condition to `j < n`.
- Update the calculation for the `column` variable to `(j + k) % n`.
- Update the calculation for the `row` variable to `(i + (j + k) / n) % m`.
- Convert each row of the `arr` 2D array into a list before adding it to the final list.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> shiftGrid(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;  // row
        int n = grid[0].length;  // column

        int[][] arr = new int[m][n];

        k = k % (m * n);

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int column = (j + k) % n;
                int row = (i + (j + k) / n) % m;
                arr
