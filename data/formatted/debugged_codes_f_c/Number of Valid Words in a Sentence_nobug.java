Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
1. The code intends to count the number of valid words in a sentence.
2. The regular expression `regex` is used to validate each word and check if it consists of only lowercase alphabets, optional hyphens, and ends with optional punctuation.
3. The regular expression `r2` is used to check if each word contains no digits.
4. The loop iterates over each word in the sentence and checks if it matches both `regex` and `r2`.
5. If a word matches both conditions, the count `ans` is incremented.

Bug: The bug is that the condition `s.matches(r2)` is redundant and incorrect. It should be removed because it contradicts the intention of counting valid words. Currently, the code only counts words that have no digits, which is not the desired behavior.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countValidWords(String sentence) {
        String regex = "^([a-z]+(-?[a-z]+)?)?(!|\\.|,)?$";
        String[] arr = sentence.split("\\s+");
        int ans = 0;
        for (String s : arr) {
            if (s.matches(regex)) {
                ans++;
                //System.out.println(s);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
