Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning Process: 

The bug in the provided code is a logical error in the implementation of binary search. The midpoint calculation `int mid = ((right - left) / 2) + left;` is incorrect. It should be `int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;` to avoid integer overflow. Dividing `(right - left)` directly may exceed the range of integer values.

The fix for this bug is to update the midpoint calculation to `int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;`. This change properly calculates the midpoint without causing integer overflow and ensures the binary search is performed correctly.

Fixed Code:

```java
/**
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 *
 * @param num your guess
 * @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *          1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *          otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (guess(mid) == 0)
                return mid;
            else if (guess(mid) < 0)
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                left = mid + 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
}
