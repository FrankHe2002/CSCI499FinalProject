Bug Type: Arithmetic/Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the issue lies in the line `temp %= nums[i];`. The modulus operator (`%`) is typically used to calculate the remainder of a division operation. In this case, it seems like the intention was to update the value of `temp` by taking the modulus of `nums[i]`, but this operation doesn't make sense in the context of finding the maximum ascending sum. Additionally, there is no need to use modulus in this scenario.

Fix:
To fix the bug and align with the intention of finding the maximum ascending sum, the operation `temp %= nums[i];` should be replaced with `temp += nums[i];`. This change ensures that the correct calculation is performed to track the running sum of ascending subarrays.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAscendingSum(int[] nums) {
        int res = nums[0], temp = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1])
                temp += nums[i];
            else
                temp = nums[i];
            res = Math.max(res, temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
