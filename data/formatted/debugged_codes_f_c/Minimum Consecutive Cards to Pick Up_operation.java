Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The buggy code is attempting to find the minimum difference in indices between two occurrences of the same card in an array. The logic to calculate this difference is incorrect. The buggy code calculates the difference as `i - map.get(cards[i]) + 1`, which adds 1 to the difference. However, this addition is unnecessary and incorrect. The correct formula should be `i - map.get(cards[i])`.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 51 ms (Top 92.02/) | Memory: 61 MB (Top 90.10%)

class Solution {
    public int minimumCardPickup(int[] cards) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(cards[i]))
                min = Math.min(i - map.get(cards[i]), min); // Check if the difference in indices is smaller than minimum
            map.put(cards[i], i); // Update the last found index of the card
        }
        return min == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : min; // Repetition found or not
    }
}
