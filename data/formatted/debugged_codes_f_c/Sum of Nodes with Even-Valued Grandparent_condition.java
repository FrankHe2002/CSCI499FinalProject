The bug in the provided code is a missing semicolon (`;`) at the end of the statement inside the `dfs` method. Java requires each statement to end with a semicolon.

Additionally, there is a logical error when checking if `grandParent` is even. The condition `grandParent == null && grandParent.val % 2 == 0` should be `grandParent != null && grandParent.val % 2 == 0` to ensure we only consider cases where there is a grandparent node and it has an even value.

To fix the code, we need to add a semicolon at the end of the statement inside the `dfs` method and correct the logical error in the if condition.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;

    public int sumEvenGrandparent(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, null, null);
        return sum;
    }

    void dfs(TreeNode current, TreeNode parent, TreeNode grandParent) {
        if (current == null) return; // base case 
        if (grandParent != null && grandParent.val % 2 == 0) {
            sum += current.val;
        }
        //cur->cur.left ||cur.right , parent=cur,grandPrarent=parent
        dfs(current.left, current, parent);
        dfs(current.right, current, parent);
    }
}
```
