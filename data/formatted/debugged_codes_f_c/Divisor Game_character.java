The bug in the provided code is a missing closing brace (`}`) for the `divisorGame` method. This causes a compilation error. The fix is to add the missing closing brace at the end of the `divisorGame` method.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```
