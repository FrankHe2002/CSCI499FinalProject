Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code is a solution to a problem involving finding the second minimum time to reach the destination node in a graph. However, there are several bugs present in the code:

1. Syntax Error: The line `if ((t / change % 2 != 0) t = (t / change + 1) * change;` is missing a semicolon (;) at the end of the statement. This causes a syntax error.

2. Logical Error: The condition in the line `if (node == n && uniqueVisit[node] == 2) return dis[node];` checks if node is equal to n, but it should check if node is equal to n-1, since the nodes are 1-based.

3. Incorrect Fulfillment of Requirements: The code fails to fulfill the requirements of finding the second minimum time to reach the destination. It only returns the time to reach the destination if the destination node has been visited twice, but it should be finding the second minimum time among all nodes.

Bug Fix:
Here is the fixed code with the identified bugs addressed:

```java
// Runtime: 254 ms (Top 50.50%) | Memory: 51.9 MB (Top 97.03%)
class Solution {
    public int secondMinimum(int n, int[][] edges, int time, int change) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> g = new HashMap();
        for (int[] e : edges) {
            int u = e[0], v = e[1];
            g.computeIfAbsent(u, x -> new ArrayList()).add(v);
            g.computeIfAbsent(v, x -> new ArrayList()).add(u);
        }
        PriorityQueue<int[]> q = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        q.offer(new int[] {1, 0});
        int[] uniqueVisit = new int[n + 1]; // uniqueVisit limit to 2 <==> relax twice at most
        int[] dis = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dis, -1);
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            int[] cur = q.poll();
            int node = cur[0], t = cur[1]; // arriving time
            if (dis[node] == t || uniqueVisit[node] >= 2)
                continue; // skip if it's same value or has been relaxed twice already
            uniqueVisit[node]++;
            dis[node
