Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning: One of the issues in the `memLeak` method is the condition of the while loop, which checks if the maximum of `memory1` and `memory2` is less than or equal to `i`. This condition will always evaluate to false when `memory1` and `memory2` are positive integers. The loop should continue while `memory1` or `memory2` is greater than `i`. Additionally, `i` should be incremented before checking the condition.

Fix:
1. Change the condition of the while loop to `memory1 > i || memory2 > i`.
2. Increment `i` before checking the condition.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int i = 1;
        while (memory1 > i || memory2 > i) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2)
                memory1 -= i;
            else
                memory2 -= i;
            i++;
        }
        return new int[] {i, memory1, memory2};
    }
}
```
