There are multiple bugs in the provided code:
1. In the `insertIntoTrie` method, the reverse string is being inserted into the trie using the key `' '`, which is incorrect. It should use the key `c`.
2. In the `isPresent` method of the `Trie` class, the second recursive call to `helper` uses the wrong key `' '` instead of the character `c`. This will result in incorrect trie traversal.
3. In the `isPresent` method, the `helper` method is being called with the wrong arguments. It should be called with `key`, `i + 1`, and `curr.children.get(c)`, instead of `root`.
4. In the `isPresent` method, the `helper` method does not handle the case where the current character does not exist in the trie. 

To fix these bugs:
1. In the `insertIntoTrie` method, change `curr.children.get(' ')` to `curr.children.get(c)` to insert the reverse string using the correct key.
2. In the `isPresent` method of the `Trie` class, change `curr.children.get(' ')` to `curr.children.get(c)` in the second recursive call to `helper`.
3. In the `isPresent` method, change the line `return helper(key, 0, root);` to `return helper(key, 0, curr);` to call the `helper` method with the correct arguments.
4. Modify the `helper` method to handle the case where the current character does not exist in the trie. If `curr.children.get(c)` is `null`, return `false` instead of making the recursive calls.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean placeWordInCrossword(char[][] board, String word) {
        String curr = "";

        Trie trie = new Trie();

        // Insert all horizontal strings
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '#') {
                    insertIntoTrie(trie, curr);
                    curr = "";
                } else {
                    curr += board[i][j];
                }
            }
            insertIntoTrie(trie, curr);
            curr = "";
        }

        // Insert all vertical strings
        for (int i = 0; i <
