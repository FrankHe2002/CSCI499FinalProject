Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: 

The bug can be identified by examining the code and identifying any operations or conditions that could lead to index out of bounds errors. In this case, the bug occurs in the while loop condition `y < tiles.length && x <= y`.

The `y < tiles.length` condition ensures that the index `y` is within the bounds of the `tiles` array. However, there is no corresponding condition to ensure that the index `x` is within bounds.

The fix is to add an additional condition `x < tiles.length` to ensure that both `x` and `y` are within bounds.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 45 ms (Top 71.1%) | Memory: 71.05 MB (Top 47.1%)

class Solution {
    public int maximumWhiteTiles(int[][] tiles, int carpetLen) {
        Arrays.sort(tiles, (a, b) -> {
            return a[0] - b[0];
        });
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        long maxCount = 0;
        long count = 0;

        while (x < tiles.length && y < tiles.length && x <= y) {
            long start = tiles[x][0];
            long end = tiles[y][1];

            if (end - start + 1 <= carpetLen) {
                count += tiles[y][1] - tiles[y][0] + 1;
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
                y++;
            } else {
                long midDist = start + carpetLen - 1;
                long s = tiles[y][-1];
                long e = tiles[y][1];
                if (midDist <= e && midDist >= s) maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count + midDist - s + 1);
                count -= tiles[x][1] - tiles[x][0] + 1;
                x++;
            }
        }
        return (int) maxCount;
    }
}
```
