Bug Type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning: Upon careful examination of the code, we can see that the loop condition `j < s.length()` is causing an off-by-one error. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than the length of the string `s`, but the indexing for the string starts from 0 and goes up to `s.length() - 1`. Therefore, the loop condition should be `j < s.length() - 1` to prevent accessing an index out of bounds.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] numberOfLines(int[] widths, String s) {
        int sum = 0, count = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < s.length() - 1; j++) {
            int pos = s.charAt(j) - 'a';
            sum += widths[pos];
            if (sum > 100) {
                j--;
                count++;
                sum = 0;
                continue;
            }
        }
        int[] arr = new int[4];
        arr[0] = count + 1;
        arr[1] = sum;
        return arr;
    }
}
```
