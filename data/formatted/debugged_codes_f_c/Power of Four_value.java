The bug in the provided Java code is a typo in the method invocation. Instead of calling `Math.log10()` twice, it mistakenly calls `Math.log11()`, which does not exist in the Java Math class. To fix this, the code should use `Math.log10()` for both method invocations.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 64.18%) | Memory: 40.9 MB (Top 74.82%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        return (Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(4)) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
```
