Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
1. The code is attempting to construct a lexicographically largest sequence with the following conditions:
   - The sequence contains integers from 1 to n (inclusive).
   - Each integer appears twice in the sequence.
   - Each pair of the same integer has a distance of that integer in the sequence.

2. The logic in this code is incorrect as it does not satisfy the given conditions. It fails to construct the sequence correctly.

Fix:
To fix the code, we need to revisit the logic and correct any errors. Below is the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] constructDistancedSequence(int n) {
        int[] ans = new int[n * 2 - 1];
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n + 1];
        calc(0, ans, visited, n);
        return ans;
    }

    private boolean calc(int index, int[] ans, boolean[] visited, int n) {
        if (index == ans.length) {
            return true;
        }
        if (ans[index] != 0)
            return calc(index + 1, ans, visited, n); // value already assigned in this position. So go ahead with the next index.
        else {
            for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
                if (visited[i]) continue;
                visited[i] = true;
                ans[index] = i;
                if (i == 1) {
                    if (calc(index + 1, ans, visited, n)) return true;
                } else if (index + i < ans.length && ans[index + i] == 0) {
                    visited[i] = true; // Marking the second occurrence of i as visited
                    // Assigning the second occurrence of i in the desired position i.e., (current index + i )
                    ans[index + i] = i;
                    if (calc(index + 1, ans, visited, n))
                        return true; // largest possible sequence satisfying the given conditions found.
                    ans[index + i] = 0; 
                    visited[i] = false; // Unmarking the second occurrence of i as visited
                }
                ans[index] = 0;
                visited[i] = false;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation of Fix:
1. In the original code, the second occurrence of integer i is not properly assigned and marked as
