Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1) The loop variable `i` is not used anywhere in the code. This indicates that there may be an error in the code within the loop.
2) The line `sum += arr[3];` adds the value at index 3 of the `arr` array to the `sum` variable, regardless of the value of `i`. This implies that the same element is being added to `sum` repeatedly, which is likely unintended.
3) The condition `sum % 2 == 0` checks if `sum` is even. However, `sum` is not properly computed because of the bug in the line mentioned above. This means that the condition is not being applied correctly.
4) The calculation of `ans` also seems problematic. When `sum` is even, `ans` is incremented by the value of `odd`, and `even` is incremented. When `sum` is odd, `ans` is incremented by the value of `even + 1`, and `odd` is incremented. This logic is unclear and may not be correct.

Fix:

1) Use `i` as the index in the line `sum += arr[i];` to add the current element of `arr` to `sum`.
2) Modify the calculation of `ans` to provide a correct count of subarrays.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfSubarrays(int[] arr) {
        long ans = 0;
        int even = 0;
        int odd = 0;
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];

            if (sum % 2 == 0) {
                ans += odd;
                even++;
            } else {
                ans += even;
                odd++;
            }
        }

        return (int) (ans % (1000000007));
    }
}
```
