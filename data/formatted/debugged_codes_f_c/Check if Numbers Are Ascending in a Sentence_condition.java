Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The provided code checks if each token in the string `s` is a number and if the number is strictly greater than the previous number `prev`. However, the code does not handle the case when a token is not a number. It catches any exception that occurs when trying to convert a token to an integer and does nothing with it. This means that if a token is not a number, the `prev` value remains unchanged, causing incorrect comparisons in subsequent iterations.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case when the first token is not a number. The initial value of `prev` is set to 0, assuming the first token will be a number. If the first token is not a number, it can lead to incorrect results.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areNumbersAscending(String s) {
        int prev = -1;

        for (String token : s.split(" ")) {
            try {
                int number = Integer.parseInt(token);
                if (prev != -1 && number <= prev)
                    return false;
                prev = number;
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. Change the initial value of `prev` to -1 instead of 0 to indicate that no previous number has been encountered yet.
2. Add a condition `prev != -1` in the if statement to skip the first token since there is no previous number.
3. Change `number < prev` to `number <= prev` to handle cases where consecutive tokens have the same number value.
4. Change the catch block from `catch (Exception e)` to `catch (NumberFormatException e)`. This is more specific and catches only the exception thrown when parsing a non-integer token.
5. Optionally, remove the empty catch block and add a comment explaining why the exception is intentionally ignored.
