The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition of the `while` loop. The condition `low > high` is incorrect because it will never be true. The loop should continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the loop condition from `low > high` to `low <= high`. This will ensure that the loop iterates until the left pointer surpasses the right pointer.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 26.3%) | Memory: 40.75 MB (Top 94.5%)

class Solution {
    public int countPairs(List<Integer> nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size();

        // Sort the List.
        Collections.sort(nums);

        // Initialize the number of pairs.
        int countPairs = 0;

        // Initialize the left and right pointers.
        int low = 0;
        int high = n - 1;

        // Iterate while the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer.
        while (low <= high) {
            // Calculate the sum of the two elements.
            int sum = nums.get(low) + nums.get(high);

            // If the sum is less than the target, then increment the number of pairs.
            if (sum < target) {
                countPairs += high - low;
                low++;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, decrement the right pointer.
                high--;
            }
        }

        // Return the number of pairs.
        return countPairs;
    }
}
```
