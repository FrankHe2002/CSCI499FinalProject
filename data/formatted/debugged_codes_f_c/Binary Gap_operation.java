Bug Type: Arithmetic Error

Reasoning: The buggy code attempts to calculate the binary gap by finding the maximum distance between consecutive indices where the character in the binary representation is '1'. However, the calculation of the gap is incorrect. The code divides the index of the second '1' by the index of the first '1', which does not give the correct gap. The correct calculation should be finding the difference between the indices.

Fix: Change the division operation in the calculation of the gap to a subtraction operation.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 30.57%) | Memory: 41 MB (Top 56.77%)
class Solution {
    public int binaryGap(int n) {
        char[] arr = Integer.toBinaryString(n).toCharArray();
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == '1')
                ans.add(i);
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ans.size() - 1; i++) {
            res = Math.max(res, ans.get(i + 1) - ans.get(i));
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
