The bug in the provided code is in the logic of checking if an artifact is fully dug. The variable `done` is not getting reset for each artifact, causing incorrect counting of fully dug artifacts.

To fix this bug, `done` should be set to `true` at the start of each artifact iteration. Additionally, the code can be optimized by immediately breaking out of the inner loop if `done` becomes `false` for any coordinate, since all coordinates within the artifact range need to be present for the artifact to be fully dug.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 198 ms (Top 10.48%) | Memory: 160.5 MB (Top 2.16%)
class Solution {
    public int digArtifacts(int n, int[][] artifacts, int[][] dig) {
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int d[] : dig) {
            set.add(d[0] + " " + d[1]);
        }
        int c = 0;
        for (int a[] : artifacts) {
            boolean done = true;
            for (int i = a[0]; i <= a[2]; i++) {
                for (int j = a[1]; j <= a[3]; j++) {
                    if (!set.contains(i + " " + j)) {
                        done = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!done) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (done) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
}
//TC = O(DIG + N^2)
```
