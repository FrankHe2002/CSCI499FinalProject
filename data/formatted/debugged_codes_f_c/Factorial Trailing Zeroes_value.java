Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The provided code attempts to calculate the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given number `n`. However, the calculation method is incorrect. It counts the number of factors of 2 instead of the number of factors of 5. 

Additionally, the condition in the while loop should be `n >= 5` instead of `n > 1`, as factors of 5 are needed to produce trailing zeros.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n >= 5) {
            count += n / 5;
            n = n / 5;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
