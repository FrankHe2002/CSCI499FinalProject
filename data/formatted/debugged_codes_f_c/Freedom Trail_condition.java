Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code is trying to find the minimum number of steps required to spell out a given "key" string using a "ring" string. However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. The code is missing a closing parenthesis (`)`) in line 13 after `ring.length()`.
2. The code is missing an import statement for `Map`, `TreeSet`, and `HashMap`.
3. The code is missing the class declaration for the provided code snippet, which is necessary to run and compile the code.
4. The code is missing the `class` keyword before the class declaration.

Based on these observations, the bug type can be identified as a combination of syntax errors and missing imports.

The fixed code should include the missing closing parenthesis, import statements, and class declaration. Additionally, the fixed code should be wrapped in a class declaration. The minimal changes required to fix the code are:

1. Add the necessary import statements.
2. Add the missing closing parenthesis in line 13.
3. Add the class declaration and keyword before the code snippet.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int findRotateSteps(String ring, String key) {
        Map<Character, TreeSet<Integer>> locMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < ring.length(); i++) {
            locMap.computeIfAbsent(ring.charAt(i), o -> new TreeSet<>()).add(i);
        }
        return dfs(0, 0, locMap, key, new int[key.length()][ring.length()]);
    }
 
    private int dfs(int cur, int where, Map<Character, TreeSet<Integer>> locMap, String key, int[][] memo) {
        if (cur == key.length()) { // the end
            return 0;
        }
        if (memo[cur][where] > 0) { // have computed [cur, end) already.
            return memo[cur][where];
        }
        TreeSet<Integer> idx = locMap.get(key.charAt(cur));
        if (idx.contains(where)) { // greedily take this if it is already matched
            return memo[cur][where] = dfs(cur + 1, where, locMap, key, memo) + 1;
        }
        Integer hi = idx.higher(where); // otherwise, we can take the higher key
        Integer lo = idx.lower(where); // or, the lower key
        if (hi == null)
