Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The provided code has a logical error in determining the length of the longest valid parentheses substring. The approach of counting the number of opening and closing parentheses is incorrect. Additionally, the code only increments `i` by 1 after each iteration of the inner while loop, which leads to an incorrect traversal of the string.

Fix: 

To fix the logic error, we can use a stack to track the indices of opening parentheses. The idea is to push the index of an opening parenthesis onto the stack and pop it when a closing parenthesis is encountered. The length of a valid parentheses substring can be calculated by subtracting the index of the topmost element in the stack from the current index. If the stack is empty, we push the current index onto the stack as a starting point for the next substring.

To correct the traversal of the string, we need to increment `i` by the length of the current valid parentheses substring instead of just by 1.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestValidParentheses(String s) {
        int len = 0;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(-1);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
                stack.push(i);
            } else {
                stack.pop();
                if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                    stack.push(i);
                } else {
                    len = Math.max(len, i - stack.peek());
                }
            }
        }
        
        return len;
    }
}
```
The fixed code above uses a stack to track the indices of opening parentheses. It starts with an initial index of -1 on the stack to handle cases where there are extra closing parentheses in the string. The code traverses the input string and appropriately pushes and pops indices on the stack. The `len` variable keeps track of the length of the longest valid parentheses substring encountered. At the end, it returns the calculated length.
