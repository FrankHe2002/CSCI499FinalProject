Bug Type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning: The off-by-one error in this code is related to the loop condition `i < s.length() - 1`. This condition stops the loop one iteration early, excluding the last character of the string from the comparison. As a result, the maximum consecutive count is not correctly calculated.

Fix: Change the loop condition to `i < s.length()`. This ensures that the loop iterates over all characters in the string, including the last character.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 40.49%) | Memory: 42.4 MB (Top 68.55%)
class Solution {
    public int maxPower(String s) {
        // O(n), assuming the access to every char is O(1)
        // iterate through characters
        // if char(n) == char(n+1) counter++
        // if counter > max, max = counter
        // else counter = 1 // 1 is init value because otherwise the compared char itself is not counted

        int maxConsecutive = 1; // 1 is init value because otherwise the compared char itself is not counted
        int counterConsecutive = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (i < s.length() - 1 && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                counterConsecutive++;
                maxConsecutive = Math.max(counterConsecutive, maxConsecutive);
            } else {
                counterConsecutive = 1;
            }
        }

        return maxConsecutive;
    }
}
```
