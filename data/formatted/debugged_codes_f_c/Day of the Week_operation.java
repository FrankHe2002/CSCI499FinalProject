Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, we can spot a logical error in the calculation of the `total` variable. The formula used to calculate `total` incorrectly multiplies it with the value of `day` at the end, instead of adding it. This results in an incorrect calculation of the day of the week.

Fix: To fix this bug, we need to change the line `total *= day;` to `total += day;`, thus ensuring that the `day` value is added to the total calculation rather than multiplied.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String dayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {
        String[] week = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};
        year--;
        int total = (year / 4) * 366 + (year - year / 4) * 365;
        int[] months = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        year++;
        if (year % 4 == 0 && year != 2100) {
            months[1]++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < month - 1; i++) {
            total += months[i];
        }
        total += day;
        return week[(total - 1) % 7];
    }
}
```
