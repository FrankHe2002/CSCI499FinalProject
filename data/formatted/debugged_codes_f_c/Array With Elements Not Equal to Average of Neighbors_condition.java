The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition of the for loop. The condition `i >= nums.length - 1` is incorrect, as it should be `i <= nums.length - 2` in order to iterate through the array correctly. 

Additionally, the code should handle the case when the array length is odd. In this case, the last element should remain unchanged since there is no subsequent element to swap with.

To fix the bug, the loop condition should be changed to `i <= nums.length - 2`, and an if statement should be added to check if the array length is odd before swapping elements.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums.length - 2; i += 2) {
            int temp = nums[i];
            nums[i] = nums[i + 1];
            nums[i + 1] = temp;
        }
        
        // Handle odd array length
        if (nums.length % 2 != 0) {
            int last = nums[nums.length - 1];
            nums[nums.length - 1] = nums[nums.length - 2];
            nums[nums.length - 2] = last;
        }
        
        return nums;
    }
}
```
