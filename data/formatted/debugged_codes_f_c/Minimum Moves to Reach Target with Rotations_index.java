Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The provided code has a syntax error. The line `result = prime * r1 + c1 + prime * r2 + c2;` is missing a semicolon at the end of the statement. This causes a syntax error because Java requires each statement to end with a semicolon.

Fix: Add a semicolon at the end of the statement `result = prime * r1 + c1 + prime * r2 + c2;`.
