Bug Type: Incorrect pointer assignment.

Reasoning: The provided code aims to delete a node from a singly linked list. However, the code is incorrectly assigning the next node's value to the current node without actually deleting the next node. This results in a logical error where the linked list structure is not maintained.

Fix: To correctly delete the node, the code should reassign the next pointer of the current node to the node after the next node. This can be done by updating `node.next` to `node.next.next`. The value assignment `node.val = node.next.val` is valid and can be kept as is.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00*) | Memory: 44.5 MB (Top 10.41%)
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```
