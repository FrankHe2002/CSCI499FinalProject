Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the logic used to count the number of splits in the given string is incorrect. The code compares the number of distinct characters on each side of the split (`ds1` and `ds2`), but it does not check if both sides have an equal number of occurrences for each character. As a result, the code can incorrectly count a split even if the characters are not divided evenly.

Fix:

To fix this logic error, we need to modify the code to include a check for equal occurrences of characters on both sides of the split. This can be done by maintaining a separate array to track the number of distinct characters on each side (`a` and `b`). We will increment the count only when the number of occurrences of a character is the same on both sides.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numSplits(String s) {
        int a[] = new int[26];
        int b[] = new int[26];
        int ds1 = 0, ds2 = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            b[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            if (b[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 1)
                ds2++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            a[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            b[s.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
            if (b[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 0)
                ds2--;
            if (a[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == b[s.charAt(i) - 'a'])
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the comparison for `ds1 == ds2` has been replaced with `a[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == b[s.charAt(i) - 'a']` to accurately count the splits based on equal occurrences of characters on both sides. Additionally, the character index calculation `s.charAt(i) - 97` has been changed to `s.charAt(i) - 'a'` for better readability.
