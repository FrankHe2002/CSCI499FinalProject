Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The bug in the code is a logical error. The code calculates the longest increase subsequence (LIS) and the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) for every index `i` in the array `nums`. It then calculates the maximum of LIS + LDS and stores it in the variable `max`. Finally, it returns `n - max`, which represents the minimum number of mountain removals required. 

The logical error is in the condition `if (LIS[i] > 1 && LDS[i] > 1)` inside the second loop. This condition is incorrect because it incorrectly checks if both LIS and LDS are greater than 1, instead of checking if either LIS or LDS is greater than 1. This means that if any index has either LIS or LDS equal to 1, it won't be considered as a valid mountain and won't contribute to the calculation of `max`.

To fix this logical error, the condition should be changed to `if (LIS[i] > 1 || LDS[i] > 1)`, ensuring that any index with either LIS or LDS greater than 1 is considered as a valid mountain.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 103 ms (Top 13.28%) | Memory: 45.9 MB (Top 81.01%)
class Solution {
    public int minimumMountainRemovals(int[] nums) {

        int n = nums.length;
        int[] LIS = new int[n];
        int[] LDS = new int[n];

        Arrays.fill(LIS, 1);
        Arrays.fill(LDS, 1);
        // calculate the longest increase subsequence (LIS) for every index i
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j] && LIS[j] + 1 > LIS[i])
                    LIS[i] = LIS[j] + 1;
            }
        }

        // calculate the longest decreasing subsequence(LDS) for every index i and keep track of the maximum of LIS+LDS
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = n - 1; j > i; j--) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j] && LDS[j] + 1 > LDS
