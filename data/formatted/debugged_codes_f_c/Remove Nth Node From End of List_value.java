Bug type: Logic/Error

Reasoning: After analyzing the code, it appears that the bug lies in the calculation of the variable `frontlen`. The variable should represent the number of nodes from the front of the list until the node that should be removed (n nodes from the end), but the current calculation is subtracting `n` from `len` and then subtracting `1`. This results in the wrong position for the node to be removed.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the calculation of `frontlen` needs to be adjusted. Instead of subtracting `n` and `1` from `len`, we should simply subtract `n` from `len` to accurately represent the position of the node to be removed.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 72.17%) | Memory: 42.2 MB (Top 52.36%)
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode temp = head;
        int len = 0;

        if (head == null || head.next == null)
            return null;

        while (temp != null) {
            temp = temp.next;
            len++;
        }

        if (len == n)
            return head.next;

        int frontlen = len - n;

        ListNode first = head.next;
        ListNode second = head;

        int count = 0;

        while (first != null) {
            if (count == frontlen) {
                second.next = first.next;
                break;
            } else {
                first = first.next;
                second = second.next;
                count++;
            }
        }

        return head;
    }
}
```
