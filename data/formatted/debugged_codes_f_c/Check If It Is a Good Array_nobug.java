Buggy Code Explanation:
The code seems to have a bug related to the `GCD` method. The method appears to implement the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. However, the method is not being used correctly in the `isGoodArray` method. The bug is that the `GCD` method is being called like a regular function, but it should be called as a method of the `Solution` class. Additionally, the `GCD` method should be declared as `static` since it is being called from a static context.

Fixing the bug involves making the following changes:
1. Change the method call `GCD(gcd, nums[i])` to `Solution.GCD(gcd, nums[i])` to call the method as a static method of the `Solution` class.
2. Add the `static` keyword to the `GCD` method declaration to make it a static method.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isGoodArray(int[] nums) {
        int gcd = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            gcd = Solution.GCD(gcd, nums[i]);
            if (gcd == 1)
                return true;
        }
        return gcd == 1;

    }

    static int GCD(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return GCD(b, a % b);
        }

    }
}
```
