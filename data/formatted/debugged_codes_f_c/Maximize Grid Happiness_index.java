Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning: The bug is likely caused by a mismatch between the dimensions of the `dp` array and the indices used to access its elements. The buggy code tries to access `dp[row + 2][in_count][ex_count][prev_in_pos][prev_ex_pos]` but only initializes the `dp` array with dimensions `m + 1`, `introvertsCount + 1`, `extrovertsCount + 1`, `(1 << (n + 1))`, and `(1 << (n + 1))`. Since the indices start from 0, the valid indices for each dimension are from 0 to `m`, 0 to `introvertsCount`, 0 to `extrovertsCount`, 0 to `(1 << (n + 1)) - 1`, and 0 to `(1 << (n + 1)) - 1`, respectively. As a result, the `dp` array does not have a valid element at index `dp[row + 2][in_count][ex_count][prev_in_pos][prev_ex_pos]`, triggering the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indices used to access the `dp` array are within its valid bounds. Since the original code uses the indices `row + 2`, we can fix the bug by initializing the `dp` array with dimensions `m + 3` instead of `m + 1`. This change allows for accessing elements up to index `m + 2`.
