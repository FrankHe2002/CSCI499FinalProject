Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 
1. The code attempts to check if the given `hand` of cards can be divided into straight hands of `groupSize`.
2. The code uses a `Map` to keep track of the frequency of each card.
3. It then uses a `PriorityQueue` (`minHeap`) to keep track of the minimum card value.
4. It iterates over the `minHeap` and checks for each card value in the range `(min, min + groupSize)` if it exists in the `map` and has a non-zero frequency.
5. If a card doesn't exist or has a frequency of zero, it returns `false`. If it has a frequency of zero, it removes it from the `minHeap`.

Bug:
The bug lies in the loop that checks for the existence of cards and the frequency of each card. When checking for card existence, the condition should be `!map.containsKey(i)` instead of `map.containsKey(i)`. Similarly, when checking for the non-zero frequency, it should be `map.get(i) == 0` instead of `map.get(i) != 0`. These conditions are inverted, causing incorrect behavior.

Fix:
1. Invert the conditions in the loop that checks for card existence and non-zero frequency.
2. Modify the range in the loop to `for (int i = min; i < min + groupSize; i++)` as it should iterate only until `min + groupSize - 1`.

class Solution {
    public boolean isNStraightHand(int[] hand, int groupSize) {

            return false;

        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();

        for (int card : hand) {
            if (map.containsKey(card))
                map.put(card, map.get(card) + 1);
            else {
                map.put(card, 1);
                minHeap.add(card);
            }
        }

        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int min = minHeap.peek();
            for (int i = min; i < min + groupSize; i++) {
                if (!map.containsKey(i) || map.get(i) == 0)
                    return false;
                map.put(i, map.get
