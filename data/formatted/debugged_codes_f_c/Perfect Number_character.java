Bug Type: Logical error

Reasoning: The code has a logical error in the for loop condition. The loop iterates until `i` is less than the square root of `num`, but it should iterate until `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. This condition prevents checking for factors of `num` that are equal to the square root.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 51.95%) | Memory: 40.9 MB (Top 44.38%)
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPerfectNumber(int num) {
        if (num == 1)
            return false;

        int sum = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                sum += i + num / i;
            }
        }
        if (sum == num) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
