Bug Type: Logical Error

Bug Explanation: The code has a logical error in the `fun` method where the variable `y` is set to `k + 10` within the loop. This causes `y` to always be greater than or equal to 10, resulting in the `if` condition `y == 0` to never evaluate to true. As a result, the code incorrectly checks for divisibility by 10, which is incorrect for self-dividing numbers.

Fix: Change `int y = k + 10;` to `int y = k % 10;` inside the `fun` method. This fix correctly assigns the last digit of `k` to `y` for divisibility checks.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> selfDividingNumbers(int left, int right) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (left <= right) {
            if (fun(left))
                ans.add(left);
            left++;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    boolean fun(int x) {
        int k = x;
        while (k > 0) {
            int y = k % 10;
            k = k / 10;
            if (y == 0 || x % y != 0)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
