The bug in the provided code is in the nested for loop where `j` is being used before declaring it. This results in a compilation error. To fix this bug, we need to move the declaration of `j` before the nested loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String[] words) {
        int[][] freq = new int[26][26];//array for all alphabet combinations
        for (String word : words)
            freq[word.charAt(0) - 'a'][word.charAt(1) - 'a']++;// here we first increase the freq for every word
        int left = 0;//to store freq counts
        boolean odd = false;
        for (int i = 0; i != 26; i++) {//iterate over our array
            for (int j = i + 1; j != 26; j++) {//nested iteration to find non similar pairs
                odd |= (freq[j][i] & 1) == 1;//means odd number of freq for similar words are there
                left += Math.min(freq[i][j], freq[j][i]);//taking min times from both present
            }
            left += freq[i][i] / 2;
        }
        int res = left * 2 * 2;//res from total freq found!!
        if (odd) {
            res += 2;// if odd then adding 2
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
