Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided buggy code is an implementation of the "Add Operators" problem. However, it contains several bugs that need to be fixed.

1. Missing Import Statements: The code is missing necessary import statements for the `List`, `ArrayList`, and `ArrayList` classes. These import statements need to be added at the beginning of the file.

2. List Type Declaration: The type of the `result` field is declared as `List<String>`, which is preferred as an interface type rather than a concrete class type. This can be fixed by changing the declaration to `ArrayList<String>`.

3. Missing Semicolons: There are several missing semicolons in the code. Semicolons need to be added at the end of the lines where they are missing.

4. Incorrect Operator Conditions: The conditions in the `operator` method are incorrect. The conditions should be `(prev != -1)` and `(prev == -1)` instead of `(prev != - 1)` and `(prev == 1)` respectively.

5. Index Out of Bounds: The `operator` method is accessing elements of the `l` list using `i - 1` index, which can lead to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if `i == 0`. This can be fixed by initializing `i` with `1` instead of `0`.

6. Incorrect Multiplication Operator: The multiplication operator in the `operator` method is using the wrong symbol (`*` instead of `×`). This needs to be fixed by using the correct symbol (`×`).

7. Integer Overflow: The `prod` and `mid` variables are declared as `long` but are multiplied by `l.get(i)` without casting it to `long`. This can cause integer overflow. The multiplication should be performed with `l.get(i)` casted to `long` to avoid integer overflow.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    String s;
    ArrayList<String> result;
    int target;

    public void operator(int i, int prev, long prod, long mid, String exp, List<Long> l) {
        if (i == l.size()) {
            if (mid + prod == target)
                result.add(exp);
            return;
        }
        if (prev != -1) {
            operator(i + 1, 0, -1 * l.get(i) * l.get(i - 1), mid + l.get(i - 1
