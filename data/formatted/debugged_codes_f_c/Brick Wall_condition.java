Bug Type: Syntax Errors, Logic Error

Reasoning: 
1. There are two syntax errors in this code:
   - Line 12 is missing a semicolon at the end of the statement `result += c`.
   - Line 21 is missing a closing parenthesis at the end of the method `leastBricks`.

2. The logic error is in the calculation of the `max_frequency` variable. The frequency should be compared with the maximum frequency seen so far (`Math.max(edge_frequency.get(edge_postion), max_frequency)`), but in the code, the calculation compares the value stored in `edge_frequency.get(edge_postion)` with the current `edge_postion` value. This will not give the correct maximum frequency.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 21.1%) | Memory: 46.16 MB (Top 61.8%)

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int leastBricks(List<List<Integer>> wall) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> edge_frequency = new HashMap<>(); //HashMap to store the number of common edges among the rows
        int max_frequency = 0; //Variable to store the frequency of most occurring edge

        for (int row = 0; row < wall.size(); row++) //Iterating through each row
        {
            int edge_postion = 0; //Variable to store different edge position

            for (int brick_no = 0; brick_no < wall.get(row).size() - 1; brick_no++) //Iterating through each brick inside a row
            {
                int current_brick_length = wall.get(row).get(brick_no); //Length of the current brick
                edge_postion = edge_postion + current_brick_length; //Next Edge Position = Previous Edge Position + Current Brick's Length
                edge_frequency.put(edge_postion, edge_frequency.getOrDefault(edge_postion, 0) + 1); //Incrementing the Frequency of just calculated Edge Position
                max_frequency = Math.max(edge_frequency.get(edge_postion), max_frequency); //Comparing the "Frequency of just calculated Edge Position" with "Max Frequency seen till now" & storing whichever is greater.
            }
        }
        return wall.size() - max_frequency; // returning (Number of Bricks Crossed by Line) i.e. (Number of Rows in Wall - Frequency of Most Occurring Edge)
    }
}
