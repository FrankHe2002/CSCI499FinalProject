Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The provided code has a logical error. The `getSum` method should calculate the sum of two integers `a` and `b`. However, it uses the `Integer.sum()` method to perform the addition. The `Integer.sum()` method actually calculates the sum using the bitwise XOR operation, which is not the same as the regular addition operation. 

Fix: The fix is to replace the `Integer.sum(a, b)` with the addition operation `a + b` to correctly calculate the sum of `a` and `b`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {

    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
