Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The provided code implements a backtracking algorithm to check if a given string `num` is an additive number. The code iterates through the characters of the string and attempts to form additive numbers by comparing the sum of the previous two numbers with the current number.

The bug occurs in the condition `if (sum < currLong)` and `else if (sum > currLong)`. These conditions incorrectly handle the case when `currLong` is equal to `sum`. According to the algorithm's logic, if `currLong` is equal to `sum`, it should continue checking for more digits. However, the code currently skips this check and prematurely breaks or continues the loop.

To fix this bug, the conditions `if (sum < currLong)` and `else if (sum > currLong)` should be modified to `if (sum != currLong)`. This change ensures that the algorithm explicitly checks if `currLong` is equal to `sum` before making any decisions.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAdditiveNumber(String num) {
        return backtrack(num, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    }

    public boolean backtrack(String num, int idx, long sum, long prev, int length) {
        if (idx == num.length()) {
            return length >= 3;
        }

        long currLong = 0;

        for (int i = idx; i < num.length(); i++) {
            // make sure it won't start with 0
            if (i > idx && num.charAt(idx) == '0') {
                break;
            }
            
            currLong = currLong * 10 + num.charAt(i) - '0';

            if (length >= 2) {
                if (sum != currLong) {
                    // currLong is not equal to sum of previous 2 numbers
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            // currLong == sum of previous 2 numbers
            if (backtrack(num, i + 1, currLong + prev, currLong, length + 1)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```
