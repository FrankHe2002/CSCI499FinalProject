Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The code is intended to find the number of identical pairs in the provided array. However, the logic used is incorrect. The code counts every pair where two elements are equal, regardless of their indices. This results in duplicate counting and incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to change the inner loop's starting index to `i + 1` instead of `0`. This ensures that we only compare each element with the elements that come after it in the array.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 85.5%) | Memory: 40.27 MB (Top 18.8%)

class Solution {
    public int numIdenticalPairs(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
                if (nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
```
