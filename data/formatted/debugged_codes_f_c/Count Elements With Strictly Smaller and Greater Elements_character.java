Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

The buggy code is trying to count the number of elements in the array `nums` that are greater than the minimum element (`nmin`) and less than the maximum element (`nmax`). However, the calculation of `nmin` and `nmax` is incorrect. The code initializes `nmin` with the maximum value of an integer and `nmax` with the minimum value of an integer. This initialization makes `nmin` always equal to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `nmax` always equal to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` respectively. 

The logical error lies in comparing `a > nmin && a < nmax`. Since `nmin` is always greater than any value in the array `nums` and `nmax` is always smaller than any value in the array `nums`, the condition `a > nmin && a < nmax` will never be true, resulting in a count of 0.

Fix: 

To fix the bug, we need to correctly initialize `nmin` and `nmax`. Instead of using `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, we can initialize `nmin` with the first element of the array `nums` and `nmax` with the same value. This ensures that `nmin` and `nmax` are within the valid range of values in the array. Then, the loop can correctly find the minimum and maximum elements in `nums`.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countElements(int[] nums) {
        int nmin = nums[0];
        int nmax = nums[0];
        for (int a : nums) {
            nmin = Math.min(a, nmin);
            nmax = Math.max(a, nmax);
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int a : nums) {
            if (a > nmin && a < nmax)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
