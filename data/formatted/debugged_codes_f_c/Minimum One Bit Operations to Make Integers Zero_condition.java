Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The bug in the provided code lies in the loop condition. The loop should iterate until `n` becomes zero, which means the condition should be `n != 0`. However, the current condition `n == 0` is incorrect, which causes the loop to terminate immediately when `n` is not zero. This logical error prevents the code from correctly performing the required operations on `n`.

Fix:
Change the loop condition from `n == 0` to `n != 0` to ensure the loop iterates until `n` becomes zero.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 52 ms (Top 5.71%) | Memory: 41.9 MB (Top 21.90%)
class Solution {
    public int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {

        int inv = 0;

        // xor until n becomes zero
        for (; n != 0; n = n >> 1) {

            inv ^= n;
            System.out.println(inv + " " + n);
        }

        return inv;
    }
}
```
