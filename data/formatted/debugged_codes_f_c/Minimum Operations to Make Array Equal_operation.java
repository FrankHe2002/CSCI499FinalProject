Bug type: Arithmetic error

Reasoning: 

1. The code calculates the number of operations (ans) needed to make all elements of an array of length n equal.
2. For an odd value of n, the code adds 1 to ans.
3. However, the code uses n % 2 to add 1 to ans, which results in 0 for odd values of n.
4. This is because n % 2 gives the remainder when n is divided by 2. For odd values of n, the remainder is 1, not 0.
5. Therefore, the code should add 1 to ans for odd values of n, not n % 2.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int n) {
        int ans = (n / 2) * (n / 2);
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            ans += 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
