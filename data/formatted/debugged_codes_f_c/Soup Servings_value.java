The bug in the provided code is in the calculation of `n`. The code divides `n` by 25 and takes the ceiling value, but the problem statement specifies that each serving is 25ml, so dividing by 25 doesn't make sense. 

The fix is to remove the line `n = (int) Math.ceil(n * 1.0 / 25);` since it's not necessary. 

Here is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 90.5%) | Memory: 39.55 MB (Top 93.7%)

class Solution {
    public double soupServings(int n) {
        if (n > 4800) return 1;
        double dp[][] = new double[n + 1][n + 1];
        return helper(n, n, dp);
    }

    double helper(int a, int b, double dp[][]) {
        if (a <= 0 && b <= 0) return 0.5;
        if (b <= 0) return 0;
        if (a <= 0) return 1;
        if (dp[a][b] > 0) return dp[a][b];
        return dp[a][b] = 0.25 * (helper(a - 4, b, dp) + helper(a - 3, b - 1, dp) + helper(a - 2, b - 2, dp) + helper(a - 1, b - 3, dp));
    }
}
