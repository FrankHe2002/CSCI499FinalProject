The bug in the provided code is that the loop condition `m <= maxTriangular` should be changed to `m < maxTriangular`. This is because the condition `m <= maxTriangular` allows `m` to take the value of `maxTriangular` in the loop iteration, leading to incorrect calculation of the triangular number.

In the fixed code, I will change the loop condition to `m < maxTriangular`.

```java
// Runtime: 6 ms (Top 75.69%) | Memory: 41.1 MB (Top 34.74%)
class Solution {

    public int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) {
        final double eightN = (8d * ((double) n)); // convert to double because 8n can overflow int
        final int maxTriangular = (int) Math.floor((- 1d + Math.sqrt(1d + eightN)) / 2d);
        int ways = 1;
        int triangular = 1;
        for (int m = 2; m < maxTriangular; ++ m) {
            triangular += m;
            final int difference = n - triangular;
            if ((difference % m) == 0) {
                ways++;
            }
        }
        return ways;
    }

}
