Bug Type: Recursive Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The code implements a recursive solution to determine if a frog can cross a series of stones in a certain pattern.
2. The initial check `(stones[i] + k == stones[stones.length - 1])` correctly verifies if the frog can directly jump from the current stone to the last stone with the given jump length.
3. However, there is an issue in the loop that iterates through the possible next stones that the frog can reach.
4. The loop condition `stones[i] + k >= stones[temp]` is used to identify the next possible stone that the frog can reach, but it should exit the loop when the jump is not greater than or equal to `stones[temp]` instead of just greater than.
5. This means that if the jump from the current stone is not able to reach the next possible stone, the loop does not exit and continues to iterate beyond the valid stone indices, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in subsequent recursive calls.
6. Additionally, the condition `(stones[i] + k < stones[i + 1])` is intended to handle the case when the jump from the current stone is smaller than the distance to the next stone, but it should be `stones[temp]` instead of `stones[i + 1]` to compare against the correct next stone.
7. To fix the issue, the loop condition should be `stones[i] + k > stones[temp]` to exit the loop when the jump is not greater than the next stone, and the condition `(stones[i] + k < stones[i + 1])` should be `stones[temp]` instead of `stones[i + 1]`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    static boolean flag = false;   // If flag is true no more operations in recursion, directly return statement

    public boolean canCross(int[] stones) {
        int i = 0; // starting stone
        int k = 1; // starting jump
        flag = false;
        return canBeCrossed(stones, k, i);
    }

    public boolean canBeCrossed(int[] stones, int k, int i) {
        if (!flag) { // If flag is false
            if (stones[i] + k == stones[stones.length - 1]) { // If frog do 'k' jump from current stone lands on last stones, no more recursive calls and return true
                flag = true;
