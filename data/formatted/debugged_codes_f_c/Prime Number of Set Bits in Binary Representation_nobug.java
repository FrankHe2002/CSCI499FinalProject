Buggy Code Explanation:
1. The `calculateSetBits` method correctly counts the number of '1' bits in a given string.
2. The `isPrime` method correctly checks if a number is prime.
3. The `countPrimeSetBits` method loops from `left` to `right`, inclusive. For each number, it converts the number to its binary representation, counts the number of '1' bits using `calculateSetBits`, and checks if the count is prime using `isPrime`. It increments the `count` if the count is prime.
4. There are no syntax errors or logical errors in the code, but there are some code quality issues:
   - The variable `b` in the `countPrimeSetBits` method is not descriptive. It would be better to rename it to something more meaningful, such as `binary`.
   - The `isPrime` method performs unnecessary iterations by checking divisibility up to `n / 2`. It can be optimized to check up to the square root of `n`, reducing the number of iterations.
   - There is a commented-out `System.out.println` statement in the `isPrime` method that can be removed.
   - The code does not handle negative input values for `left` and `right`. Since negative numbers do not have binary representations, it would make sense to throw an exception or provide some other form of error handling.

Bug Type: Code Quality

Fixing the Bug:
1. Rename the variable `b` in the `countPrimeSetBits` method to `binary`.
2. Optimize the `isPrime` method by checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
3. Remove the commented-out `System.out.println` statement in the `isPrime` method.
4. Add error handling for negative input values of `left` and `right`.
