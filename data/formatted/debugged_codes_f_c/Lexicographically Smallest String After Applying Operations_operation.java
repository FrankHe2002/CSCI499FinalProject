Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code has a few issues:
1. The `HashSet` set is not initialized before being used in the `dfs` method. This will result in a `NullPointerException` when trying to invoke a method on it.
2. The `dfs` method doesn't terminate properly. It should include a base case to stop the recursion. Currently, it relies on the `set.contains(s)` check to determine when to stop, but it's possible for the recursion to continue indefinitely if there is no repetition in the strings.
3. The `addA` method performs an incorrect calculation. It currently calculates `temp` as the decimal value of the character in `c[i]` instead of the numeric value. Converting a character to its numeric value should be done by subtracting `'0'` from it.
4. The `rotateB` method performs an unnecessary calculation and has incorrect logic for rotating the string. It should rotate the string by `b` positions to the right, but it currently rotates it `s.length() - b` positions to the left.

To fix these issues, the following changes need to be made:
1. Initialize the `set` variable in the `findLexSmallestString` method.
2. Modify the `dfs` method to include a base case that stops the recursion when there is a repetition in the strings.
3. Fix the calculation of `temp` in the `addA` method by subtracting `'0'` from `c[i]`.
4. Correct the logic in the `rotateB` method to rotate the string `b` positions to the right instead of the left.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    private String result;

    public String findLexSmallestString(String s, int a, int b) {
        result = s;
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        dfs(s, a, b, set);
        return result;
    }

    private void dfs(String s, int a, int b, HashSet<String> set) {
        if (set.contains(s))
            return;
        set.add(s);
        String s1, s2;
        s1 = addA(s, a);
        s2 = rotateB(s, b);
        dfs(s1, a, b, set);
        dfs(s2, a, b, set);
    }

    private String addA(String s, int a) {
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        int temp
