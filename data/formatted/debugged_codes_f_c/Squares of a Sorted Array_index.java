Bug type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Explanation: 

The buggy code attempts to access an out-of-bounds index in the array `nums`. The while loop condition `s <= e` allows the loop to continue even when `s` becomes less than 0. This results in accessing `nums[s - 1]`, which throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` since arrays in Java start from index 0.

Fix: 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the loop condition to ensure that `s` never becomes less than 0. We can change the condition to `s < e` instead of `s <= e` since there is no need to continue the loop when `s` becomes equal to `e`.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = nums.length - 1;
        int p = nums.length - 1;
        int[] a = new int[nums.length];
        while (s < e) {
            if (nums[s] * nums[s] > nums[e] * nums[e]) {
                a[p--] = nums[s] * nums[s];
                s++;
            } else {
                a[p--] = nums[e] * nums[e];
                e--;
            }
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
