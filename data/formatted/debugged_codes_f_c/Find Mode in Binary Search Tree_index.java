Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: 
1. The bug is identified by analyzing the loop condition `i < list.size()` and the indexing statement `res[3] = list.get(i);`.
2. The indexing statement incorrectly assigns `list.get(i)` to `res[3]` in every iteration of the loop, instead of using the variable `i` to index `res[i]`.
3. This will cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `i` reaches the value of `3` (assuming the list size is less than `4`).
4. The bug can be fixed by changing the indexing statement to `res[i] = list.get(i);`, ensuring that each element of `list` is assigned to the corresponding index in `res`.

        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>(); //we are taking map to count each and every value of the tree and the no of times they occurs in the tree
        Queue<TreeNode> qu = new LinkedList<TreeNode>(); // to itereate over the tree
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>(); //to save our result into a dynamic arraylist then will convert into static array for return it
        qu.add(root);                     // add the first root node into queue to iterate over the tree
        while (! qu.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode tmp = qu.poll();               //we poll out the node which is last inputed to the queue
            if (map.containsKey(tmp.val)) {           //we are checking through the map wheather the value this node have already stored into the map or not
                map.put(tmp.val, map.get(tmp.val) + 1);     //the value is already stored then we just increase the count by 1
            } else {
                map.put(tmp.val, 1);     //if the value is unique then we store it to the map with the count 1
            }
            if (tmp.left != null)
                qu.add(tmp.left);    //this way we are checking wheather left node has any value or not respect to the current poped element of queue
            if (tmp.right != null)
                qu.add(tmp.right);
