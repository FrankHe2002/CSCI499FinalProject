The bug in the provided code is in the condition of the while loop. The loop should continue as long as `ans` is greater than 0, not less than or equal to 0.

The fix is to change the condition from `ans <= 0` to `ans > 0`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int ans = x ^ y;
        int count = 0;
        while (ans > 0) {
            count += ans & 1;
            ans >>= 1;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
