Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug lies in the condition where `i != s.length()` is checked. This condition is redundant and should be removed because `i` can only reach `s.length()` if all characters in `s` have been matched successfully. Additionally, the last condition `j == p.length()` is incorrect because it would only be true if there are trailing `*` characters in `p`, which is not necessary for a match. The fix is to remove both conditions and directly return `true` after the loop ends.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int starIdx = -1;
        int lastMatch = -1;

        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (j < p.length() && (s.charAt(i) == p.charAt(j) || p.charAt(j) == '?')) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (j < p.length() && p.charAt(j) == '*') {
                starIdx = j;
                lastMatch = i;
                j++;
            } else if (starIdx != -1) {
                j = starIdx + 1;
                lastMatch++;
                i = lastMatch;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }

        while (j < p.length() && p.charAt(j) == '*') {
            j++;
        }

        return j == p.length();
    }
}
```
