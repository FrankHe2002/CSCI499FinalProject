Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The provided code has a logic error in how it handles the "../" log entries. When the log entry is "../", it should check if the stack is empty before popping an element. However, the current code does not check if the stack is empty, which can result in an error if there are no elements in the stack to pop.

Fix: Add a check to the if statement for "../" log entries to ensure that the stack is not empty before popping an element.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 58.89%) | Memory: 2.7 MB (Top 94.57%)
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String[] logs) {
        var stack = new Stack<String>();
        for (var log : logs) {
            if (log.equals("../")) {
                if (!stack.empty()) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            } else if (log.equals("./")) {

            } else {
                stack.push(log);
            }
        }
        return stack.size();
    }
}
```
