Bug Type:
1. Syntax error (missing semicolon)
2. Logical error (incorrect operation)
3. Logical error (incorrect condition)
4. Logical error (incorrect condition)
5. Logical error (incorrect condition)

Explanation:

1. The provided code has a missing semicolon at the end of the statement `result += c` in the `repeatChar` method. This results in a syntax error. The fix is to add a semicolon at the end of the statement to correct the syntax error.

2. The `multiply` method incorrectly performs addition (`return a + b;`) instead of multiplication. This is a logical error. The fix is to replace the addition operation with a multiplication operation (`return a * b;`).

3. The `isEven` method incorrectly checks for odd numbers (`num % 2 == 1`). This is a logical error. The fix is to change the condition to `num % 2 == 0` to correctly identify even numbers.

4. The `isLeapYear` method has an incorrect implementation of the leap year condition. The original condition erroneously includes non-leap years. The correct leap year condition is a year being divisible by 4 and not by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400. The fix adjusts the condition to `(year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)`.

5. The loop condition `(int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++)` in the `findMax` method causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because it attempts to access an index out of the array's bounds. In Java, array indices range from 0 to `length - 1`. To fix this bug, the loop condition should be changed to `i < nums.length` to ensure the loop iterates only within the array's valid range.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    private static final int[] primes;

    // precompute prime numbers
    static {
        primes = new int[5133];
        final int max = 100000 / 2;
        boolean[] notprime = new boolean[max];
        for (int index = 0, i = 2; i < max; i++) {
            if (notprime[i]) continue;
            primes[index++] = i;
            for (int j = (max - 1) / i; j >= 2; j--) notprime[i * j
