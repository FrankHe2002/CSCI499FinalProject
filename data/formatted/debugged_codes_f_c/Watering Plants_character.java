Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:

1. The code is supposed to count the number of times the plants need to be watered based on their individual water requirements (`plants`) and the capacity (`capacity`) of the watering can.
2. The logic of the code is incorrect in the else block.
3. Instead of incrementing `count` by `(i + 1)`, it should be incremented by 1, as only one refill is needed to water the current plant (`plants[i]`).
4. Also, the calculation of `count` at this step is incorrect. Adding `(i + 1)` to `count` is incorrect because `(i + 1)` represents the zero-based index of the next plant, not the number of plants watered. So, it should be `count + 1`.
5. Additionally, the order of statements in the else block is incorrect. The current plant (`plants[i]`) should be subtracted from `c` before resetting `c` to `capacity`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int wateringPlants(int[] plants, int capacity) {
        int count = 0, c = capacity;
        for (int i = 0; i < plants.length; i++) {
            if (c >= plants[i]) {
                c -= plants[i];
                count++;
            } else {
                count++;
                c = capacity - plants[i];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
