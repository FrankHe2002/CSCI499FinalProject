Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

The buggy code aims to compute the sum of the four divisors of each number in the input array. However, the implementation has a logical error in the condition `count == 4`. This condition checks if the current number has exactly four divisors, but it does not ensure that those divisors are distinct. As a result, the code counts divisors twice if they are not perfect squares.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition `count == 4` to `count == 2` in order to correctly count the distinct divisors.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumFourDivisors(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i * i <= val; i++) {
                if (val % i == 0) {
                    sum += i;
                    count++;
                    if (i != val / i) {
                        sum += val / i;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (count == 2) {
                res += sum;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
