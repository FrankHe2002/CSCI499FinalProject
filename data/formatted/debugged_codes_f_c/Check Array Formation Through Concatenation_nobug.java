Bug Type: Logical Error/Issue

Reasoning:
Upon reviewing the provided buggy code, it appears that the bug lies within the logic of the code. The code is trying to check if the given `arr` array can be formed using the `pieces` 2D array. It maps the first element of each inner array in `pieces` to a key in a `HashMap`, then iterates over the `arr` array checking if each element exists in the `HashMap`. If an element is found in the `HashMap`, it checks if the remaining elements in the inner array match the subsequent elements in `arr`. If everything matches, it continues to the next element in `arr`. If not, it immediately returns `false`.

However, the issue arises when the code checks if `val != arr[index]`. This condition is incorrect because it's comparing the element from the `pieces` array with the element from the `arr` array. The correct comparison should be between `arr[index]` and the first element of the inner array in the `pieces` array (`list[0]`).

Additionally, the code also needs to handle the case where the `arr` array is longer than the number of elements in `list`. Currently, if `index >= arr.length`, the code returns `false`. This check should be moved before checking if `val != arr[index]` to ensure that the size of the `arr` array and the `list` array are compatible.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean canFormArray(int[] arr, int[][] pieces) {
        HashMap<Integer, int[]> hm = new HashMap();
        for (int[] list : pieces)
            hm.put(list[0], list);

        int index = 0;
        while (index < arr.length) {
            if (!hm.containsKey(arr[index]))
                return false;

            int[] list = hm.get(arr[index]);
            for (int val : list) {
                if (index >= arr.length || val != arr[index])
                    return false;
                index++;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
