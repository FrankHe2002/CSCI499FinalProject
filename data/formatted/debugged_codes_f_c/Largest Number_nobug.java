Bug Type: Syntax Error and Logic Error

Bug Explanation: 
1. The first bug in the code is a missing semicolon at the end of the statement `result += c` in the loop. This causes a syntax error.
2. The second bug is a logic error. The code incorrectly checks for even numbers using the condition `num % 2 == 1`. This condition identifies odd numbers instead of even numbers.

Fixing the Bugs: 
1. To fix the syntax error, we need to add a semicolon at the end of the statement `result += c` in the loop.
2. To fix the logic error, we need to change the condition `num % 2 == 1` to `num % 2 == 0` to correctly identify even numbers.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
            result += c;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
