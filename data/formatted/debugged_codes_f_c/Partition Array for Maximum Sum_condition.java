Buggy Code Explanation:
The `maxSumAfterPartitioning` method attempts to find the maximum sum of `k` non-overlapping subarrays of `arr`. The code uses a memoization approach to store previously computed results. However, there are a few bugs in the code.

1. In the `maxSum` method, the loop condition `i < arr.length` should be `i < arr.length - 1` to avoid an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Since the loop code accesses `arr[i+1]`, the loop needs to stop at the second-to-last element of the array.

2. In the `maxSum` method, the line `int tempk = 0, half1 = 0, half2 = 0, temp = 0;` initializes `temp` as 0, which is incorrect. The variable `temp` should be initialized as `Integer.MAX_VALUE` so that it can be properly compared in the subsequent loop.

3. In the `maxSum` method, the line `if (temp > half1 + half2) { temp = half1 + half2; }` is incorrect. The condition should be `if (half1 + half2 < tempk) { tempk = half1 + half2; }` so that the minimum value is correctly tracked.

4. In the `maxSum` method, the line `max = (curr1 < curr2) ? curr2 : curr1;` is incorrect. The condition should be `max = Math.max(curr1, curr2);` to properly determine the maximum value.

5. In the `findMaxSumWithKEle` method, the line `if (end > arr.length || end < 0) { return 0; }` is incorrect. The condition should be `if (end >= arr.length || end < 0) { return 0; }` to handle the case when `end` is equal to `arr.length`.

Bug Fixes:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSumAfterPartitioning(int[] arr, int k) {
        return maxSum(arr, k, 0);
    }

    public int maxSum(int[] arr, int k, int start) {
        int curr1 = 0, curr2 = 0;
        int prev = 0;
        int max = 0;

        Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
