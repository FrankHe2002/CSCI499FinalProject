Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process: The buggy code has a logic error in the `back` and `forward` methods. 

In the `back` method, if the number of steps exceeds the current position, it sets the current position to 0 instead of going back steps number of times.

In the `forward` method, if the sum of steps and the current position exceeds the size of the history list, it sets the current position to the last index instead of going forward steps number of times.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions in both methods to correctly handle going back and forward by the specified number of steps.

Fixed code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class BrowserHistory {
    int current;
    ArrayList<String> history;

    public BrowserHistory(String homepage) {
        this.history = new ArrayList<>();
        history.add(homepage);
        this.current = 0;
    }

    public void visit(String url) {
        while (history.size() - 1 > current) {
            history.remove(history.size() - 1);
        }
        history.add(url);
        current++;
    }

    public String back(int steps) {
        if (steps >= current) {
            current = 0;
        } else {
            current -= steps;
        }
        return history.get(current);
    }

    public String forward(int steps) {
        if (steps + current >= history.size() - 1) {
            current = history.size() - 1;
        } else {
            current += steps;
        }
        return history.get(current);
    }
}
```

Note: I made a slight modification to the condition in the `forward` method to ensure that if the sum of steps and the current position exceeds the size of the history list, the current position is set to the last index.
