Bug Type: logical error

Reasoning Process:
The purpose of this code is to remove duplicates from a sorted array and return the length of the updated array. The code uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate through the array. Pointer `i` points to the last non-duplicate element, and pointer `j` iterates through the array to find new elements.

Upon careful review, it is evident that the condition `arr[i] != arr[j]` is incorrect. This condition checks if the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the last non-duplicate element `arr[i]`. However, the correct condition should check if `arr[j]` is not equal to the previous element (i.e., `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]`).

Additionally, the code does not handle the case when the array has only one element. In this case, it should return 1.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] arr) {
        if (arr.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int i = 1;
        for (int j = 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            if (arr[j] != arr[j - 1]) {
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                i++;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```
