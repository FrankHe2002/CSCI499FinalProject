Bug type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning: In the provided buggy code, the loop in line 13, `for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)`, iterates from 0 to `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of columns in the `grid` array. Inside the loop, there is an if-else condition that modifies the `dp` array. In the else condition, `dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j], dp[j - 1]) + grid[i][j];`, it tries to access the `dp[j - 1]` element. The first iteration of this loop, when `j` is 0, results in trying to access `dp[-1]`, which causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix: To fix this bug, we need to check if `j` is greater than 0 before accessing `dp[j - 1]`. If `j` is 0, we only need to add `grid[i][j]` to `dp[j]`, without comparing it with `dp[j - 1]`.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = grid[0][0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + grid[0][i];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (j == 0)
                    dp[j] += grid[i][j];
                else
                    dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j], dp[j - 1]) + grid[i][j];
            }
        }

        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```
