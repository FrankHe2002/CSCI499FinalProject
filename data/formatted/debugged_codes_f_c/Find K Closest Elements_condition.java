Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 

The code is intended to find the `k` closest elements in the `arr` array to the given target `x`. However, the logic used to calculate the starting and ending indices of the sublist is incorrect.

Initially, the range used to iterate (`high - low`) should be greater than or equal to `k` to continue iterating and adding elements to the result sublist. However, the current condition `high - low >= k` ensures that the range is greater than `k`, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the condition `Math.abs(arr[low] - x) < Math.abs(arr[high] - x)` is used to determine whether to increment `low` or decrement `high`. However, this condition ignores the relative distances between `x` and the elements at `low` and `high`. It only considers the absolute differences. This can lead to incorrect results when the elements are ordered in a way that doesn't follow the absolute differences.

To fix this bug, the logic for iterating and adding elements to the result sublist needs to be modified. We need to ensure that `high - low + 1` is greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, we should compare the absolute differences between `x` and the middle elements at `low` and `high` to accurately determine which index to increment or decrement.

Fix:

```java
// Runtime: 12 ms (Top 71.99%) | Memory: 62.2 MB (Top 47.09%)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findClosestElements(int[] arr, int k, int x) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        int low = 0, high = arr.length - k;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (Math.abs(arr[mid] - x) > Math.abs(arr[mid + k] - x)) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        for (int i = low; i < low + k; i++) {
            result.add(arr[i]);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

The fix modifies the starting index from `0` to `low` and the ending index from `arr.length - 1` to `low + k - 1`. This ensures that the range of indices iterated (`low + k - 1
