Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The bug in the provided code is in the `truncateSentence` method. The method is supposed to truncate a given sentence `s` by removing all words after the `k`-th word. However, the implementation currently checks for spaces and counts the number of spaces encountered. This means that the count will not accurately represent the number of words, as there may be multiple spaces between words or at the end of the sentence.

To fix this, we need to modify the approach to count the number of words instead of spaces. We can split the sentence into an array of words using the `.split(" ")` method, and then check if the number of words exceeds or equals `k`. If it does, we can join the first `k` words using the `.join(" ")` method and return the truncated sentence.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String truncateSentence(String s, int k) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        if (words.length >= k) {
            return String.join(" ", Arrays.copyOfRange(words, 0, k));
        }
        return s;
    }
}
```
