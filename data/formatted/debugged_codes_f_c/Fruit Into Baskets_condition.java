Bug type: Logical error and missing increment of `start` variable.

Reasoning process:
1. The code aims to find the length of the longest subarray with at most 2 different elements (`fruits` represent different types of fruits on trees).
2. The `while` loop iterates through the `fruits` array and maintains a sliding window with at most 2 different types of fruits.
3. The bug lies in the condition `map.size() > 2` where it checks if the number of unique types of fruits in the sliding window is greater than 2.
4. If the condition is true, it finds the leftmost index of the fruits and updates the `start` variable to its next index.
5. However, after setting the new value of `start`, the code fails to increment the `end` variable, causing an infinite loop.
6. Additionally, the code does not handle the case when the window reaches the end of the array (`end == fruits.length`) but still has 2 types of fruits. In this case, the maximum length is not updated correctly.

```java

class Solution {
    public int totalFruit(int[] fruits) {
        if (fruits == null || fruits.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int start = 0, end = 0, res = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); //key = type of fruit on tree, value = last index / newest index of that fruit

        while (end < fruits.length) {
            if (map.size() < 2) {
                map.put(fruits[end], end);
                end++;
            } else if (map.size() == 2 && !map.containsKey(fruits[end])) {
                int leftMost = fruits.length;
                for (int num : map.values()) {
                    leftMost = Math.min(leftMost, num);
                }
                map.remove(fruits[leftMost]);
                start = leftMost + 1;
            } else {
                end++;
            }

            res = Math.max(res, end - start);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
