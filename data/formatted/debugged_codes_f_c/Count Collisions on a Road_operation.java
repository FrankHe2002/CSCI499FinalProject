Bug Type: Syntax Error, Logic Error

Reasoning: 
1. The first bug in the provided code is a syntax error at line 4 where the division operator `/` is used in `directions.length() / 1`. It seems like this division operator was intended to be a multiplication operator `*`.
2. The second bug in the provided code is a logic error in the loop condition for the `right` variable. The condition `right >= 0` should be `right > 0` to ensure that the index doesn't go out of bounds when initializing `right` as `directions.length() - 1`. 

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countCollisions(String directions) {
        int left = 0, right = directions.length() - 1;

        while (left < directions.length() && directions.charAt(left) == 'L') {
            left++;
        }

        while (right > 0 && directions.charAt(right) == 'R') {
            right--;
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (directions.charAt(i) != 'S') {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countCollisions(String directions) {
        int left = 0, right = directions.length() - 1;

        while (left < directions.length() && directions.charAt(left) == 'L') {
            left++;
        }

        while (right > 0 && directions.charAt(right) == 'R') {
            right--;
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (directions.charAt(i) != 'S') {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
