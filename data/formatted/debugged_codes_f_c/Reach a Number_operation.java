Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 
1. The `reachNumber` method has two while loops that increment `sum` and `steps`.
2. The first while loop increments `sum` by `steps` until `sum` becomes greater than or equal to `target`.
3. The second while loop increments `sum` and `steps` until `(sum - target) % 2` evaluates to 0.
4. The goal of the method is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach `target` by incrementing or decrementing `steps`.
5. The bug is in the second while loop's condition. The condition should check if `(sum - target)` is divisible by 2, indicating that `target` can be reached by flipping signs of some `steps`.
6. However, the condition `((sum - target) % 2 != 0)` checks if `(sum - target)` is not divisible by 2, which can prevent the loop from terminating even if `target` is reached.
7. The bug can cause an infinite loop if `target` is reachable.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        int sum = 0, steps = 0;
        if (target == 0) return 0;
        target = Math.abs(target);
        while (sum < target) {
            steps++;
            sum += steps;
        }

        while (((sum - target) % 2 != 0) || (sum < target)) {
            steps++;
            sum += steps;
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
```
