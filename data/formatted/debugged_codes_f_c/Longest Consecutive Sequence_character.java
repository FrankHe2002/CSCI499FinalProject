The bug in the provided code is a syntax error. In the second while loop, there is a missing closing parenthesis `)`. Also, the code uses a variable `storage` which is not declared or imported. 

To fix the bug, we need to import the `HashSet` and `Set` classes from the `java.util` package, and we also need to close the opening parenthesis in the second while loop.

Additionally, the code uses `tempL` to track the length of the consecutive sequence, but it should be initialized as 0 instead of 1, as 1 would count the current element by default.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> storage = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            storage.add(nums[i]);
        }

        int maxL = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (storage.contains(nums[i])) {
                storage.remove(nums[i]);

                int dec = nums[i] - 1;
                int inc = nums[i] + 1;
                int tempL = 0;

                while (storage.contains(dec)) {
                    storage.remove(dec);
                    dec--;
                    tempL++;
                }

                while (storage.contains(inc)) {
                    storage.remove(inc);
                    inc++;
                    tempL++;
                }

                maxL = Math.max(maxL, tempL);
            }
        }

        return maxL;
    }
}
```
