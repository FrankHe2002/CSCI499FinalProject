Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 

The provided code is designed to find the first repeated character in a given string. The bug is a logical error in how the code determines if a character is repeated. 

The code uses a HashSet to keep track of characters encountered so far. For each character in the input string, it checks if the HashSet contains the character. If it does, it returns the character as the first repeated character. If not, it adds the character to the HashSet. 

However, the code incorrectly returns the character as soon as it finds a character that is already in the HashSet. This logic doesn't guarantee that the returned character is the first repeated character in the string. It only guarantees that it is a repeated character, potentially not the first one. 

To fix this bug, we need to keep track of the first repeated character encountered in the string and return it outside the loop if found. 

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public char repeatedCharacter(String s) {
        HashSet<Character> hset = new HashSet<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (hset.contains(ch))
                return ch;
            else
                hset.add(ch);
        }
        return ' ';
    }
}
```
