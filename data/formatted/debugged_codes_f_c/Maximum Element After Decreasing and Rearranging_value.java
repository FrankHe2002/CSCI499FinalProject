Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the provided code lies in the loop condition `i < arr.length`. Since the loop starts from index 2 (`i = 2`), it should iterate until `i <= arr.length` rather than `i < arr.length`. This is necessary to ensure that the last element of the array is also checked for the condition inside the loop. Additionally, the code is missing an import statement for the `Arrays` class, which is required for `Arrays.sort(arr)`. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the loop condition to `i <= arr.length` and add the import statement for `java.util.Arrays`.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        arr[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= arr.length; i++) {
            if (Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) > 1)
                arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + 1;
        }
        return arr[arr.length - 1];
    }
}
```
