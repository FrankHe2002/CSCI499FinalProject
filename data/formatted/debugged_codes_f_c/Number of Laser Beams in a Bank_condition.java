Bug Type: Syntax Error, Logical Error.

Reasoning: 
1. The loop condition in the outer loop is incorrect. It should be `i < bank.length` instead of `i > bank.length`. The loop condition should ensure that `i` is within the valid range of indices for the `bank` array.
2. There is an extra semicolon (`;`) after `ans += pre * n;`. This is a syntax error and should be removed.
3. The calculation of `ans` in `ans += pre * n;` seems to have a logical error. The correct calculation should be `ans += pre + n;` instead of multiplication.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfBeams(String[] bank) {
        int ans = 0, pre = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < bank.length; i++) {
            int n = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < bank[i].length(); j++) {
                if (bank[i].charAt(j) == '1') {
                    n++;
                }
            }
            if (n == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            ans += pre + n;
            pre = n;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
