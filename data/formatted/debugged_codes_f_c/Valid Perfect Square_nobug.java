Bug Type: Logical Error

The bug in the provided code is a logical error. The code checks if the square of `mid` is equal to `num`. However, for large inputs, the `mid * mid` operation may overflow the `long` data type. As a result, the condition `mid * mid == num` may produce incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `long` data type for `mid` and compare `mid * mid` with `num`. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `mid * mid` is greater than `num`, which indicates that we need to decrease the range by updating `end = mid - 1`.

Another issue is that the code does not handle the case when `num` is 0. In this case, we should directly return `true` because 0 is a perfect square of itself.

To summarize, the steps to fix the bug are as follows:
1. Add a check for `num == 0` at the beginning of the method and return `true`.
2. Update the data type of `mid` to `long`.
3. Update the comparison `mid * mid == num` to `mid * mid < num`.
4. Update the statement `end = mid - 1` in the `else` block.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            return true;
        }

        long start = 1;
        long end = num;

        while (start <= end) {
            long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (mid * mid == (long) num) {
                return true;
            } else if (mid * mid < num) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
