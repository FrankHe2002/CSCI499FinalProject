Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided buggy code attempts to find the maximum number of elements that can be removed from string `s` such that it remains a subsequence of string `p`. The approach uses binary search to find the maximum number of removable elements.

In the `maximumRemovals` method, the main bug lies in the termination condition of the `while` loop. The loop should continue while `left < right`, but the termination condition is reversed (`left >= right`). This can result in the loop not executing even when there are more removals possible, or in an infinite loop when `left` and `right` are equal.

Another potential issue is the calculation of the `middle` index. The correct calculation should be `(right + left) / 2` instead of `(right + left + 1) / 2`. The latter calculation rounds up the middle index, which can cause incorrect results in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, the termination condition of the `while` loop needs to be corrected to `left < right` and the calculation of the `middle` index needs to be updated to `(right + left) / 2`.

Buggy Code Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumRemovals(String s, String p, int[] removable) {
        int left = 0, right = removable.length;

        while (left < right) {
            int middle = (right + left) / 2;
            String afterRemoval = remove(s, removable, middle);
            if (isSubsequence(p, afterRemoval, p.length(), afterRemoval.length()))
                left = middle + 1;
            else
                right = middle;
        }

        return left;
    }

    private String remove(String s, int[] removable, int k) {
        char[] symbols = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            symbols[removable[i]] = Character.MIN_VALUE;
        }
        return String.valueOf(symbols);
    }

    private boolean isSubsequence(String subSequence, String word, int subSequenceChar, int wordChar) {
        if (subSequenceChar == 0) return true;
        if (wordChar == 0) return false;

        if (subSequence.charAt(subSequenceChar - 1) == word.charAt(wordChar - 1))
            return isSubsequence(subSequence, word, subSequenceChar - 1, wordChar - 1);
