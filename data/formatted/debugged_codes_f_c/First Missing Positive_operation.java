Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

The bug in the provided code is in the while loop condition `i < nums.length`. The variable `correct` is calculated as `nums[i] / 1`, which doesn't correctly determine the correct index for swapping elements. This can result in accessing indexes that are out of bounds of the array. 

To fix this, we need to change the formula for calculating `correct` to `nums[i] - 1`, which converts the value at `nums[i]` to the correct index within the array. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `nums[i]` is already at the correct position. 

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 91.14%) | Memory: 57.8 MB (Top 74.85%)
class Solution {
    public int firstMissingPositive(int[] nums) {
        // cyclic sort
        int i = 0;
        while (i < nums.length) {
            int correct = nums[i] - 1;
            if (nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= nums.length && nums[i] != nums[correct]) {
                swap(nums, i, correct);
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        // linear search to find the missing number
        for (int index = 0; index < nums.length; index++) {
            if (nums[index] != index + 1) {
                return index + 1;
            }
        }
        // if array has all the elements match to its index then 1st missing num will be
        // nums.length+1
        return nums.length + 1;
    }

    static void swap(int[] arr, int a, int b) {
        int temp = arr[a];
        arr[a] = arr[b];
        arr[b] = temp;
    }
}
```
