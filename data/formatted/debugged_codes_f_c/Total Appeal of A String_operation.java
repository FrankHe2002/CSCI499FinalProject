Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The provided buggy code calculates the appeal sum of a given string. It iterates through each character in the string, calculates a value based on the character's position, and stores the last position of each character for future calculations. However, there is a logical error in the calculation of the appeal sum.

The formula used to calculate the appeal sum is incorrect. It multiplies `(i + prev)` with `(n - i)` and adds it to the result. This formula does not accurately calculate the appeal sum according to the provided problem description.

To fix this, the correct formula for calculating the appeal sum needs to be implemented.

Bug Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 9 ms (Top 66.9%) | Memory: 43.90 MB (Top 92.4%)

class Solution {
    public long appealSum(String s) {
        long res = 0;
        char[] cs = s.toCharArray();
        int n = cs.length;
        int[] pos = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(pos, - 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int j = cs[i] - 'a';
            res += (i - pos[j]) * (n - i);
            pos[j] = i;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
In the fixed code, the formula for calculating the appeal sum is adjusted. Instead of `(i + prev)` in the formula, it is changed to `(i - pos[j])`, which represents the distance between the current position `i` and the last position of the character `j`. This formula correctly calculates the appeal sum as specified in the problem description.
