Bug Type in Buggy Code:
The bug type in the buggy code is a logical error. The original code does not correctly handle the conditions to determine whether a number is a multiple of 3 and/or 5.

Reasoning Process for Identifying and Fixing the Bug:
To identify the bug, we can analyze the conditions for determining "Fizz" and "Buzz" in the original code. We can observe that the conditions `fizz == 3` and `buzz == 5` are incorrect in identifying numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5, respectively. For example, when `fizz` becomes 3, it is not true that the current number is a multiple of 3. Similarly, when `buzz` becomes 5, it is not true that the current number is a multiple of 5. These conditions need to be changed to `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 5 == 0` to correctly identify multiples of 3 and 5.

Additionally, the initial values of `fizz` and `buzz` should be set to 0 instead of 1 for the conditions to work correctly.

Fixing the Bug in the Buggy Code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        List<String> l = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 1, fizz = 0, buzz = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            fizz++;
            buzz++;

            if (fizz == 3 && buzz == 5) {
                l.add("FizzBuzz");
                fizz = 0;
                buzz = 0;
            } else if (fizz == 3) {
                l.add("Fizz");
                fizz = 0;
            } else if (buzz == 5) {
                l.add("Buzz");
                buzz = 0;
            } else {
                l.add(String.valueOf(i));
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        List<String> l = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 1, fizz = 0, buzz = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            fizz++;
            buzz++;

            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
