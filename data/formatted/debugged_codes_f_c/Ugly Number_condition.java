The bug type in the provided code is a logical error. 

Reasoning process:
1. The while loop condition is `n == 1`, which should be `n != 1`.
2. The current condition checks if `n` is divisible by 2, 3, or 5, and if not, it returns `false`. However, this check should be performed until `n` becomes 1, not when it is already 1. So, the condition needs to be changed to `while (n != 1)`.
3. Inside the loop, when `n` is divisible by any of the numbers (2, 3, or 5), it should continue dividing `n` by that number until it is no longer divisible. This can be achieved by replacing the `if` statements with `while` loops.
4. Lastly, the division operation (`n = n / x`) can be simplified to an integer division (`n /= x`) for brevity.

    public boolean isUgly(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return false; // edge case
        }
        while (n != 1) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                n /= 2;
            } else if (n % 3 == 0) {
                n /= 3;
            } else if (n % 5 == 0) {
                n /= 5;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
