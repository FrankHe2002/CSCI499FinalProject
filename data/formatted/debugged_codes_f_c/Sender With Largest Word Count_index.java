The buggy code contains several bugs:

1. Index Out of Bounds Exception: The loop condition `i < messages.length` attempts to access `messages[i + 2]`. However, this goes out of bounds since `i` can reach the last index of `messages`. The fix is to change the loop condition to `i < messages.length - 2` to avoid accessing indices beyond the array's bounds.
2. NullPointerException: The code initializes a `HashMap` `hm` but does not include the necessary import statement `import java.util.HashMap;`. Adding the import statement at the beginning of the file fixes this issue.
3. NullPointerException: The code attempts to retrieve a value from the `HashMap` using `hm.getOrDefault(senders[i], 0)`. However, this call may return null because `hm` has not been initialized with default values for all possible keys in `senders`. The fix is to initialize `hm` with the default values beforehand.
4. NullPointerException: The code attempts to retrieve a value from the `HashMap` using `hm.get(senders[i])`. However, this can result in a null value if the key does not exist in `hm`. The fix is to first check if `hm.containsKey(senders[i])` before retrieving the value using `hm.get(senders[i])`.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the code could be optimized by using a `StringBuilder` when concatenating the `name` variable. However, since the question specifically asks not to optimize the code, we will keep it as it is.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public String largestWordCount(String[] messages, String[] senders) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();

        int max = 0;
        String name = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < messages.length - 2; i++) {
            String[] words = messages[i + 2].split(" ");

            int freq = hm.getOrDefault(senders[i], 0) + words.length;
            hm.put(senders[i], freq);

            if (!hm.containsKey(senders[i])) {
                hm.put(senders[i], freq);
            } else {
                int currentFreq = hm.get(senders[i]);
                if (currentFreq > max) {
                    max = currentFreq;
                    name = senders[i];
                } else if (currentFreq == max && name.compareTo(senders[i]) < 0) {
                    name = senders
