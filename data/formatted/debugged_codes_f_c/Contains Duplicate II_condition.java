Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: In the provided code, the condition `(Math.abs(map.get(nums[i]) - i) > k)` is used to determine if the difference between the current index and the previous occurrence of the number exceeds the given threshold `k`. However, this condition is incorrect. It should check if the difference is less than or equal to `k` in order to satisfy the requirement of "containing nearby duplicates". The current condition incorrectly checks if the difference is greater than `k`, which does not fulfill the intended logic.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(nums[i]) && (Math.abs(map.get(nums[i]) - i) <= k)) {
                return true;
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
