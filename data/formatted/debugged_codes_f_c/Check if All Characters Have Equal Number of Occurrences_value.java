Bug Type: Array index out of bounds

Reasoning: Looking at the provided code, the issue occurs when accessing the `freq` array. The `freq` array has a length of 27, but it is accessed using indices `s.charAt(i) - 'a'`, which assumes that the characters in `s` are lowercase letters corresponding to ASCII values from 97 to 122. However, if `s` contains any character outside this range, an out-of-bounds exception will occur.

Fix: To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the indices used to access the `freq` array are within its valid bounds. We can accomplish this by adjusting the index calculation to handle all possible characters. In this case, we will assume that `s` can contain any printable character.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areOccurrencesEqual(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[256]; // Assuming all printable characters

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) freq[s.charAt(i)]++;

        int val = freq[s.charAt(0)];
        for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++)
            if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != val) return false;

        return true;
    }
}
```
