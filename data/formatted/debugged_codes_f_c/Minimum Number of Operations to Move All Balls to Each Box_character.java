Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The code has a syntax error in the method signature. The return type of the method is written as `int]` instead of `int[]`, which leads to a compilation error. To fix this, the closing square bracket `]` needs to be moved after the `int`.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 135 ms (Top 50.7%) | Memory: 44.02 MB (Top 24.4%)

class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length();
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int t = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                char c = boxes.charAt(j);
                if (c == '1') t += Math.abs(i - j);
            }
            ans[i] = t;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
