Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The provided code is for finding the kth smallest distance between pairs of numbers in the given array `nums`. The code uses binary search to find the smallest distance. However, there is a logical error in the `noOfDistancesLessThan` method. The condition `nums[j] - nums[i] <= dist` should be `nums[j] - nums[i] < dist` to count the number of distances less than `dist`. The current condition includes distances equal to `dist`, which is incorrect.

Fix:
Change the condition `nums[j] - nums[i] <= dist` to `nums[j] - nums[i] < dist` in the `noOfDistancesLessThan` method.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestDistancePair(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int low = 0, high = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (noOfDistancesLessThan(mid, nums) >= k) high = mid - 1;
            else low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }

    private int noOfDistancesLessThan(int dist, int[] nums) {
        int count = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < nums.length) {
            while (j < nums.length && nums[j] - nums[i] < dist) {  // fixed the condition
                j++;
            }
            count += j - i - 1;
            i++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
