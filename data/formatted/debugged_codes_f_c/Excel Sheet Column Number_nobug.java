Bug Type: Numeric Logic Error

Reasoning: 

The provided code has a logical error in the calculation of the result. The formula `(c - 64) * Math.pow(26, pow)` is incorrect for converting the column title to a corresponding number.

To fix this, we need to revise the formula to convert each character to its corresponding numeric value. The characters 'A' to 'Z' have numeric values starting from 1 to 26. 

To calculate the numeric value of a character, we can subtract 'A' from it and add 1. The formula `(c - 'A' + 1)` will give us the correct numeric value for the character.

Additionally, since the formula `(c - 'A' + 1)` already calculates the value of the current character, we don't need to use `Math.pow(26, pow)` for updating the result. Instead, we can multiply the current result by 26 and add the value of the current character.

This will result in a fixed implementation of the `titleToNumber` method.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 81.25%) | Memory: 42.4 MB (Top 81.68%)
class Solution {
    public int titleToNumber(String columnTitle) {
        int n = columnTitle.length();
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = columnTitle.charAt(i);
            res = res * 26 + (c - 'A' + 1);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
