Bug Type: Inconsistent Handling of Carry

Explanation: The bug in the code is that it doesn't handle the final carry correctly if it's greater than 0. In the current code, the final carry is appended to the StringBuilder (`sb.append(carry)`) only if it is less than or equal to 0. However, this condition is incorrect because the carry value can be greater than 0 in some cases. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if (carry > 0)` so that the final carry is added to the StringBuilder if it is greater than 0.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String addBinary(String a, String b) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int carry = 0;
        int i = a.length() - 1;
        int j = b.length() - 1;
        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
            int sum = carry;
            if (i >= 0)
                sum += a.charAt(i--) - '0';
            if (j >= 0)
                sum += b.charAt(j--) - '0';
            sb.append(sum % 2);
            carry = sum / 2;
        }
        if (carry > 0) // Fix: Changed condition to check if carry is greater than 0
            sb.append(carry);
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
