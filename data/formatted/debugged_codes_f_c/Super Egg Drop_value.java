The bug in the provided code is that it causes a "Time Limit Exceeded" error (TLE) for large inputs. This means that the code takes too long to execute and does not produce a result within the allowed time limit.

To fix the TLE issue, we will make use of memoization (dynamic programming) to store the calculated values instead of recalculating them every time. We will modify the code to include the memoization array `dp` and update the `solve` method to check if the value for the current state has already been calculated before recursively solving further.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int[][] dp;

    public int superEggDrop(int k, int n) {
        dp = new int[k + 1][n + 1];
        return solve(k, n);
    }

    public int solve(int e, int f) {
        if (f == 0 || f == 1) {
            return f;
        }

        if (e == 1) {
            return f;
        }

        if (dp[e][f] != 0) {
            return dp[e][f];
        }

        int high = f;
        int low = 1;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        while (low <= high) {
            int k = low + (high - low) / 2;

            int l = 0;
            int r = 0;

            if (dp[e - 1][k - 1] != 0) {
                l = dp[e - 1][k - 1];
            } else {
                l = solve(e - 1, k - 1);
                dp[e - 1][k - 1] = l;
            }

            if (dp[e][f - k] != 0) {
                r = dp[e][f - k];
            } else {
                r = solve(e, f - k);
                dp[e][f - k] = r;
            }

            if (l > r) {
                high = k - 1;
            } else {
                low = k + 1;
            }

            int temp = Math.max(l, r) + 1;
            min = Math.min(min, temp);
        }

        return dp[e][f] = min;
    }
}
```

By introducing memoization and storing the already calculated values in the `dp` array, we eliminate the redundant recursive
