Bug Explanation:
The main bug in the provided code occurs in the innermost loop where the variable `k` starts from `i + 1`. Since `k` can be equal to `j` in some cases, this implementation doesn't handle the case where the characters at positions `i` and `j` are equal. This results in an incorrect calculation of the value for `dp[i][j]`.

Additionally, the code doesn't handle the base case for `l == 1`, which is necessary to populate the `dp` array properly.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to make the following changes to the code:
1. Add a base case for `l == 1`. Set `dp[i][i]` to 1 to represent printing a single character.
2. Adjust the innermost loop condition to include the case where `k == j`. This ensures that the correct values are compared and updated in the case where the characters at positions `i` and `j` are equal.

Here is the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {

    public int strangePrinter(String s) {
        if (s.equals("")) return 0;
        int len = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[len][len];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        }
        for (int l = 2; l <= len; l++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < len && l + i - 1 < len; i++) {
                int j = l + i - 1;
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1;
                for (int k = i + 1; k <= j; k++) {
                    if (s.charAt(k) == s.charAt(j)) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k - 1] + dp[k][j + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][len - 1];
    }
}
```

The fixed code correctly calculates the minimum number of times the printer needs to print to obtain a string representation of the input string `s`.
