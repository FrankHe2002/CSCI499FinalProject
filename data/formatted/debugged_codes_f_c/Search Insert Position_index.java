The provided buggy Java code is implementing a binary search algorithm to find the target element in the given array. However, there are several bugs in the code.

Bug #1:
```
if (target < nums[2]) {
```
In this line of code, instead of checking the target against the middle element `nums[mid]`, it mistakenly uses the index `2`. This will cause incorrect comparisons and incorrect assignments to the `end` variable. The fix is to change it to `if (target < nums[mid])`.

Bug #2:
```
if (target > nums[mid]) {
```
In this line of code, the condition is correct, but it should be an `else if` statement instead of an `if` statement. Currently, it can execute this condition even after finding a match in the previous condition, which is incorrect. The fix is to change it to `else if (target > nums[mid])`.

Bug #3:
```
return start;
```
In the final return statement, the code should return `mid` instead of `start`. This statement should only execute if the target element is not found in the array. The fix is to change it to `return mid`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (target < nums[mid]) {
                end = mid - 1;
            } else if (target > nums[mid]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return -1; // or any appropriate value when target is not found
    }
}
```
