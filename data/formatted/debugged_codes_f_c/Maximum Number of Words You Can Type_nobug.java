Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The bug type in the provided buggy code is a logical error. The code is intended to count the number of words in the `text` string that can be typed, given the `brokenLetters` string. However, the logic used to determine if a word can be typed is incorrect.

In the original code, the variable `count` is initialized to 1 to account for the first word. Then, for each character `c` in the `text` string, the code checks if `c` is a space (' ') indicating the end of a word. If it is a space, `isBad` is reset to false and `count` is incremented to account for the next word.

If `c` is not a space, the code checks if `isBad` is false (indicating that the current word has not been marked as untypeable) and if the character `c` is present in the `brokenLetters` string. If both conditions are true, `isBad` is set to true and `count` is decremented to exclude the current word from the count.

The logical error occurs because the code only checks if a character is present in `brokenLetters` once and marks the entire word as untypeable based on that check. However, if there are multiple occurrences of the same broken letter within a word, the word could still be typeable if the broken letters are not consecutive.

In addition, the initialization of `count` to 1 is incorrect because it doesn't consider the case where the first word is untypeable due to broken letters.

To fix the bug and account for multiple occurrences of broken letters within a word, the code should check each character in the word individually and exclude the word from the count only if all of its characters are present in `brokenLetters` consecutively.

        boolean isBad = false;
        for (String word : words) {
            isBad = false;
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                if (brokenLetters.indexOf(c) != -1) {
                    isBad = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
