Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The bug in the given code is a logical error in calculating the overlap between the two rectangles. The condition `if (x2 > x1 && y2 > y1)` checks if there is an overlap, but it should check if there is no overlap. If there is an overlap, the code should subtract the overlapped area from the total area. Additionally, the variable names `R1` and `R2` are not descriptive and should be changed.

Fix:
- Change the condition in the if statement to `if (x2 > x1 && y2 > y1)` to `if (x2 > x1 && y2 > y1)`
- Change the variable names `R1` and `R2` to `area1` and `area2`, respectively, for clarity

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 5 ms (Top 35.02%) | Memory: 42.9 MB (Top 64.28%)
class Solution {
    public int computeArea(int ax1, int ay1, int ax2, int ay2, int bx1, int by1, int bx2, int by2) {
        int x1 = Math.max(ax1, bx1);
        int y1 = Math.max(ay1, by1);
        int x2 = Math.min(ax2, bx2);
        int y2 = Math.min(ay2, by2);

        int area = 0;
        int area1 = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1);
        int area2 = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1);
        area = area1 + area2;

        if (x2 > x1 && y2 > y1) {
            int overlap = (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1);
            area = area - overlap;
        }

        return area;
    }
}
```
