Bug type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning process:
1. The code attempts to access the element at index `i + 2` in the array `a`, which is out of bounds.
2. The array `a` has a length of `n`, so its indices range from 0 to `n - 1`.
3. The loop iterates through the indices of `a` with the variable `i`.
4. When `i + 2` is equal to `n`, it exceeds the valid range of indices.

Fix:
1. Change `a[i + 2]` to `a[i]` in the line `a[i + 2] += k;`.
2. This change ensures that the candies are distributed to the correct person.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {
        int n = num_people;
        int a[] = new int[n];
        int k = 1;
        while (candies > 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (candies >= k) {
                    a[i] += k;
                    candies -= k;
                    k++;
                } else {
                    a[i] += candies;
                    candies = 0;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
