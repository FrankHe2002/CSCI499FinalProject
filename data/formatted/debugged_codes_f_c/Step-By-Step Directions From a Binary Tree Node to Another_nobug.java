Bug Type:
This buggy code has a logical error.

Reasoning:
In the `DFS` method, the code appends "L" to the `path` if the DFS on the left child returns `true`. However, this does not handle the case where the DFS on the right child also returns `true`. Similarly, if the DFS on the right child returns `true`, the code appends "R" to the `path` without checking if the DFS on the left child returns `true`.

Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `DFS` method to handle both cases. We can introduce two boolean variables, `foundInLeft` and `foundInRight`, to keep track of whether the destination value was found in the left or right child. We can also modify the return type of the `DFS` method to be `void`, as we no longer need to return a boolean value.

In the modified `DFS` method, if the destination value is found in the left child, we set `foundInLeft` to `true` and append "L" to the `path`. If the destination value is found in the right child, we set `foundInRight` to `true` and append "R" to the `path`.

Finally, in the `getDirections` method, we need to check both `foundInLeft` and `foundInRight` after calling the `DFS` method for both the start and destination values. We can then construct the final path using the `foundInLeft` and `foundInRight` variables.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {

    private void DFS(TreeNode currNode, StringBuilder path, int destVal, boolean[] found) {
        if (currNode == null) return;
        if (currNode.val == destVal) {
            found[0] = true;
            return;
        }
        if (!found[0]) {
            DFS(currNode.left, path.append("L"), destVal, found);
        }
        if (!found[0]) {
            DFS(currNode.right, path.append("R"), destVal, found);
        }
        if (!found[0]) {
            path.deleteCharAt(path.length() - 1);
        }
    }

    public String getDirections(TreeNode root, int startValue, int destValue) {
        StringBuilder startToRoot = new StringBuilder();
        StringBuilder endToRoot = new StringBuilder();
        boolean[] startFound = new boolean[1];
        boolean[] destFound
