Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: 

1. The syntax error is indicated by the missing closing curly brace (`}`) after the inner for loop.
2. The code attempts to iterate over the array `nums` and count the occurrences of each number in the range from 1 to `n`.
3. The bug results in a syntax error because the closing curly brace is missing, causing a compilation error.

Fix: Add the missing closing curly brace (`}`) after the inner for loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int dup = 0, miss = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == i) count++;
            }

            if (count == 2) dup = i;
            if (count == 0) miss = i;
        }

        return new int[] {dup, miss};
    }
}
```
