Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning: 
The original code initializes the variable `answer` to 0 and increments it by 1 in each iteration of the loop until `answer * answer <= x` is no longer true. However, the loop condition should be `answer * answer < x` because we want to find the largest whole number whose square is less than `x`. The incorrect loop condition causes the loop to terminate one iteration too late, resulting in the incorrect value of `answer`. Additionally, when returning the result, the code subtracts 1 from `answer`, which is unnecessary because `answer` has already been incremented beyond the correct value.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        long answer = 0;
        while (answer * answer < x) {
            answer += 1;
        }
        return (int) answer;
    }
}
```
