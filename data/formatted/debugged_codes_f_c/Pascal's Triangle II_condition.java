Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning: Within the `getRow` method, the `out` list is initialized as an empty `ArrayList`. However, in the inner loop, the code attempts to access values from `out` using the index `i - 1`, which is out of bounds since `out` is empty. This leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
 
Fix: To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `out` list with at least one element before entering the outer loop. We can add the following line before the outer loop:
```java
out.add(new ArrayList<>());
```
Additionally, we also need to update the loop condition in the outer loop to `i <= rowIndex` instead of `i < rowIndex`, ensuring that the loop runs for `rowIndex` iterations.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 92.46%) | Memory: 41.7 MB (Top 63.33%)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        List<List<Integer>> out = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
            out.add(new ArrayList<>());
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (j == 0 || j == i) {
                    out.get(i).add(1);
                } else {
                    out.get(i).add(out.get(i - 1).get(j - 1) + out.get(i - 1).get(j));
                }

            }
        }
        return out.get(rowIndex);
    }
}
```
