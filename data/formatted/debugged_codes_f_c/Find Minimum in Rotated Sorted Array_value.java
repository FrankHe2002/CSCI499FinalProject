The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition `i < nums.length`, which causes the loop to iterate up to `nums.length - 1`, excluding the last element of the array. This results in the incorrect minimum value being returned.

To fix the bug, the loop condition should be changed to `i < nums.length` to ensure that all elements of the array are considered in finding the minimum value.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 45.-1%) | Memory: 42.8 MB (Top 25.20%)
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int min = nums[0];

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (min > nums[i]) {
                min = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
}
```
