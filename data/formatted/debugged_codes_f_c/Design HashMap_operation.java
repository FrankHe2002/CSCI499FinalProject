Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning: 
1. In the `put` method, if the `map[bucket]` is not null, we iterate through the entries in the linked list to check if the key already exists. However, if the key is found, we update the corresponding value and immediately return without adding a new entry to the linked list. This means that when the same key is encountered again, it will not be found in the linked list and a new entry will be added, resulting in duplicate entries for the same key. This violates the behavior of a HashMap.
2. In the `remove` method, after finding the entry to remove (`toRemove`), we immediately return without removing it from the linked list. This means that the entry will still remain in the linked list, violating the behavior of removing a mapping.

To fix the logic error:
1. In the `put` method, after updating the value of an existing entry, we can return immediately. This avoids adding a duplicate entry.
2. In the `remove` method, after finding the entry to remove, we should break out of the loop and then remove the entry from the linked list.

Fixed code:

```java
class MyHashMap {

    /**
     * Initialize your data structure here.
     */
    LinkedList<Entry>[] map;
    public static int SIZE = 769;

    public MyHashMap() {
        map = new LinkedList[SIZE];
    }

    /**
     * value will always be non-negative.
     */
    public void put(int key, int value) {
        int bucket = key % SIZE;
        if (map[bucket] == null) {
            map[bucket] = new LinkedList<Entry>();
            map[bucket].add(new Entry(key, value));
        } else {
            for (Entry entry : map[bucket]) {
                if (entry.key == key) {
                    entry.val = value;
                    return;
                }
            }
            map[bucket].add(new Entry(key, value));
        }
    }

    /**
     * Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key
     */
    public int get(int key) {
        int bucket = key % SIZE;
        LinkedList<Entry> entries = map[bucket];
        if (entries == null) return -1;
        for (Entry entry : entries) {
            if (entry.key == key) return entry.val;
        }
        return -1;
    }
