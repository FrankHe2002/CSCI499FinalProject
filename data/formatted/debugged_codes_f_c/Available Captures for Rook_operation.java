Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Error

Reasoning: The code attempts to access indices in the `board` array that are outside of its bounds. This bug can be identified by noticing that the loops for `i` and `j` in the original code have a condition of `< 8`, which implies that the `board` array is an 8x8 array. However, in the while loops that check the surrounding cells of the rook, the conditions for `i` and `j` do not account for the bounds of the array correctly. Specifically, in the while loop `while (i <= board.length + 1)`, the condition should be changed to `while (i < board.length - 1)` to ensure the loop does not go beyond the bounds of the array. Similarly, in the while loop `while (j <= board[0].length - 1)`, the condition should be changed to `while (j < board[0].length - 1)` to prevent accessing an out-of-bounds index.

            for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'R') {
                    row = i;
                    col = j;
                    break;

        int j = col;
        while (j >= 0) {
            if (board[row][j] == 'B') {
                break;

                ans++;
                break;
