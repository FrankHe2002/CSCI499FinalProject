Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code aims to determine if a binary tree is complete.
2. The code uses a level order traversal approach to traverse the tree using a queue.
3. The `end` variable is used to keep track of whether a `null` node has been encountered.
4. If a `null` node is encountered after a non-null node, it means the tree is not complete.
5. However, the code incorrectly adds the left and right children of the `currentNode` to the queue even when `currentNode` is `null`.
6. This causes the traversal to proceed incorrectly and leads to incorrect results.

Fix:

To fix the bug, the code needs to add the left and right children to the queue only when `currentNode` is not `null`. This will avoid adding children of `null` nodes to the queue and ensure the correctness of the level order traversal.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 49.17%) | Memory: 42.4 MB (Top 73.50%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root) {
        boolean end = false;
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode currentNode = queue.poll();
            if (currentNode != null) {
                end = true;
                queue.offer(currentNode.left);
                queue.offer(currentNode.right);
            } else {
                if (end) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
