Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The code calculates the minimum perimeter needed to contain a certain number of apples. It uses a variable `n` to iterate and calculate the total number of apples for each iteration. The condition `count < neededApples` is used to continue the loop until the count exceeds the desired number of apples. However, the loop iterates one extra time, resulting in an incorrect final `n` value.

Fix: To fix this issue, we need to modify the loop condition to `count <= neededApples`. This ensures that the loop stops when the count becomes equal to or exceeds the desired number of apples. Additionally, we need to update the return statement to `(n - 1) * 8` to account for the extra iteration.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumPerimeter(long neededApples) {
        long n = 0;
        long count = 0;
        while (count <= neededApples) {
            n++;
            count += (12 * n * n);
        }
        return (n - 1) * 8;
    }
}
```
