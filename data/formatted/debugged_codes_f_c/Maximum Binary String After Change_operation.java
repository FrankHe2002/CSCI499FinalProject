Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 

The code aims to create the maximum possible lexicographically binary string by swapping at most one `0` to the left of all the `1`s in the given binary string. 

However, the logic used in the code fails to achieve the desired result. The code iterates through the given binary string until it encounters the first `0`. From that point onwards, it appends all the subsequent characters as `1` to the `ans` string, including the `0` encountered. And during this process, it also appends all the `1`s to a separate buffer string. Finally, it appends the buffer string to the `ans` string. 

This logic fails because it does not handle the case where there are more than one `0`s after the first `0` encountered. It simply appends them as `1`s to the `ans` string, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to modify the logic to handle the correct maximum binary string formation. One way to achieve this is by counting the number of `1`s after the first encountered `0` and appending that many `1`s to the `ans` string after the initial `0`. By doing so, we ensure that the maximum binary string is formed.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 86.74%) | Memory: 39.2 MB (Top 40.25%)

class Solution {
    public String maximumBinaryString(String binary) {
        int n = binary.length();
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder(binary);
        int onesAfter1stZero = 0;
        boolean found1stZero = false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!found1stZero) {
                if (binary.charAt(i) == '0') {
                    found1stZero = true;
                }
            } else {
                if (binary.charAt(i) == '0') {
                    onesAfter1stZero++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (found1stZero) {
            int index = n - onesAfter1stZero - 1;
            ans.setCharAt(index, '0');
        }
        
        return ans.toString();
    }
}
```
The fixed code counts the number of `1`s occurring after the first `0` rather than appending them directly to the `ans` string. It also handles the case where there are no `0
