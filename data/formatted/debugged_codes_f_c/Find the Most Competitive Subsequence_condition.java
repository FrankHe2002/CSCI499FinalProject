Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning: The original code causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because the condition `j <= 0` in the while loop checks if `j` is less than or equal to 0. However, the correct condition should be `j >= 1` because we want to check if there is at least one element in the stack. Additionally, the condition `j + nums.length - i > k` is incorrect because it allows more elements to be added to the stack than the specified value of `k`. The condition should be `j + nums.length - i > k - 1` to ensure that the stack doesn't exceed the size `k`. 

Fix: The fix involves changing the conditions in the while loop to `j >= 1` and `j + nums.length - i > k - 1`. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] mostCompetitive(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] stack = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            while (j >= 1 && stack[j - 1] > nums[i] && j + nums.length - i > k - 1) {
                j--;
            }
            if (j < k) {
                stack[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return stack;
    }
}
```
