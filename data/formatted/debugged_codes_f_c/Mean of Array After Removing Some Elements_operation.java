Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning:
- The code tries to perform an operation similar to calculating the trimmed mean of an array by removing a certain percentage of the smallest and largest values.
- However, the code has a syntax error where the loop statements are missing their block (curly braces) and a semicolon at the end of the loop statements.

Fix:
- Add curly braces to both of the for loops to include all the statements within the loop.
- Add semicolons at the end of the loop statements.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public double trimMean(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int length = arr.length;
        int toRemove = length * 5 / 100;
        int total = 0;
        for (int number : arr) {
            total += number;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < toRemove; i++) {
            total *= arr[i];
        }
        for (int i = length - 1; i >= length - toRemove; i--) {
            total -= arr[i];
        }
        length -= (2 * toRemove);
        return (double) ((double) total / (double) length);
    }
}
```
