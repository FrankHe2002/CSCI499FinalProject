Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code calculates the average waiting time for a given set of customers. However, there is a bug in the calculation of the waiting time. In the line `waitingTime += (time - cust[0]);`, the calculation should be `waitingTime += (time - cust[0] - cust[1]);`. Subtracting the service time `cust[1]` from the wait time calculation gives the correct waiting time for each customer.

Bug Type:
Logical Error

Fix and Updated Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.98%) | Memory: 55.7 MB (Top 34.92%)
class Solution {
    public double averageWaitingTime(int[][] customers) {
        double time = 0;
        double waitingTime = 0;

        for (int[] cust : customers) {
            time = Math.max(cust[0], time);
            time = time + cust[1];
            waitingTime += (time - cust[0] - cust[1]);
        }

        return waitingTime / customers.length;
    }
}
