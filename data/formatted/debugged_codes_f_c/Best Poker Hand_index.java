The bug in the provided code is in the `for` loop condition and indexing. 

In the `for` loop, the condition `i < 5` should be changed to `i < ranks.length` to ensure that the loop iterates over all the elements in the `ranks` array. 

In the loop, the statement `arr[ranks[i - 1]]++;` causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because it uses `i - 1` as the index. The fix is to use `arr[ranks[i]]++;` to access the correct index.

Additionally, the variable `card` is not correctly incremented. Instead of `card++`, it should be `card = card + 1;` or `card += 1;` to increment it by one.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 41.6 MB (Top 33.75%)
class Solution {
    public String bestHand(int[] ranks, char[] suits) {
        int max = 0;
        int card = 0;
        char ch = suits[0];
        int[] arr = new int[14];
        for (int i = 0; i < ranks.length; i++) {
            arr[ranks[i]]++;
            max = Math.max(max, arr[ranks[i]]);
            if (suits[i] == ch) card = card + 1;
        }
        if (card == 5) return "Flush";
        return max >= 3 ? "Three of a Kind" : (max == 2 ? "Pair" : "High Card");
    }
}
```
