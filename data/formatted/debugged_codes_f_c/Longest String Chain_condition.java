Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues:

1. The method `compareForIncreaseByOne` is missing the closing bracket `}`.
2. The `compareForIncreaseByOne` method has a logical error. It checks if `str1` is one character longer than `str2` and then compares the characters in both strings. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility of characters being skipped or inserted in `str1`. The fix is to modify the method to check if `str1` can be formed by removing one character from `str2`.
3. The line `Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> a.length() - b.length());` is sorting the array of words in ascending order of length, which is not necessary for the solution. The fix is to remove this line.
4. The `longestStrChain` method uses an uninitialized variable `maxi` in the loop. It should be initialized with `dp[0]`.
5. The line `maxi = Math.max(maxi, dp[i]);` should be moved outside the inner loop to correctly update the maximum chain length.

Bug Fixes and Updated Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {

    boolean compareForIncreaseByOne(String str1, String str2) {
        if (str1.length() != str2.length() - 1) {
            return false;
        }
        int first = 0;
        int second = 0;
        while (first < str1.length() && second < str2.length()) {
            if (str1.charAt(first) == str2.charAt(second)) {
                first++;
                second++;
            } else {
                first++;
            }
        }
        if (first == str1.length() && second == str2.length()) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public int longestStrChain(String[] words) {
        int N = words.length;
        int[] dp = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        int maxi = dp[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (compareForIncreaseByOne(words[j], words[i]) && dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]) {
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
                }
            }
            maxi = Math.max(maxi
