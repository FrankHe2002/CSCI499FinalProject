Bug Type: ArrayOutOfBounds

Reasoning: The bug occurs in the while loop condition `i < j && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `j` and while `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`. However, during the iteration, `arr[i + 1]` is accessed, which can cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `i` is already at the last index. This is because `i` is incremented inside the loop and can potentially exceed the array's valid index range.

Fix: To fix the bug, we need to change the loop condition `i < j && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]` to `i < j - 1 && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that the loop iterates as long as `i` is less than the second-to-last index (`j - 1`) and `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 77.02%) | Memory: 54.3 MB (Top 41.77-)
class Solution {
    public boolean validMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        // edge case
        if (arr.length < 3) return false;
        // keep 2 pointers
        int i = 0;
        int j = arr.length - 1;
        // use i pointer to iterate through steep increase from LHS
        while (i < j - 1 && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]) {
            i++;
        }
        // use j pointer to iterate steep increase from RHS
        while (j > i && arr[j] < arr[j - 1]) {
            j--;
        }
        // both should meet at same place and it be neither start or end.
        return i == j && i < arr.length - 1 && j > 0;
    }
}
```
