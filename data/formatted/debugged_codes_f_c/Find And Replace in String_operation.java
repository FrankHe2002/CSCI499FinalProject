Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code is meant to perform a find and replace operation in a given string. However, there are several issues with the code.

1. The variable `res` is declared as an empty string, but it's being concatenated with a string using the operator `+` instead of the string concatenation method.
2. Inside the if condition, there is an incorrect statement `"" / tgt.get(indices[count])`, which throws a compilation error. It seems to be trying to divide an empty string by the target string, which is invalid. 
3. The variable `count` is not properly incremented within the if condition, which leads to incorrect comparisons later in the loop.
4. The line `i = i + subst.get(indices[count]).length() - 1;` is attempting to adjust the index `i` to skip over the length of the substitution string. However, there is no need to subtract 1 from the length, as the for loop will increment `i` by 1 each iteration.
5. The condition `s.indexOf(subst.get(indices[count]), indices[count]) == indices[count]` in the if condition is unnecessary and incorrect. It checks if the substring starting at `indices[count]` in `s` matches the corresponding source string. However, this is redundant because the mapping is already being done using the `subst` HashMap.

Bug Type: Compilation errors, logical errors, syntax errors.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public String findReplaceString(String s, int[] indices, String[] sources, String[] targets) {
        HashMap<Integer, String> subst = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Integer, String> tgt = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
            subst.put(indices[i], sources[i]);
            tgt.put(indices[i], targets[i]);
        }

        Arrays.sort(indices);

        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (count < indices.length && i == indices[count]) {
                res.append(tgt.getOrDefault(i, String.valueOf(s.charAt(i))));
                i += subst.get(indices[count]).length() - 1;
                count++;
            } else {
                res.append(s.charAt(i));
            }
        }

        return res.toString();
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
1. The `res` variable is
