Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
The bug is a logical error in the code. The condition `root.left != null && root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null` is used to check if the current node is a left leaf node (i.e., if it has a left child and that left child has no children). However, this condition does not account for the case where the current node itself is a left leaf node and does not have any children. As a result, the code skips the case where the current node is a left leaf node with no children.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add an additional condition to check if the current node itself is a left leaf node with no children. We can modify the code as follows:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;

        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return root.val;
        }

        int sum = 0;

        if (root.left != null && root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null) {
            sum += root.left.val;
        }

        sum += sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left) + sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right);

        return sum;
    }
}
```
