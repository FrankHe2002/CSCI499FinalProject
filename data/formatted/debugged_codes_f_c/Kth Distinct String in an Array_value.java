The bug in the provided code is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the desired kth distinct element is not found. The code currently returns an empty string in this case, which doesn't match the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the code to handle the case when the kth distinct element is not found. One way to do this is to introduce a variable `count` to keep track of the number of distinct elements found so far. Then we can add a check after the second loop to compare `count` with `k` and return an empty string if `count` is less than `k`.

Additionally, the code doesn't import the `HashMap` class and the `Map` interface. To fix this, we need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
```

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public String kthDistinct(String[] arr, int k) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String s : arr) {
            if (map.containsKey(s))
                map.put(s, map.get(s) + 1);
            else
                map.put(s, 1);
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (String s : arr) {
            if (map.get(s) == 1 && ++count == k) {
                return s;
            }
        }

        if (count < k) {
            return "";
        }

        return "";
    }
}
```
