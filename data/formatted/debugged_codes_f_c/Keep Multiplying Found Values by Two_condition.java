Bug type: Semantic/Logical Error

Reasoning: 

The provided code aims to find a final value by doubling the original value until it is not present in a given array. However, the logic is incorrect. The code incorrectly checks if the 'original' value exists in the set 'set' and doubles it. Instead, it should double the 'original' value until it does exist in the set. 

Additionally, there are missing semicolons at the end of the statements inside both the for loop and while loop, causing syntax errors.

Fix:
1. Invert the condition `if (set.contains(original))` to `if (!set.contains(original))` inside the while loop.
2. Add semicolons at the end of the statements inside the for loop and while loop.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public int findFinalValue(int[] nums, int original) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : nums){
            if (i < original){
                set.add(i);
            }
        }
        while (true){
            if (!set.contains(original)){
                original *= 2;
            }
            else{
                break;
            }
        }
        return original;
    }
}
```
