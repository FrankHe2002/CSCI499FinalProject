Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code aims to determine if there exist two non-negative numbers, `a` and `b`, such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.
2. The `while` loop continues until `a` and `b` cross each other, i.e., until `a > b`.
3. In each iteration of the loop, the code checks if `(a^2 + b^2)` is equal to `c`.
4. If the sum is less than `c`, `a` is incremented by 1 to increase the sum.
5. If the sum is greater than `c`, `b` is decremented by 1 to decrease the sum.
6. If the sum is equal to `c`, the code returns `true` as the condition is satisfied.
7. If the loop completes without finding a valid sum, the code returns `false`.

The bug in the code is a logical error. 

In the `else if` condition, the code checks the sum of `a^2` and `b^2` against `c` to determine whether to increment `a` or decrement `b`. However, `((a * a) + (b * b))` is recalculated at each conditional check. Since the sum is recalculated during each comparison, the control flow may increment `a` when it should have decremented `b`, leading to incorrect logic.

Fix:

To fix this bug, we will store the value of `((a * a) + (b * b))` in a separate variable before the conditional check. This way, the sum will be calculated only once per iteration, allowing the correct logic to be applied.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        long a = 0;
        long b = (long) Math.sqrt(c);

        while (a <= b) {
            long sum = (a * a) + (b * b);
            if (sum == c) {
                return true;
            } else if (sum < c) {
                a++;
            } else {
                b--;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
