Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the logic for dividing the numbers into groups and calculating the minimum operations is incorrect. The nested loop is iterating over `one` from -1 to `n` and over `three` from `one + 1` to `n`, where `n` is the size of the `nums` list. However, the correct range for `one` should be from 0 to `n-2`. Additionally, the correct range for `three` should be from `one + 2` to `n`. This will ensure that all three groups have at least one number in them. 

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(List<Integer> nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        int n = nums.size();
        for (int one = 0; one < n - 1; one++) {
            for (int three = one + 2; three <= n; three++) {
                min = Math.min(min, computeOperations(one, three, nums));
            }
        }
        return min;
    }

    int computeOperations(int one, int three, List<Integer> nums) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            Integer pos = nums.get(i);
            if (i <= one) {
                if (pos != 2) count++;
            } else if (i < three) {
                if (pos != 2) count++;
            } else {
                if (pos != 3) count++;
            }

        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
