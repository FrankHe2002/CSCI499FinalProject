Bug Type: Compilation Errors, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. Compilation Errors:
   - Missing semicolon at the end of statement: `result += c`.
   - Typo in variable name: `city4`, should be `city2`.
2. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
   - The array size of `numRoadsConnectedCity` is `100 + 1`, but it should be `n + 1` to accommodate `n` cities.
   - The array size of `raadExist` is `n x n`, but it should be `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` to accommodate `n` cities.
3. Logical Error:
   - The variable `rank` is calculated by adding the number of roads connected to `city1` and `city4` (should be `city2`).
   - The condition `if (raadExist[city1][city2])` should check `raadExist[city1][city2]` or `raadExist[city2][city1]` to correctly account for the existence of a road.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximalNetworkRank(int n, int[][] roads) {

        // number of road connected to city
        int[] numRoadsConnectedCity = new int[n + 1];

        // road exist between two cities
        boolean[][] roadExist = new boolean[n + 1][n + 1];

        for (int[] cities : roads) {

            // increment the count of numbers of connected city
            numRoadsConnectedCity[cities[0]]++;
            numRoadsConnectedCity[cities[1]]++;

            // mark road exist, between two cities
            roadExist[cities[0]][cities[1]] = true;
            roadExist[cities[1]][cities[0]] = true;
        }

        int maxRank = 0;
        for (int city1 = 0; city1 < n - 1; city1++) {
            for (int city2 = city1 + 1; city2 < n; city2++) {

                // count total number of road connected to both city
                int rank = numRoadsConnectedCity[city1] + numRoadsConnectedCity[city2];

                // just decrement the rank, if both city connected
                if (roadExist[city1][city2] || roadExist[city2][
