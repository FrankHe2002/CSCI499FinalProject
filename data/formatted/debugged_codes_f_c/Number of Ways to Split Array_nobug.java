Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: From the provided code, it seems like the intention is to count the number of ways to split the array `nums` such that the sum of the left subarray is greater than or equal to the sum of the right subarray.

However, the current implementation is incorrect. The code only checks if the sum of the left subarray `localSum` becomes greater than or equal to `sum - localSum`. This condition does not guarantee that the split is valid in terms of the sums of the left and right subarrays.

To fix this, we need to iterate over the array `nums` and calculate the prefix sums. Then, for each possible split point, we need to check if the sum of the left subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the right subarray. If it is, we increment the counter `sol`.

Additionally, `sol` should be initialized as `-1` instead of `0` because we need to exclude the last element of the array from the possible splits.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int waysToSplitArray(int[] nums) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            sum += i;
        }
        int sol = -1;
        long localSum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            localSum += nums[i];
            if (localSum * 3 <= sum) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                    if (localSum * 2 <= sum - nums[j]) {
                        count++;
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
