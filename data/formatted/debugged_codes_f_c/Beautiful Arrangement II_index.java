Bug type in the provided code:
The bug in the provided code is a syntax error and a logical error.

Reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. Syntax error: The code has a syntax error in the line `int[] result = new int[Solution];` because `Solution` should be replaced with the variable `n` to determine the size of the array.
2. Logical error: The code has a logical error in the line `result[i] = result[i - 1] + k * sign;`. The logic is incorrect and does not match the intended functionality. The code should construct an array such that the absolute difference between adjacent elements is unique and ranges from 1 to k. This requires a different approach than the current implementation.

Fix for the bug:
To fix the code, we need to correct the syntax by replacing `Solution` with `n` in the line `int[] result = new int[Solution];`. Then, we need to update the logic to construct the array correctly.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] constructArray(int n, int k) {
        int[] result = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result[i] = i + 1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            reverse(result, i, n - 1);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public void reverse(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation for the fix:
1. Syntax error: The line `int[] result = new int[Solution];` is corrected to `int[] result = new int[n];` so that the size of the array matches the provided input `n`.
2. Logical error: The logic for constructing the array is updated to a two-step process. First, we initialize the array with consecutive numbers from 1 to n. Then, we reverse a subarray of length (k - 1) to create the unique absolute difference. The `reverse` method is called to reverse the subarray efficiently.
   - The first loop initializes the array with consecutive numbers from 1 to n.
   - The second loop reverses the subarray starting from index 1
