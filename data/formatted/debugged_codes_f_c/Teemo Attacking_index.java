Bug Type: Array Indexing Error

Reasoning: 
1. The code tries to calculate the total poisoned duration by iterating over `timeSeries`.
2. In the else block of the loop, the code attempts to calculate the poisoned duration between the current and previous time points.
3. However, there is a typo in the indexing expression `timeSeries[1] - timeSeries[i - 1]`. It should be `timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i - 1]` to access the correct time points.
4. The current expression `timeSeries[1] - timeSeries[i - 1]` always uses the second element of `timeSeries` instead of the current element.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < timeSeries.length; i++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                sum += duration;
            } else {
                sum += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i - 1]);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
