Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: 

In the buggy code, the condition `cur[1] < n - 1` is being checked before modifying the value of `cur[1]`. This results in an incorrect comparison because the value of `cur[1]` is not updated yet. As a result, the code tries to access `cur[2]`, which leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` since `cur` is an array of size 2.

Fix:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to update the value of `cur[1]` before the comparison in the `if` statement. We should change `cur[2]++` to `cur[1]++` to correctly update the value of `cur[1]`.

Fixed code:

```java
/**
 * Using PriorityQueue
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity:
 * O(min(N,K)*log(min(N,K))) -> To add initial min(N,K) elements, as we are adding the elements individually.
 * If we were adding all elements in one go, then the complexity would be O(min(N,K))
 * Refer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/34697891
 * O(2*(K-1)*log(min(N,K)) -> To poll K-1 elements and add next K-1 elements.
 * Total Time Complexity: O((min(N,K) + 2*(K-1)) * log(min(N,K)) = O(K * log(min(N,K))
 * <p>
 * Space Complexity: O(min(N, K))
 * <p>
 * N = Length of one side of the matrix. K = input value k.

    public int kthSmallest(int[][] matrix, int k) {
        if (matrix == null || k <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input is invalid");
        }

        int n = matrix.length;
        if (k > n * n) {
            throw new NoSuchElementException("k is greater than number of elements in matrix");
        }
        if (k == 1) {
            return matrix[0][0];
        }
        if (k == n * n) {
            return matrix[n - 1][n - 1];
        }

        PriorityQueue<int[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (matrix[a[0]][a[1]] - matrix[b[0]][b[1]]));
