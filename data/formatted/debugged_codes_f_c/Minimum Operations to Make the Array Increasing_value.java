Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The variable `count` is initialized to -1, which is incorrect because the minimum number of operations needed to satisfy the conditions of the code is 0.
2. In the first `if` condition, if the length of the `nums` array is less than or equal to 1, the code returns 0. However, this condition should be modified to `nums.length == 1` because only when there is exactly one element in the array, no operations are needed.
3. The loop logic contains incorrect calculations for the `count` variable.
   - When the current element (`num`) is equal to the next element (`nums[i]`), the `count` variable should be incremented by 1. However, the code is incorrectly incrementing both `count` and `num`.
   - When the current element (`num`) is greater than the next element (`nums[i]`), the `num` variable should be incremented by 1 and the difference between `num` and `nums[i]` should be added to `count`. However, the code is incorrectly incrementing `num` twice and adding the wrong value to `count`.
   - When the current element (`num`) is less than the next element (`nums[i]`), the `num` variable should be updated to the value of `nums[i]`. However, the code is incorrectly updating `num` to `nums[i]` without considering the condition when `num` is greater than `nums[i]`.
   
Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        int num = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (num >= nums[i]) {
                count += num - nums[i] + 1;
                num++;
            } else {
                num = nums[i];
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
