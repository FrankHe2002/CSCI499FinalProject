Bug Type: Logical Error / Infinite Loop

Reasoning: 
1. The code attempts to insert a dot separator every three characters from the right in the string representation of the input integer.
2. The loop condition `index < 1` is supposed to terminate the loop when `index` becomes less than 1 (indicating no more characters to insert separators), but it's incorrect.
3. The correct loop condition should be `index > 0` to ensure the loop continues until all the necessary separators are inserted.
4. Additionally, for the loop to work correctly, the initial value of `index` should be `str.length() - 3` (instead of `str.length() - 3`) to start from the correct position.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String thousandSeparator(int n) {
        StringBuffer str = new StringBuffer(Integer.toString(n));
        int index = str.length() - 3;

        while (index > 0) {
            str.insert(index, '.');
            index -= 3;
        }

        return str.toString();
    }
}
```
