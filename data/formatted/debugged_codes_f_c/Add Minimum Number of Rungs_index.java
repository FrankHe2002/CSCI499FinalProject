Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: The bug is caused by the expression `rungs[i + 2]` when `i` is equal to `rungs.length - 1`. This causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because it attempts to access an index that is out of the array's bounds. 

Fix: Modify the condition in the ternary operator to `(i == rungs.length - 1)` instead of `(i == 0)`. This ensures that the correct index is accessed when `i` is equal to `rungs.length - 1`. 

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 46.95%) | Memory: 72.5 MB (Top 49.39%)
class Solution {
    public int addRungs(int[] rungs, int dist) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rungs.length; i++) {
            int d = (i == rungs.length - 1) ? rungs[i] - rungs[i - 1] : rungs[i + 2] - rungs[i];
            if (d > dist) {
                ans += d / dist;
                ans += (d % dist == 0) ? - 1 : 0;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
