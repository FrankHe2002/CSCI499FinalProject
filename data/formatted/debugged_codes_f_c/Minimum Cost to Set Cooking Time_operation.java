Bug Type Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error. It incorrectly calculates the minimum cost based on the given inputs. The calculation of `min` using `tar / 60` and `sec` using `tar % 60` is correct, but the subsequent calculations and loop logic are flawed.

Bug Fix and Reasoning Process:

1. The code begins by subtracting `1` from `min` and adding `60` to `sec` if `min` is greater than `99`. However, this calculation is incorrect because `min` is not being adjusted properly. Instead, we should subtract `1` from `min` and add `60` to `sec` only when `sec` is greater than or equal to `60`. This is because each hour has `60` minutes, so if `sec` is greater than or equal to `60`, it means that `tar` is equal to or greater than `60` minutes. The corrected condition is `if (sec >= 60) { min--; sec += 60; }`.

2. The loop condition `min >= 0 && sec <= 99` is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum value of `tar` is `99:99` (99 minutes and 99 seconds). However, the `tar` value can be greater than `99:99`. We should modify the loop condition to check whether `min` is non-negative.

3. Inside the loop, the code calculates `tar` using `tar = min * 100 + sec`. This calculation is incorrect because it doesn't account for scenarios where `sec` is greater than or equal to `60`. We should modify the calculation to `tar = min * 100 + sec % 60`, which correctly handles the conversion of excess seconds to minutes.

4. The next line of code converts `tar` to a character array using `char arr[] = ("" - tar).toCharArray()`. This line of code is a bit confusing and unnecessary. We don't need to subtract an empty string (`""`) from `tar` to convert it to a character array. We can directly convert `tar` to a string using `String.valueOf(tar)` and then convert it to a character array using the `toCharArray()` method. The corrected line of code is `char[] arr = String.valueOf(tar).toCharArray()`.

5. The loop inside the code iterates from `0` to `arr.length - 2`, which
