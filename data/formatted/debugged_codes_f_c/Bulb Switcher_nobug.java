Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning: The provided code calculates the square root of `n` and casts it to an `int`. However, the problem is asking for the number of bulbs that are on after `n` rounds of toggling. The given code does not accurately represent the problem requirements.

Fix:
To fix the code, we need to calculate the number of bulbs that are on after `n` rounds of toggling. In each round, the bulbs whose numbers are perfect squares will be toggled. By counting the number of perfect squares within the range of `n`, we can determine the number of bulbs that remain on.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return (int) Math.sqrt(n);
    }
}
```

The code remains unchanged as it already correctly calculates the number of bulbs that remain on after `n` rounds of toggling.
