Bug Type: Syntax error, logical error.

Reasoning: The code has a syntax error in the line `grid[i][j] = Math.min(grid[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, (cnt + 1) >> 1);` where the shift operator `>>` is missing its right operand. Additionally, there is a logical error in the statement `if (0 != cnt || 0 == j) continue;`, which causes the inner loop to continue even when `cnt` is not 0 and `j` is 0. 

Fix:
1. Add the right operand to the shift operator `>>`, which in this case is `1`. 
2. Modify the logical condition to `if (cnt != 0 && j != 0) continue;`, so that the loop only continues when `cnt` is 0 and `j` is not 0.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 17 ms (Top 60.00%) | Memory: 67.7 MB (Top 80.00%)
class Solution {
    public int countPyramids(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] rev = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++ i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++ j) rev[m - i - 1][j] = grid[i][j];
        }
        return cal(grid) + cal(rev);
    }

    private int cal(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length, res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++ i) {
            for (int j = 0, cnt = 0; j < n; ++ j) {
                if (0 != grid[i][j]) cnt++;
                else cnt = 0;
                if (cnt != 0 && j != 0) continue;
                grid[i][j] = Math.min(grid[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, (cnt + 1) >> 1);
                res += grid[i][j] - 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
