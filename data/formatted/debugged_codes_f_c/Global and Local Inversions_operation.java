Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

The provided Java code is checking if the absolute difference between each element `nums[i]` and its index `i` is greater than 1. If any element violates this condition, the method returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.

However, the bug in this code is that it incorrectly assumes that all local inversions are ideal inversions. An ideal inversion occurs when `nums[i]` is equal to `i` or `i+1`. However, the provided code only checks for the difference between `nums[i]` and `i`, ignoring the possibility of the element being `i+1`.

Fix: 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the absolute difference is greater than 1 or not. Therefore, we should change the condition from `Math.abs(nums[i] - i) > 1` to `Math.abs(nums[i] - i) > 1 || Math.abs(nums[i] - (i+1)) > 1`.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isIdealPermutation(int[] nums) {

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (Math.abs(nums[i] - i) > 1 || Math.abs(nums[i] - (i+1)) > 1) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
