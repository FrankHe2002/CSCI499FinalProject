Bug Type: Syntax Error and Logic Error.

Reasoning:

1. Syntax Error: The line `long anstillnow = % 1;` contains a syntax error. The `%` symbol is not being used correctly and lacks an operand. It appears to be an erroneous leftover from a previous operation.

2. Logic Error: The variable `anstillnow` is initialized to an arbitrary value (`% 1;`). It should be initialized to a valid value, which depends on the intended functionality of the code.

Fix:

1. Syntax Error: Remove the `%` symbol and set `anstillnow` to a valid initial value, such as `long anstillnow = 0;`.

2. Logic Error: If the intended function is to find the minimum time, the initial value of `anstillnow` should be set to a very high value to ensure that it is updated during the loop. Assuming that the maximum trip duration is within the range of `long` type, `long anstillnow = Long.MAX_VALUE;` can be used as a valid initial value.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumTime(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        long anstillnow = Long.MAX_VALUE;

        long left = 1, right = 100000000000001L;

        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  //find mid point like this to avoid overflow
            long curr_trips = 0;
            for (int t : time) {
                curr_trips += mid / t;
            }

            if (curr_trips >= totalTrips) {
                anstillnow = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return anstillnow;
    }
}
```
