Bug Type: Infinite Loop

Reasoning: 
1. The provided code is supposed to find the length of the smallest repunit divisible by K.
2. The code uses a while loop with conditions to check if the repunit is divisible by K.
3. However, there is no condition to break out of the while loop, resulting in an infinite loop if the repunit is not divisible by K.

Fix: 
1. To fix the bug and prevent an infinite loop, we need to add a condition to break out of the while loop when the value of n becomes 0 (which means the repunit is divisible by K).
2. To add the condition, we can modify the while loop condition to `while (n != 0)`.
3. This condition ensures that the loop continues until n becomes 0 (indicating divisibility) and stops the loop when the condition is met.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int k) {
        // if (k % 2 == 0 || k % 5 != 0) return -1;  // this trick may save a little time
        boolean[] hit = new boolean[k];
        int n = 0, ans = 0;
        while (n != 0) { // added condition to break out of the loop
            ++ ans;
            n = (n * 10 + 1) % k; // we only focus on whether to divide, so we only need to keep the remainder.
            if (n == 0) return ans; // can be divisible
            if (hit[n])
                return - 1; // the remainder of the division repeats, so it starts to loop that means it cannot be divisible.
            hit[n] = true;
        }
        return -1; // added return statement to handle the case when the repunit is not divisible by K
    }
}
```
