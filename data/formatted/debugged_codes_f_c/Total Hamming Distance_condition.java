Bug type: Logic error and Syntax error.

Reasoning process:
1. Syntax error: The syntax error in this code is in the inner for loop condition. The condition `j >= 32` is incorrect because it will never execute the loop since it starts at 0 and `j` is never incremented. The correct condition should be `j < 32`, which ensures that the loop iterates from 0 to 31.
2. Logic error: The logic error in this code is in the calculation of the `idx` variable. Bitwise shifting and masking are used to extract the individual bits of `nums[i]`, but the `(nums[i] >> j) & 1` expression is reversed. The correct expression should be `(nums[i] >> (31 - j)) & 1`, which properly extracts the bits starting from the most significant bit.

Fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 10 ms (Top 38.60%) | Memory: 40 MB (Top 98.14%)
class Solution {
    public int totalHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        int[][] cnt = new int[2][32];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
                int idx = (nums[i] >> (31 - j)) & 1;
                total += cnt[idx ^ 1][j];
                cnt[idx][j]++;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```
