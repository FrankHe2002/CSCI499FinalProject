Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code is a solution to the "Car Pooling" problem. The code uses a map called `destinationToPassengers` to track the number of passengers at each destination. The code iterates through the `trips` array, updates the number of passengers at each destination, and then checks if the total number of passengers exceeds the given capacity.

There are two bugs in the code:
1. Syntax error: The loop in the second `for` statement is missing the closing parenthesis.
2. Logical error: The code incorrectly updates the number of passengers at drop destinations. Instead of subtracting the number of passengers from the current count, it adds them.

To fix the first bug, we add a closing parenthesis at the end of the `for` statement.

To fix the second bug, we change the line `destinationToPassengers.put(trip[2], currPassengersAtDrop - trip[0]);` to `destinationToPassengers.put(trip[2], currPassengersAtDrop + trip[0]);`, aligning the operation with the intended purpose (adding the number of passengers at drop destinations).

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> destinationToPassengers = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int[] trip : trips) {
            int currPassengersAtPickup = destinationToPassengers.getOrDefault(trip[1], 0);
            int currPassengersAtDrop = destinationToPassengers.getOrDefault(trip[2], 0);
            destinationToPassengers.put(trip[1], currPassengersAtPickup + trip[0]);
            destinationToPassengers.put(trip[2], currPassengersAtDrop + trip[0]);
        }

        int currPassengers = 0;
        for (int passengers : destinationToPassengers.values()) {
            currPassengers += passengers;

            if (currPassengers > capacity) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
