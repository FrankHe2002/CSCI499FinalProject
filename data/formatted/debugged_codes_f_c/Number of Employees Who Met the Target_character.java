The bug in the provided code is a syntax error caused by an extra closing brace (`}`) after the `if` statement. This extra closing brace ends the `for` loop prematurely, causing a compilation error.

To fix this, we need to remove the extra closing brace and format the code properly.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 42.5%) | Memory: 41.26 MB (Top 39.0%)

class Solution {
    public int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(int[] hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i : hours) {
            if (i >= target) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
