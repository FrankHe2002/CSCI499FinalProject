Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 
The buggy code calculates the minimum number of letters that need to be changed between two strings `s` and `t`. However, it incorrectly initializes the `diff` variable to `1`, which leads to incorrect calculations. Instead, the `diff` variable should be initialized to `0` since there are no differences initially.

Fix:
Initialize the `diff` variable to `0` in order to accurately calculate the minimum number of letter changes.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 16 ms (Top 64.38%) | Memory: 54.3 MB (Top 67.83%)
//find the frequency of every letter and check difference between the frequency of each letter then divide it by 2 to calculate the minimum number of letter to be changed.
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        int sf[] = new int[26];
        int tf[] = new int[26];
        int diff = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            sf[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            tf[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            diff += (int) Math.abs(sf[i] - tf[i]);
        }
        return diff / 2;
    }
}
