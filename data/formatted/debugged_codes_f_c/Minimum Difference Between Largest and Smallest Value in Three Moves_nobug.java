The bug in the provided code is that the loop condition in line 25 is incorrect. The loop should continue while `left <= 3`, but it currently only checks if `left` is less than or equal to 3. As a result, the loop only runs once instead of four times as intended.

To fix the bug, the loop condition should be changed to `left < 4` to ensure that the loop runs four times.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length <= 4) {
            return 0;
        }

        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int left = 0, right = 3;

        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (left < 4) {
            int mini = nums[left];
            int max = nums[nums.length - right - 1];
            res = Math.min(res, max - mini);

            left++;
            right--;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
