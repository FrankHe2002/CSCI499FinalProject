Bug Type: `NullPointerException`

Reasoning: The provided code throws a `NullPointerException` on the line `long totalView = popularity.getOrDefault(name, (long) 0) + (long) view;`. This is because the `popularity` map is empty when attempting to retrieve the value associated with `name`. Since the value is not present, `popularity.getOrDefault(name, (long) 0)` returns `null`, and trying to add `view` to `null` results in a `NullPointerException`.

Fix: To fix this issue, we need to initialize the `popularity` map with default values before using it. We can modify the line `Map<String, Long> popularity = new HashMap<>();` to `Map<String, Long> popularity = new HashMap<String, Long>(){{put("", (long) 0);}};`. This initializes the `popularity` map with an empty string key and a value of `(long) 0`. Now, if the value for a specific key is not present in the map, it will default to `(long) 0` instead of `null`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 96 ms (Top 26.5%) | Memory: 129.57 MB (Top 6.0%)

class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> mostPopularCreator(String[] creators, String[] ids, int[] views) {
        Map<String, Long> popularity = new HashMap<String, Long>(){{put("", (long) 0);}};
        Map<String, Map<String, Long>> info = new HashMap<>();
        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int len = creators.length;
        long maxPop = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            String name = creators[i];
            String id = ids[i];
            int view = views[i];
            long totalView = popularity.getOrDefault(name, (long) 0) + (long) view;
            popularity.put(name, totalView);
            Map<String, Long> nameInfo = info.getOrDefault(name, new HashMap<>());

            // Uncomment next line and remove the line after will get the last one correct. The correct times of view is the maximum value instead of the accumulation of them.
            // long idView = Math.max(nameInfo.getOrDefault(id, (long)0), (long)view);

            long idView = nameInfo.getOrDefault(id, (long) 0) + (long
