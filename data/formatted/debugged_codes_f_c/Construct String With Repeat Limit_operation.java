Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
After reviewing the code, it appears that the logic for finding the next maximum character is incorrect. The `findNextMax` method is supposed to find the next non-zero value in the `counter` array starting from index `from`. However, the current implementation is incorrect and does not correctly identify the next maximum value.

Fix:
To fix the logical error, the `findNextMax` method needs to be modified. Instead of decrementing `curr` and returning it when `counter[curr] > 0`, the method should increment `curr` and check if it reaches the end of the array before finding a non-zero value. If it reaches the end of the array, the method should return -1 to indicate no more non-zero values are found.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatLimitedString(String s, int repeatLimit) {
        int[] counter = new int[26];
        int max = 0;
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            int curr = ch - 'a';
            max = Math.max(max, curr);
            counter[curr]++;
        }

        int repeated = 0;
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        while (max >= 0) {
            builder.append((char) ('a' + max));
            counter[max]--;
            repeated++;

            if (counter[max] == 0) {
                max = findNextMax(counter, max - 1);
                repeated = 0;
                continue;
            }

            if (repeated == repeatLimit) {
                int lower = findNextMax(counter, max + 1);
                if (lower < 0) {
                    return builder.toString();
                }
                builder.append((char) ('a' + lower));
                counter[lower]--;
                repeated = 0;
            }
        }

        return builder.toString();
    }

    private int findNextMax(int[] counter, int from) {
        int curr = from;
        while (curr < counter.length) {
            if (counter[curr] > 0) {
                return curr;
            }
            curr++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

The logical error in the `findNextMax` method is fixed by incrementing `curr` and returning -1 if no more non-zero values are found. Additionally, in the `repeatLimitedString` method, the parameter `repeatLimit` is used to determine
