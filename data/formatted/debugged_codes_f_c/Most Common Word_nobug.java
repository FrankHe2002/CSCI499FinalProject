Bug Type: Syntax Error and Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. Syntax Error: The code is missing semicolons at the end of the statements inside the for loops. The missing semicolons cause a syntax error.
2. Logical Error: The logic of removing banned words from the hashmap is incorrect. The code removes banned words regardless of their count, leading to an incorrect result.

Fix:
1. Add semicolons at the end of the statements inside the for loops.
2. Adjust the logic of removing banned words to consider their count. Instead of unconditionally removing, decrement the count of banned words in the hashmap.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 23 ms (Top 55.73%) | Memory: 44.3 MB (Top 45.07%)

class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {

        HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        String[] words = paragraph.replaceAll("[!?',;.]", " ").toLowerCase().split("\\s+");
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (hm.containsKey(words[i]))
                hm.replace(words[i], hm.get(words[i]), hm.get(words[i]) + 1);
            else
                hm.put(words[i], 1);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < banned.length; i++) {
            if (hm.containsKey(banned[i])) {
                hm.put(banned[i], hm.get(banned[i]) - 1);
            }
        }

        return Collections.max(hm.entrySet(), Map.Entry.comparingByValue()).getKey();
    }
}
```
