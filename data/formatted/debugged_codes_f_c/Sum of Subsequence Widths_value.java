Bug Type: Arithmetic Overflow

Reasoning:
The code performs arithmetic operations on `ans` and `p` variables. These variables are of type `long` to handle larger values. However, the result of the expression `(ans + p * nums[i] - p * nums[nums.length - 1 - i])` is assigned to `ans`, which is of type `int`. If the value of `ans` exceeds the range of `int` (2^31 - 1), an arithmetic overflow can occur.

Fix:
Change the type of `ans` variable from `int` to `long` to ensure it can hold the computed value without causing an overflow.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 49 ms (Top 70.11%) | Memory: 74.1 MB (Top 69.83%)
class Solution {
    public int sumSubseqWidths(int[] nums) {
        int MOD = (int) 2e9 + 7;
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        long ans = 0;
        long p = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            ans = (ans + p * nums[i] - p * nums[nums.length - 1 - i]) % MOD;
            p = (p * 2) % MOD;
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```
