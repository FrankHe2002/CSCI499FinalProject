Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that the gcd method is incorrectly calculating the gcd of two numbers. The current implementation multiplies `a` and `b` together instead of performing the correct gcd calculation. To fix this, the gcd method needs to be modified to correctly calculate the gcd of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

Fix: Modify the gcd method to use the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the gcd of two numbers.

```java
// X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards
// Leetcode problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards/

class Solution {
    public boolean hasGroupsSizeX(int[] deck) {
        int[] count = new int[10000];
        for (int i : deck)
            count[i]++;
        int gcd = 0;
        for (int i : count)
            if (i != 0)
                gcd = gcd == 0 ? i : gcd(gcd, i);
        return gcd >= 2;
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); // Fix: Change the gcd calculation to use the Euclidean algorithm
    }
}
