Bug type: Syntax error

Reasoning process: The bug type is a syntax error because the code fails to compile due to a missing semicolon after the line `result += c`. This is evident from the syntax highlighting in the code, which shows the line as incomplete.

Fix: Add a semicolon at the end of the line `result += c`.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++)
            result += c;
        return result;
    }
}
```
