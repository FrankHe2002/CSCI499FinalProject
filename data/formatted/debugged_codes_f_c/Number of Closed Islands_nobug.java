The bug in the provided code is that the `isClosed` variable is not being reset to `true` for each island. Since the `isClosed` variable is declared as an instance variable, it retains its value across multiple invocations of the `dfs` method. This causes the `isClosed` flag to retain the value from a previous island and incorrectly apply it to the current island.

To fix this bug, the `isClosed` variable should be declared as a local variable within the `dfs` method. This ensures that it is reset to `true` for each island traversal.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 4 ms (Top 35.60%) | Memory: 47.1 MB (Top 38.97%)
class Solution {
    public int closedIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < m - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {

                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    boolean isClosed = true; // Declare isClosed as a local variable

                    dfs(grid, i, j, isClosed);

                    if (isClosed) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public void dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j, boolean isClosed) { // Update method signature
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i > grid.length - 1 || j > grid[0].length - 1 || grid[i][j] != 0) return;

        grid[i][j] = 1; // to mark as visited

        if (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == grid.length - 1 || j == grid[0].length - 1) isClosed = false;

        dfs(grid, i, j + 1, isClosed);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1, isClosed);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j, isClosed);
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j, isClosed);
    }
}
