Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: In the provided code, the logic for finding the longest well performing interval is incorrect. The code attempts to find the longest length of a continuous positive sequence, which is not the correct approach for this problem. For a well-performing interval, the difference between the number of tiring days and non-tiring days should be greater than 0, not just positive. Additionally, the code uses a nested loop to check all possible sliding windows, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).

Fix:
1. Change the approach to a stack-based approach for finding the longest well-performing interval.
2. Initialize the result and a variable `score` as 0.
3. Create a stack to store the indices of the prefixSum array where the score is strictly positive. Initialize the stack as empty.
4. Iterate over the prefixSum array and calculate the score as the difference between tiring days and non-tiring days. If the score is greater than 0, update the result to the current index + 1 (as the index starts from 0).
5. If the stack is empty or the score at the current index is less than or equal to the score at the index stored in the top of the stack, push the current index to the stack.
6. Iterate over the prefixSum array in reverse order. If the score at the current index is greater than the score at the index stored in the top of the stack, pop elements from the stack until the stack is empty or the score at the index stored at the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current score.
7. While popping elements from the stack, calculate the length of the well-performing interval as the difference between the current index and the index stored in the top of the stack. Update the result if the length is greater than the current result.
8. Return the result as the length of the longest well-performing interval.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int longestWPI(int[] hours) {
        int n = hours.length;

        int[] prefixSum = new int[n + 1];
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += (hours[i] > 8) ? 1 : -1;
            prefixSum[i + 1] = sum;
        }

        int result = 0;
        Deque<Integer> stack = new Array
