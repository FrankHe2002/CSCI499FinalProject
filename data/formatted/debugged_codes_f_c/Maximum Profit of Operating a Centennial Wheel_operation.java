The bug in the provided code is in the while loop where `cSit` is being incremented instead of decremented in the else condition. This is causing an incorrect calculation of the seating numbers and resulting in incorrect profit calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to decrement `cSit` by the number of customers when `cust` is less than 4 in the else condition inside the while loop.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperationsMaxProfit(int[] customers, int boardingCost, int runningCost) {
        int rotation = 0;
        int customerCount = 0;
        int profit = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int profitRotation = 0;
        int currentSeats = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
            customerCount += customers[i];
            rotation++;

            int currentProfit = 0;
            if (customerCount >= 4) {
                customerCount -= 4;
                currentSeats += 4;
            } else {
                currentSeats += customerCount;
                customerCount = 0;
            }
            currentProfit = currentSeats * boardingCost - rotation * runningCost;
            if (currentProfit > profit) {
                profit = currentProfit;
                profitRotation = rotation;
            }
        }
        while (customerCount > 0) {
            rotation++;

            int currentProfit = 0;
            if (customerCount >= 4) {
                customerCount -= 4;
                currentSeats -= 4;
            } else {
                currentSeats -= customerCount;
                customerCount = 0;
            }
            currentProfit = currentSeats * boardingCost - rotation * runningCost;

            if (currentProfit > profit) {
                profit = currentProfit;
                profitRotation = rotation;
            }
        }
        if (profit > 0) return profitRotation;
        return -1;
    }
}
```
