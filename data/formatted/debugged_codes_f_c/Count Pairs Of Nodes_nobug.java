Bug Type: Missing semicolon inside the for loop

Reasoning: The error in the code is a missing semicolon at the end of the statement inside the for loop (`result += c`). In Java, each statement must end with a semicolon. Adding a semicolon at the end of the statement corrects this syntax error.

Additionally, the code does not follow consistent indentation, so indentation will be fixed as well.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
            result += c;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
