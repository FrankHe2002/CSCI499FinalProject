Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds Error

Reasoning: In the provided code, there is an index out of bounds error. In line 8, when checking the condition `arr[i - 1] <= k`, it is possible for `i` to be 0, leading to an attempt to access `arr[-1]` which is outside the valid index range. This will result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix: To fix the bug, we can start the loop from `i = 1` instead of `i = 0`. This will ensure that when accessing `arr[i - 1]`, it will always be within the valid bounds of the array.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr[0] > k) {
            return k;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i - 1] <= k) {
                k++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return k;
    }
}
```
