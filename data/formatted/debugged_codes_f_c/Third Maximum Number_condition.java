The bug in the provided code is that it doesn't handle the case where the input array `nums` has less than 3 distinct elements. In this case, the code returns the first maximum element as the third maximum, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we can add a check at the end of the code to see if the third maximum element is null. If it is null, it means there were not enough distinct elements in the array, so we can return the maximum element as the result.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        Integer first = null, second = null, third = null;
        for (Integer num : nums) {
            if (num.equals(first) || num.equals(second) || num.equals(third))
                continue;
            if (first == null || num > first) {
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = num;
            } else if (second == null || num > second) {
                third = second;
                second = num;
            } else if (third == null || num > third) {
                third = num;
            }
        }
        return (third != null) ? third : first;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, after the loop ends, we check if `third` is still null. If it is, we return `first` as the third maximum element.
