The bug in the provided Java code is that the `defangIPaddr` method is missing a closing parenthesis after the closing double quotation mark in the `replace` method. This results in a syntax error.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public String defangIPaddr(String address) {
        return address.replace(".", "[.]");
    }
}
```
