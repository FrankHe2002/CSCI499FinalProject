Bug Type: Logic Error

In the provided buggy code, the `max` variable is not accurately counting the maximum depth of parentheses. The issue arises when updating the `max` variable. The code uses `max = Math.max(count, max)`, which compares the current depth `count` with the previous maximum depth `max`. However, this logic is incorrect because it does not consider the effect of nested parentheses.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to only update `max` when encountering an opening parenthesis (i.e., `(`). This ensures that nested parentheses are correctly accounted for. The `max` variable should only be updated if `count` is greater than the current value of `max`. Thus, we need to add a condition to the `if` statement to make the update only occur when `count` is greater than `max`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(String s) {
        int count = 0;   //count current depth of "()"
        int max = 0;     //count max depth of "()"

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
                count++;
                if (count > max) {
                    max = count;
                }
            } else if (s.charAt(i) == ')') {
                count--;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
