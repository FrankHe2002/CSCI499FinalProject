Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning:
The loop in question is iterating from `1` to `stockPrices.length - 1`, which suggests that the array `stockPrices` has at least 3 rows. However, the initial condition `if (stockPrices.length != 1) return 0;` implies that the length of `stockPrices` should be exactly `1`. This contradictory condition is causing the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to access elements at indices `i + 1` in the loop.

Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition to `if (stockPrices.length < 3) return 0;`. This ensures that the array `stockPrices` has at least 3 rows before entering the loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 57 ms (Top 71.43%) | Memory: 109.9 MB (Top 23.21%)
class Solution {
    public int minimumLines(int[][] stockPrices) {
        if (stockPrices.length < 3) return 0;
        int count = 1;
        Arrays.sort(stockPrices, (o1, o2) -> o1[0] - o2[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < stockPrices.length - 1; i++) {
            int x1 = stockPrices[i - 1][0];
            int y1 = stockPrices[i - 1][1];
            int x2 = stockPrices[i][0];
            int y2 = stockPrices[i][1];
            int x3 = stockPrices[i + 1][0];
            int y3 = stockPrices[i + 1][1];
            if (((x3 - x2) * (y2 - y1)) == ((y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1))) continue;

            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
