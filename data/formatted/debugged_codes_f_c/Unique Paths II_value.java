Buggy Code Explanation:

The bug in the provided code is in the nested for loop. In the second for loop, the loop condition is `j < n`, which includes an extra iteration where `j` is equal to `n`, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when accessing `obstacleGrid[i][j]`.

To fix this, we need to change the loop condition to `j < n - 1` to iterate only within the valid range of `j`. Additionally, we need to fix the condition inside the nested if statement. Instead of checking if `obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1`, we need to check if `obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1` because `obstacleGrid[i][j]` represents the current element, not `obstacleGrid[i][-1]`.

Lastly, the return statement tries to access `path[-- m][-- n]`, which is an unnecessary operation and can be simplified. We can directly access `path[m - 1][n - 1]` to get the final result.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length, n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        int[][] path = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // if there is an obstacle at the current block then you cannot get there
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1) {
                    if (i == 0 && j == 0)
                        path[i][j] = 1;
                    if (i > 0)
                        path[i][j] += path[i - 1][j];
                    if (j > 0)
                        path[i][j] += path[i][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return path[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
```
