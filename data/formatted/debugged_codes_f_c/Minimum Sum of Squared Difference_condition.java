Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: When reviewing the code, there is a syntax error on line 19. The statement `result += c` is missing a semicolon at the end. In Java, each statement must end with a semicolon to indicate its completion.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
            result += c;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
