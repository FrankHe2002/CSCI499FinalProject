Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The buggy code attempts to find two single numbers in an array. However, the logic for splitting the array into two groups based on the rightmost bit is incorrect. The code mistakenly checks if a number in the array has the rightmost bit set to 1, rather than checking if it is equal to the rightmost bit. This leads to incorrect grouping and calculation of the single numbers.

Fix:
- Update the condition in the second for-loop to check if the number is equal to the rightmost bit, rather than checking if it has the rightmost bit set.
- Add missing semicolons at the end of the lines where `xor ^= num` and `rightmostBit = rightmostBit << 1` are assigned.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int xor = 0;
        for (int num : nums) xor ^= num;

        // Find which rightmost bit is set to 1
        int rightmostBit = 1;
        while ((rightmostBit & xor) != rightmostBit) rightmostBit = rightmostBit << 1;

        // Split nums array into 2 group based on rightmost bit set
        int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if ((num & rightmostBit) == rightmostBit) num1 ^= num;
            else num2 ^= num;
        }
        return new int[] {num1, num2};
    }
}
