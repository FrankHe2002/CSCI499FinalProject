The bug in the provided Java code is in the line `seen = seen | (2 << ci);`. 

Bug Type:
The bug is caused by a logical error. The bitwise OR (`|`) operator is used incorrectly.

Reasoning:
The code is attempting to set the `ci`-th bit of the `seen` variable to 1, representing that the corresponding character has been seen in the sentence. However, the logic is incorrect because `(2 << ci)` does not set the `ci`-th bit. Instead, it sets the `ci + 1`-th bit since the left shift operator (`<<`) multiplies the current value by 2. Additionally, the bitwise OR operation (`|`) is not appropriate here since it will set multiple bits to 1 instead of just the `ci`-th bit.

Fix:
To fix this bug, the bitwise OR operation should be replaced with the bitwise OR assignment (`|=`) operator, and `(2 << ci)` should be changed to `(1 << ci)`. This will correctly set only the `ci`-th bit of the `seen` variable.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkIfPangram(String sentence) {
        int seen = 0;
        for (char c : sentence.toCharArray()) {
            int ci = c - 'a';
            seen |= (1 << ci);
        }
        return seen == ((1 << 26) - 1);
    }
}
```
