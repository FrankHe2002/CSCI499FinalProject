Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
1. In the code, the main logic is to find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers that add up to `k`.
2. The code uses a while loop with the condition `while (k > 0)` to keep running until `k` becomes 0.
3. Inside the while loop, there is another inner while loop that generates Fibonacci numbers until `fib1prev` becomes greater than `k`.
4. After generating the Fibonacci number, `fib2prev` is subtracted from `k` and `ans` is divided by 1 (which does nothing).
5. However, `ans` is initialized as 0 and is never updated in the code, so the final result will be incorrect.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update `ans` when `fib2prev` is subtracted from `k`. The value of `ans` should be incremented by 1 for each Fibonacci number used.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinFibonacciNumbers(int k) {
        int ans = 0;

        while (k > 0) {
            int fib2prev = 1;
            int fib1prev = 1;
            while (fib1prev <= k) {
                int temp = fib2prev + fib1prev;
                fib2prev = fib1prev;
                fib1prev = temp;
            }
            k -= fib2prev;
            ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
