Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
- The buggy code is the implementation of the `CBTInserter` class, which is a binary tree inserter.
- The bug is a logical error in the calculation of the index during insertion (`insertBinary` method).
- The current calculation of the index using `left`, `right`, and `mid` is incorrect and does not accurately determine the position for insertion.

Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to correctly calculate the index for insertion in the binary tree.
- We can modify the `insertBinary` method to use a recursive approach, traversing the binary tree until we reach the correct position for insertion.
- We can pass the current `depth` as an additional parameter to keep track of the level of the tree.
- If the current `depth` is equal to 1, we know we have reached the correct position, and we can insert the new `TreeNode` accordingly.
- Otherwise, we calculate which sub-tree (left or right) the new `TreeNode` should be inserted into based on the index value `k`.
- After inserting the new `TreeNode`, we need to update the total count of nodes in the binary tree.
- Finally, we update the return statement to return the value of the parent node.

Fixed Code:
```java
class CBTInserter {

    private TreeNode root;
    private int total;

    private int count(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        return 1 + count(root.left) + count(root.right);
    }

    public CBTInserter(TreeNode root) {
        this.root = root;
        total = count(root);
    }

    private int insertBinary(TreeNode root, int val, int k, int depth) {
        if (depth == 1) {
            if (k == 0) {
                TreeNode newNode = new TreeNode(val);
                newNode.left = root.left;
                root.left = newNode;
            } else {
                TreeNode newNode = new TreeNode(val);
                newNode.left = root.right;
                root.right = newNode;
            }
            return root.val;
        }
        
        int leftCount = count(root.left);
        int rightCount = count(root.right);
        int totalCount = leftCount + rightCount;

        int leftSubtreeSize = (1 << (depth - 2));
        int rightSubtreeSize = (1 << (depth - 1)) - 1 - leftSubtreeSize;

        if (k < leftSubtree
