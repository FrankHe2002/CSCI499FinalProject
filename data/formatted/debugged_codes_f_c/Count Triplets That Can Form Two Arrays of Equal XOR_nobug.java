Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code tries to count the number of triplets in the given array where the bitwise XOR of the triplet is 0.
2. The outer loop iterates over each element in the array.
3. The inner loop iterates over the elements starting from the current element.
4. The variable `val` is used to calculate the XOR of the elements in the current subarray.

Issue:

The XOR value (`val`) is not being reset to 0 after each iteration of the inner loop. As a result, the XOR value from previous subarrays is carried over to the next subarrays, leading to incorrect counts of triplets.

Fix:

Reset the value of `val` to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 85.89%) | Memory: 41.5 MB (Top 67.63%)
class Solution {
    public int countTriplets(int[] arr) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int val = 0;
            for (int k = i; k < arr.length; k++) {
                val = val ^ arr[k];
                if (val == 0) count += k - i + 1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
