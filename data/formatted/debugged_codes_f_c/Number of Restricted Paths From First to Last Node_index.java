Bug Type: Compilation Error

Reasoning: The bug type in the provided code is a Compilation Error. The error occurs in the following line:

```java
        graph.putIfAbsent(e[newNode], new HashMap<>());
```

There is no variable named "newNode" defined in the code. It seems to be a typo and should be replaced with "e[0]" to access the first element of the "e" array.

Fix:

```java
        graph.putIfAbsent(e[0], new HashMap<>());
```
