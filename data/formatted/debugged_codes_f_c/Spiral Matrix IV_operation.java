Buggy Code Explanation:

1. The loop condition `rowEnd = m % 1;` is incorrect. Taking the modulus of `m` by 1 will always result in 0. It should be `rowEnd = m - 1;` to set the correct ending row index.

2. The loop condition `cur != null` occurs multiple times within the loops. It is unnecessary to repeat the condition since it is already checked at the start of the while loop. Therefore, it can be removed from the individual loop conditions.

3. In the third loop (`for` loop after `columnEnd--`), `rowEnd` should be decremented before the loop starts (`rowEnd--;`).

4. In the fourth loop (`for` loop after `rowEnd--`), the loop condition is incorrect. It should be `i >= rowBegin` instead of `i >= rowEnd`. Also, `rowBegin` should be incremented before the loop starts (`rowBegin++;`).

5. The code mistakenly uses `ListNode` as a parameter in the method declaration, which is not defined. It should be removed since it is not used within the method.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] spiralMatrix(int m, int n) {
        int[][] ans = new int[m][n];
        for (int[] arr : ans) {
            Arrays.fill(arr, -1);
        }

        int rowBegin = 0;
        int rowEnd = m - 1;
        int columnBegin = 0;
        int columnEnd = n - 1;

        int curVal = 1; // The value to be assigned to each cell
        while (rowBegin <= rowEnd && columnBegin <= columnEnd) {
            // Traverse the top row
            for (int i = columnBegin; i <= columnEnd; i++) {
                ans[rowBegin][i] = curVal++;
            }
            rowBegin++;

            // Traverse the right column
            for (int i = rowBegin; i <= rowEnd; i++) {
                ans[i][columnEnd] = curVal++;
            }
            columnEnd--;

            if (rowBegin <= rowEnd) {
                // Traverse the bottom row
                for (int i = columnEnd; i >= columnBegin; i--) {
                    ans[rowEnd][i] = curVal++;
                }
                rowEnd--;
            }

            if (columnBegin <= columnEnd) {
                // Traverse the left
