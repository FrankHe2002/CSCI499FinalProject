Bug type: Logical error.

Explanation: The logical error in the provided code is the incorrect calculation of `tempcost` and `ans`. 

1. `tempcost` is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the characters in the strings `s` and `t`. However, the code does not handle the case when the difference is greater than `maxCost`. 

2. `ans` is updated by calculating the length of the substring between `l` and `r`. However, this calculation is incorrect because `r` is not the ending index of the substring.

To fix the bug:
1. Initialize `tempcost` as 0 and calculate the absolute difference between the characters at the corresponding indexes, `r`. If the difference is greater than `maxCost`, subtract the difference from `tempcost` and increment `l` until `tempcost` is less than or equal to `maxCost`.

2. Update `ans` as `Math.max(ans, r - l + 1)` to calculate the correct length of the substring.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int ans = 0;
        int tempcost = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = 0;
        for (; r < s.length(); r++) {
            tempcost += Math.abs(s.charAt(r) - t.charAt(r));
            while (tempcost > maxCost) {
                tempcost -= Math.abs(s.charAt(l) - t.charAt(l));
                l++;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, r - l + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
