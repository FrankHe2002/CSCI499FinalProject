Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided buggy code has one main issue. The looping condition in the for loop is incorrect. It currently uses `i < patterns.length`, which is correct for iterating through all the patterns. However, the loop condition should be `i < patterns.length` instead of `i < patterns.length`. This is because the array indices range from 0 to `length - 1`, so using `<=` will cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Bug Type:
The bug in the code can be categorized as an off-by-one error.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfStrings(String[] patterns, String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < patterns.length; i++) {
            if (word.contains(patterns[i])) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
