Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code has an issue with the initialization of `dp[0]`. It sets `dp[0]` to `2`, which is incorrect. The code is supposed to store the number of coins required to make the amount `i`. Since `dp[0]` represents the number of coins required to make an amount of 0, it should be initialized to `0`, not `2`. 

Buggy Code Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        // for each coin iteration : dp[i] = number of coins required to make i with coins [0...coin]
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
}
```
