Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The bug is a logical error in the calculation of the product and sum. The code correctly calculates the sum of the digits, but it incorrectly calculates the product of the digits. The calculation `mul = mul * (n % 10);` should be changed to `mul = mul * (n % 10);`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 39.3 MB (Top 90.51%)
class Solution {
    public int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int mul = 1, sum = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            sum = sum + n % 10;
            mul = mul * (n % 10);
            n = n / 10;
        }
        return mul - sum;
    }
}
```
