Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code tries to find the year with the maximum population based on an array of logs. It maintains an array called `year` to store the population count at each year. It iterates through the logs and updates the population count at the respective years. Then, it calculates the prefix sum of the `year` array and finds the year with the maximum population.

However, there is a bug in the code. It assumes that the range of years is from 1950 to 2050 and initializes the `year` array with a size of 2051. However, the given for-loop condition `for (int i = 1951; i < year.length; i++)` assumes that the range of years starts from 1951, which is incorrect. This can cause incorrect calculations and lead to incorrect results.

Bug Type:
The bug in this code is a logical error.

Fix and Updated Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 78.61%) | Memory: 42.6 MB (Top 29.91%)
class Solution {
    public int maximumPopulation(int[][] logs) {

        int[] year = new int[2051];

        // O(n) -> n is log.length

        for (int[] log : logs) {

            year[log[0]] += 1;
            year[log[1]] -= 1;
        }

        int maxNum = year[1950], maxYear = 1950;

        // O(100) -> 2050 - 1950 = 100

        for (int i = 1950; i < year.length; i++) { // Updated loop condition
            year[i] += year[i - 1]; // Generating Prefix Sum

            if (year[i] > maxNum) {
                maxNum = year[i];
                maxYear = i;
            }
        }

        return maxYear;
    }
}
```

Explanation of the Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the loop condition in the second for-loop to start from the correct year, which is 1950. This ensures that we iterate over all the valid years in the `year` array. By updating the condition to `for (int i = 1950; i < year.length; i++)`, we start the loop from the correct index and calculate the prefix sum correctly.
