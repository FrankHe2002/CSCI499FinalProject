Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: 

Based on the context and logic, the variable name `the` in the line `if (nums[the] > nums[mid + 1])` appears to be a typo and is causing a syntax error. It should likely be `nums[mid]` instead.

Fix:

Replace `the` with `mid` in the line `if (nums[the] > nums[mid + 1])`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                //It means that we are in decreasing part of the array
                end = mid;
            } else {
                //It means that we are in increasing part of the array
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```
