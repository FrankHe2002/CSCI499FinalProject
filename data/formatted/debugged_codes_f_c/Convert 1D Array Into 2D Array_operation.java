Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is that the condition `m % n != original.length` is incorrect. The condition should check whether the product of `m` and `n` is equal to `original.length`, not the remainder. If the condition is not satisfied, the code returns an empty 2D array (`new int[0][0]`), which is incorrect based on the given requirements.

Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Fix and Explanation:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition from `m % n != original.length` to `m * n != original.length`. This properly checks whether the product of `m` and `n` is equal to `original.length`. With this fix, the code will return the correctly constructed 2D array or an empty 2D array as required.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] construct2DArray(int[] original, int m, int n) {
        if (m * n != original.length) {
            return new int[0][0];
        }
        int[][] answer = new int[m][n];
        int rCount = 0, cCount = 0, len = original.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            answer[rCount][cCount++] = original[i];
            if (cCount == n) {
                rCount++;
                cCount = 0;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
