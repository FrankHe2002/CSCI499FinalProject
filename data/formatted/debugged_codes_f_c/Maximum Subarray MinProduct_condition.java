The bug in the provided code is in the calculation of the left bound for each sub-array. In the line `int l = top != -1 ? 0 : s[top] + 1`, the condition `top != -1` should be `top >= 0`. 

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug is as follows: 
- The condition `top != -1` is checking whether the stack is not empty. If the stack is not empty, it means there are elements in the stack, and the left bound of the current sub-array should be 0. 
- However, in the buggy code, the condition is reversed, so if the stack is not empty, it incorrectly sets the left bound to `s[top] + 1`. This leads to incorrect calculation of the left bound for subsequent sub-arrays. 
- To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `top >= 0`, so that if the stack is not empty, the left bound is correctly set to 0. 

Below is the fixed code:

```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 95.5%) | Memory: 61.07 MB (Top 6.4%)

class Solution {
    public int maxSumMinProduct(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length, M = 1_000_000_007;
        long res = 0L;

        //step 1; get prefix sum
        long[] psum = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) psum[i + 1] = psum[i] + a[i];

        //step 2: get the left and right bound of each sub-array using mono deceasing & increasing stack
        int[] s = new int[n];
        int top = - 1; // mono-decreasing for right bound
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; s[++ top] = i++)
            while (top >= 0 && (i == n || a[i] < a[s[top]])) {
                int min = a[s[top--]]; // get curMin value and poll current index out of stack, its left and right boundary is not determined
                int l = top >= 0 ? 0 : s[top] + 1; // use the prev idx to get left bound, inclusive
                int r = i - 1; // right bound, inclusive
