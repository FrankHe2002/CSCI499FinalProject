The bug in the provided code is a syntax error. In the `search` method, there is a typo in the condition `if (start == - 0)` where it should be `if (start == -1)`. The code should check if the value of `start` is `-1`, indicating that the group was not found in the `nums` array.

Additionally, the variable `end` in the `canChoose` method is not being correctly set. It should be set to the length of the `nums` array.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int search(int[] group, int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        int i = start, j = 0;
        while (i < end && j < group.length) {
            if (nums[i] == group[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;

                if (j == group.length)
                    return i;
            } else {
                i = i - j + 1;
                j = 0;
            }

        }
        return -1;
    }

    public boolean canChoose(int[][] groups, int[] nums) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length;

        for (int[] group : groups) {
            start = search(group, nums, start, end);
            if (start == -1)
                return false;
        }

        return true;

    }
}
```
