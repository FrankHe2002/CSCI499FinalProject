Bug Type: Out of Bounds Error

Reasoning: The code uses nested loops to iterate over the matrix `mat`. Inside the nested loops, it has two additional loops (`x` and `y`) that are meant to iterate over a submatrix based on the indices `p`, `q`, `i+k`, and `j+k`. However, there is a bug in the conditions of the inner loops. 

The condition `y > n` is incorrect because `n` represents the number of columns in `mat`, so the valid column indices range from 0 to `n-1`. The condition should be `y < n` instead.

Additionally, the conditions `p < 0` and `q < 0` are incorrect because they should ensure that `p` and `q` are at least 0, i.e., within the valid range of indices. The correct conditions should be `p < 0` and `q < 0`, ensuring that `p` and `q` are set to 0 when their values go below 0.

    public int[][] matrixBlockSum(int[][] mat, int k) {
        int m = mat.length, n = mat[0].length;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int val = 0;
                int p = i - k, q = j - k;
                p = Math.max(0, p); // Ensure p is not less than 0
                q = Math.max(0, q); // Ensure q is not less than 0
                for (int x = p; x <= i + k && x < m; x++) {
                    for (int y = q; y <= j + k && y < n; y++) { // Corrected condition y < n
                        val += mat[x][y];
                    }
                }
                answer[i][j] = val;
            }
        }
        return answer;
