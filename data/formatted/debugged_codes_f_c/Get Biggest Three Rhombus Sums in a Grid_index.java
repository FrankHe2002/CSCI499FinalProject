Bug Type: Syntax Error, Array Index Out of Bounds, Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The code has a few syntax errors, such as missing semicolons and a missing closing parenthesis.
2. The code also has an array index out of bounds error due to the use of the `edge` variable, which is undefined.
3. There is a logical error in the `getBiggestThree` method's return statement, where it returns an array with incorrect indices when there are less than three distinct values.

Fix:
1. Add the missing semicolons and the missing closing parenthesis.
2. Replace the `edge` variable with the correct index, which should be `0`.
3. Adjust the return statement in the `getBiggestThree` method to return the correct indices based on the number of distinct values found.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] getBiggestThree(int[][] grid) {
        int end = Math.min(grid.length, grid[0].length);
        int maxThree[] = {0, 0, 0};
        for (int length = 0; length < end; length++) {
            searchBigThree(grid, maxThree, length);
        }

        Arrays.sort(maxThree);

        // If there are less than three distinct values, return all of them.
        if (maxThree[0] == 0) {
            if (maxThree[1] == 0) {
                return new int[] {maxThree[2]};
            }
            return new int[] {maxThree[2], maxThree[1]};
        }

        // reverse array
        maxThree[0] = maxThree[0] ^ maxThree[2];
        maxThree[2] = maxThree[0] ^ maxThree[2];
        maxThree[0] = maxThree[0] ^ maxThree[2];

        return maxThree;
    }

    void searchBigThree(int[][] grid, int[] maxThree, int length) {
        int end = grid.length - (length == 0 ? 0 : 2 * length);
        int end1 = grid[0].length - (length);
        for (int start = 0; start < end; start++) {
            for (int start1 = length; start1 < end1; start1++) {
                if (start + start1 >= length) {
                    addToMaxThree(maxThree, getSum(grid, start,
