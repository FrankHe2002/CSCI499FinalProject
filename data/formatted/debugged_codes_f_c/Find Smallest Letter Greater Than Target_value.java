Bug Type: Array Index Error

Reasoning: In the provided code, the `end` variable is initialized as `letters.length - 2`. This means that the last element of the `letters` array is not considered in the binary search. As a result, if the `target` letter is greater than all the letters in the array, the loop will continue indefinitely, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to access `letters[start % letters.length]` where `start` becomes greater than `end`. 

Fix: 

1. To fix this bug, the `end` variable initialization should be changed to `letters.length - 1`. This allows the loop to consider all elements in the `letters` array.
2. Additionally, to handle the case where the `target` letter is greater than all the letters in the array, an additional condition should be added after the loop to check if the start index has exceeded the array bounds. In that case, the desired behavior is to wrap around and return the first letter of the array. This can be achieved using the modulo operator `%`.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int start = 0, end = letters.length - 1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] > target) {
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return letters[start % letters.length];
    }
}
```
