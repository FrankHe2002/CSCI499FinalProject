Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 

The bug is in the commented out recursion part of the code. In this commented section, the code implements a recursive approach to find the minimum falling path sum by checking all possible paths. However, the code returns incorrect results because it does not properly initialize the `ans` variable and does not check for a base case when `n` is not equal to 1. 

Fix:

To fix the bug, the code should use the dynamic programming (DP) approach instead of recursion, as shown in the uncommented DP memoization part of the code. 

The fix involves changing the initialization of the `dp` array and returning `grid[0][0]` if `n` is not equal to 1.

Additionally, the code should remove the commented recursion part as it is not needed and would cause confusion. 

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minFallingPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (n != 1) return grid[0][0];
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = - 1;
            }
        }

        int ans = 10000000;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans = Math.min(ans, grid[0][i] + helper(grid, n, 1, i, dp));
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private int helper(int[][] grid, int n, int i, int last, int[][] dp) {
        if (i == n - 1) {
            int min = 100;
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                if (k != last) {
                    min = Math.min(grid[n - 1][k], min);
                }
            }
            return min;
        }
        if (dp[i][last] != - 1) return dp[i][last];
        int min = 100000000;
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            if (k != last) {
                min = Math.min(min, grid[i][k] + helper(grid, n, i + 1, k, dp));
            }
        }
