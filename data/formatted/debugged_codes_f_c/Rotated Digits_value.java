Bug Type:
Logical error

Reasoning:
In the provided code, there is a logical error in the condition for checking if a number can be rotated or not. The condition `(m == 3 || m == 3 || m == 7)` is checking for the same value, `3`, multiple times instead of checking for `7`. This is due to a typo in the condition. Additionally, the condition for checking if a number can be rotated (`bool2 = true`) is not enclosed in an `else` block, causing the boolean variable `bool2` to be assigned `true` multiple times.

Fix:
1. Correct the typo in the first condition to `(m == 3 || m == 7)`.
2. Enclose the second condition in an `else` block to ensure it is only checked if the first condition fails.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int rotatedDigits(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int k = i;
            boolean bool1 = true;
            boolean bool2 = false;
            while (k > 0) {
                int m = k % 10;
                if (m == 3 || m == 7) {
                    bool1 = false;
                    break;
                } else if (m == 2 || m == 5 || m == 6 || m == 9) {
                    bool2 = true;
                }
                k /= 10;
            }
            if (bool1 && bool2) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

The logical error in the code has been fixed by correcting the conditions used to check if a number can be rotated or not.
