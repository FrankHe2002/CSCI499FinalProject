Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: 
The bug occurs in the loop where each string in `s` is split and processed. The bug is caused by incorrectly accessing the array index in `res`. In this code, the index is calculated as `st.charAt(st.length() - 1) - '1'`, which assumes that the last character of each string in `s` is a digit (representing the correct position in the resulting array). However, this assumption is incorrect, and it results in accessing an index out of the array's bounds.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the index calculation so that it correctly extracts the position from each string. We can use `Integer.parseInt(st.charAt(st.length() - 1) + "") - 1` to extract the last character as a string, parse it as an integer, and subtract 1 to calculate the correct index.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String sortSentence(String s) {
        String[] res = new String[s.split(" ").length];
        for (String st : s.split(" ")) {
            res[Integer.parseInt(st.charAt(st.length() - 1) + "") - 1] = st.substring(0, st.length() - 1);
        }
        return String.join(" ", res);
    }
}
```
