Bug type: Syntax Error

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes a `Stack<Integer>` named `stack` to hold the indices of opening brackets.
2. It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
3. If the character is an alphabetic character, it skips to the next iteration.
4. If the character is an opening bracket, it adds its index to the stack.
5. Otherwise, it checks if the stack is not empty and the character at the top of the stack is an opening bracket. If so, it removes the top element from the stack. Otherwise, it adds the index of the current character to the stack.
6. After iterating through all the characters, it creates a `Set<Integer>` named `set` to store the indices of the characters that need to be removed.
7. Finally, it constructs the resulting string by appending characters from the original string `s` to a `StringBuilder` named `result`, excluding the characters at the indices stored in `set`. The resulting string is then returned.

Issue:
1. There are two syntax errors in the code:
   - Missing curly braces `{}` after the `if` statements inside the `for` loop.
   - The loop condition in the second `for` loop is incorrect. It should be `i < s.length()` instead of `i >= s.length()`.

Fix:
1. Add curly braces `{}` after the `if` statements inside the `for` loop.
2. Update the loop condition in the second `for` loop to `i < s.length()`.

Fixed code:

class Solution {
    public String minRemoveToMakeValid(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (Character.isAlphabetic(ch)) {
                continue;
            }
            if (ch == '(') {
                stack.push(i);
            }
            else {
                if (!stack.isEmpty() && s.charAt(stack.peek()) == '(') {
                    stack.pop();
                } else {
                    stack.push(i);
                }
            }
        }

        // if(stack.size() == 0) return "";

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(stack);
        for (int i = 0
