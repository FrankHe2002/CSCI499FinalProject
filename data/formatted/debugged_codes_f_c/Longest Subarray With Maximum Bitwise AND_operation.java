Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The code is designed to find the length of the longest subarray in the given array `nums`, where all the elements are equal to the maximum element `max` in the array. The code initializes variables `result`, `length`, and `max` to 0. It then iterates over the elements of `nums` twice. In the first iteration, it finds the maximum element in `nums` and assigns it to `max`. In the second iteration, it checks if the current element is equal to `max`. If it is, it increments `length` and updates `result` if `length` becomes greater than `result`. If the current element is not equal to `max`, it resets `length` to 0.

However, there is a logical error in this code. When the code encounters an element that is not equal to `max`, it immediately resets `length` to 0. This is incorrect because if there is a subsequent sequence of elements that are equal to `max`, it will not be counted correctly. The code should only reset `length` to 0 when it encounters an element that is not equal to `max` immediately after a sequence of elements that are equal to `max`.

Fix:
To fix this issue, we can introduce a new variable `prev` to keep track of the previous element. Inside the second loop, we check if the current element is equal to `max` and the previous element is also equal to `max`. If this condition is true, we increment `length`. Otherwise, we reset `length` to 0 and update `prev` to the current element. This ensures that `length` is only incremented when we have a sequence of elements equal to `max`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0, length = 0, max = 0;
        for (int ele : nums) {
            max = Math.max(max, ele);
        }

        int prev = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int ele : nums) {
            if (ele == max && prev == max) {
                length++;
            } else {
                length = 0;
            }
            prev = ele;
            result = Math.max(result, length);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
