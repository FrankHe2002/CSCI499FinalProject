The bug in the provided buggy Java code is in the condition `! insidePipe && s.charAt(i) != '*'`. The code incorrectly increments `count` when `insidePipe` is `false` and the current character is not `'*'`. However, the correct behavior should be to increment `count` when `insidePipe` is `true` and the current character is not `'*'`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `insidePipe` is `true` and the current character is not `'*'`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 7 ms (Top 7.47%) | Memory: 42.1 MB (Top 50.88%)
class Solution {
    public int countAsterisks(String s) {
        boolean insidePipe = false;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '|') {
                insidePipe = !insidePipe;
            }
            if (insidePipe && s.charAt(i) != '*') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
