The bug in the provided code is an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The loop condition `i < seats.length` iterates over the `seats` array, but on each iteration, it accesses the `i + 1` index of the `students` array. This results in accessing an index out of bounds.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the loop condition to `i < students.length`, ensuring that the loop iterates over both arrays within their valid bounds.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 99.78%) | Memory: 41.7 MB (Top 99.11%)
class Solution {
    public int minMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        Arrays.sort(seats);
        Arrays.sort(students);
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
            diff += Math.abs(students[i] - seats[i]);
        }
        return diff;
    }
}
```
