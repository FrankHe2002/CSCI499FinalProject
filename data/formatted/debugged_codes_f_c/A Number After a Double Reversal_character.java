Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error. The condition `num % 10 != 0 || num < 10` checks if the last digit of `num` is not zero or if `num` is less than 10. This condition does not accurately determine if `num` is the same after being reversed. For example, if `num` is 20, the condition will return `true` even though the reverse of 20 is 02, which is not equal to 20. 

To fix this bug, we need to implement the correct logic for determining if `num` is the same after being reversed. One way to do this is by using a separate variable to store the reverse of `num` and then compare it with `num`. 

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameAfterReversals(int num) {
        int original = num;
        int reverse = 0;
        
        while (num != 0) {
            reverse = reverse * 10 + num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        
        return original == reverse;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
The fixed code introduces two additional variables: `original` to store the original value of `num`, and `reverse` to store the reverse of `num`. 

Inside the `while` loop, we continuously update the `reverse` variable by multiplying it by 10 and adding the last digit of `num` (obtained using `num % 10`). We also divide `num` by 10 to remove the last digit.

After the `while` loop, we compare `original` with `reverse` to determine if `num` is the same after being reversed. If they are equal, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.
