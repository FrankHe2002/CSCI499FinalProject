Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The purpose of the code is to find the length of the shortest subarray that, if sorted, would make the entire array sorted. However, the code has a logical error in finding the starting index (`s`) and ending index (`e`) of the subarray. The logic compares the sorted array (`nums`) with the original array (`numsClone`) but doesn't consider the possibility that the subarray might be located in the middle of the array. Additionally, the logic assumes that `s` will always be less than or equal to `e`, which may not be the case.

Fix:
1. Initialize `s = -1` and `e = -1` to represent that a subarray has not been found yet.
2. Iterate over the array and compare elements of `nums` with `numsClone` to find the first and last indices that differ.
3. Update `s` and `e` accordingly.
4. After the loop, check if `s` and `e` have been updated. If not, return 0 as there is no unsorted subarray.
5. Return `e - s + 1` to get the length of the unsorted subarray.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 99.96%) | Memory: 40.3 MB (Top 89.25%)
class Solution {
    public int findUnsortedSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int[] numsClone = nums.clone();
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int s = -1;
        int e = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (numsClone[i] != nums[i]) {
                if (s == -1) {
                    s = i;
                }
                e = i;
            }
        }

        if (s == -1 || e == -1) {
            return 0;
        }

        return e - s + 1;
    }
}
```
