Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: 
The buggy code causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` during the nested for loop iteration. The loop condition in the second nested for loop is `j >= m`, which prevents any iteration from occurring because `j` is set to `m` initially. Since `j` cannot be greater than or equal to `m`, the loop is skipped entirely, resulting in incorrect calculations and array index out of bounds errors. 

Fix:
Change the loop condition in the second nested for loop from `j >= m` to `j <= m`. This will allow proper iteration and prevent array index out of bounds errors.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 20 ms (Top 23.73%) | Memory: 46.5 MB (Top 77.36%)
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int n = word1.length();
        int m = word2.length();

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[0][i] = 0;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        int common = dp[n][m];
        return (n + m) - (2 * common);

    }
}
