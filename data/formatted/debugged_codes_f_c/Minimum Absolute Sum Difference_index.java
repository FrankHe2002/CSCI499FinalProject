Bug Type: Array Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning: The bug is caused by the loop condition `i < nums2.length` at the line `for (int i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++)`, which iterates over `nums2`. However, inside the loop, the code accesses the corresponding elements of `nums1` using `nums1[i]`. If `nums1` and `nums2` have different lengths and `nums2` is longer, it will result in an array out of bounds exception. 

Fix: Change the loop condition to `i < Math.min(nums1.length, nums2.length)`. This ensures that the loop doesn't exceed the length of the shorter array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minAbsoluteSumDiff(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;

        // Sorted copy of nums1 to use for binary search
        int[] snums1 = nums1.clone();
        Arrays.sort(snums1);

        int maxDiff = 0;    // maximum difference between original and new absolute diff
        int pos = 0;        // where the maximum difference occurs
        int newn1 = 0;      // nums1 value to copy to nums1[pos - 1]

        // For each array position i from 0 to n-1, find up to two elements
        // in nums1 that are closest to nums2[i] (one on each side of nums2[i]).
        // Calculate a new absolute difference for each of these elements.
        for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(nums1.length, nums2.length); i++) {
            int n2 = nums2[i];
            int origDiff = Math.abs(nums1[i] - n2);

            // Find the largest element in nums1 that is less than or equal to
            // the current element in nums2, if such an element exists.
            int floor = arrayFloor(snums1, n2);
            if (floor > Integer.MIN_VALUE) {
                // If a valid element exists, calculate a new absolute difference
                // at the current position, and calculate how much smaller this is
                // than the current absolute difference. If the result is better
                // than what we have seen so far, update the maximum difference and
                // save the data for the current position.
                int newDiff = Math
