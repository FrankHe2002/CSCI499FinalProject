Bug Type:
Syntax Error, Missing Parentheses

Reasoning:
The error in the provided code is a missing closing parenthesis `)` in both for loops. Each for loop should have two closing parentheses to close the loop statement, but there is only one closing parenthesis in each loop. This results in a syntax error.

Fix:
The fix for this bug is to add the missing closing parenthesis `)` at the end of each for loop statement.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for (char cs : s.toCharArray()) c ^= cs;
        for (char ct : t.toCharArray()) c ^= ct;
        return c;
    }
}
```
