Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
1. The code defines a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m` and `n`.
2. In the `maxMoves` method, the base case `if (dp[3][y] != -1)` is checking if the value at index `[3][y]` is not equal to `-1`. This implies that the size of the `dp` array is expected to have a length of at least 4. However, this contradicts the definition of the `dp` array as `new int[m][n]`, which means it has dimensions `m` and `n`.
3. The loop `for (var i = 0; i < m; i++)` iterates `i` from 0 to `m-1`, which means it does not access the value at `dp[3][y]`. Therefore, the condition `if (dp[3][y] != -1)` will always be false, and the execution of `dp[x][y] = 0;` line will never be reached.
4. Overall, the code is trying to access an index `[3][y]` of the `dp` array, which is out of bounds.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the `dp` array initialization to `new int[m][n+1]` to include an additional column.
2. Update the condition in the base case to `if (dp[x][y] != -1)` to check if the value at index `[x][y]` is not equal to `-1`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    int[][] dp;
    int[] dirs = new int[] {- 1, 0, 1};
    int m, n, max = 0;

    private int maxMoves(int[][] grid, int x, int y) {
        if (y == n - 1) return 0;

        if (dp[x][y] != -1) return dp[x][y];

        dp[x][y] = 0;
        for (var dir : dirs) {
            var x2 = x + dir;
            if (x2 < 0 || x2 == m) continue;

            if (grid[x2][y + 1] > grid[x][y])
                dp[x][y] = Math.max(dp[x][y], 1 + maxMoves(grid, x2,
