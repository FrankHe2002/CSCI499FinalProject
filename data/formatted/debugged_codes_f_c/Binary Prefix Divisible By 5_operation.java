Bug Type: Mathematical Error

Reasoning: The provided buggy code attempts to determine if each prefix of the given `nums` array is divisible by 5. However, the calculation of the `sum` is incorrect. The buggy code performs `(sum - 2 + nums[i]) % 5` to update the `sum` value, which is incorrect for finding divisibility by 5.

Fix: To fix the bug, we need to update how the `sum` is calculated. Instead of subtracting 2 from the previous `sum`, we need to multiply the previous `sum` by 2 and add `nums[i]`. This ensures that the `sum` represents the value of the binary number formed by the prefix of `nums`. Then we need to check if the updated `sum` is divisible by 5. If it is, we add `true` to the `list`, and if it's not, we add `false`.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> prefixesDivBy5(int[] nums) {
        List<Boolean> list = new ArrayList<>();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum = (sum * 2 + nums[i]) % 5;
            if (sum == 0) {
                list.add(true);
            } else {
                list.add(false);
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
}
```
