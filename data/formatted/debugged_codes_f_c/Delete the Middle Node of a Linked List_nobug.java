The bug in the provided Java code is that it does not handle the case where the "middle" node is the first node in the linked list. In this case, the `prev` pointer will be equal to `head`, and updating `prev.next` to `slow.next` will result in the first node being removed from the linked list. 

To fix this bug, we need to differentiate between the case where the "middle" node is the first node and the case where it is not. We can do this by adding an additional condition to check whether `prev` is equal to `head` before updating `prev.next`. If `prev` is equal to `head`, it means that the "middle" node is the first node, and we need to update `head` to remove the first node.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 7 ms (Top 31.33%) | Memory: 218.3 MB (Top 51.88%)
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteMiddle(ListNode head) {
        // Base Condition
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return null;
        // Pointers Created
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode prev = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        if (prev == head) {
            head = head.next;
        } else {
            prev.next = slow.next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```
