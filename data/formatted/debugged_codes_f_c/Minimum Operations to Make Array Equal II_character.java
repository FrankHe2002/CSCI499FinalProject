Bug Type: Syntax Error, Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. Syntax Error: Missing parentheses in the statement `if diff[i] % k != 0)`. There is a missing opening parenthesis after `if` and a missing closing parenthesis at the end of the condition.

2. Logical Error: The condition `if diff[i] % k != 0` is checking if the remainder of `diff[i]` divided by `k` is not equal to 0. However, the expected behavior is to check if the remainder is equal to 0. This means that if `diff[i]` is not divisible evenly by `k`, the condition should return -1.

Fix:

```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 93.2%) | Memory: 56.22 MB (Top 87.9%)

class Solution {
    public long minOperations(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        long[] diff = new long[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diff[i] = nums2[i] - nums1[i];
        }
        if (k == 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                if (diff[i] != 0) return - 1;
            return 0;
        }
        long ans = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += diff[i];
            if (diff[i] % k != 0) {
                return - 1;
            }
            ans += Math.abs(diff[i] / k);
        }

        return sum == 0 ? ans / 2 : - 1;
    }
}
```
