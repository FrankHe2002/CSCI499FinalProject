Bug Type: Logic error

Reasoning: The provided code only checks if `n` is divisible by 4 and returns `false` in that case. However, the Nim game is won by the player taking the last stone, which happens when `n` is not divisible by 4. Therefore, the condition should be inverted, returning `true` when `n` is not divisible by 4.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 40.8 MB (Top 59.25%)
class Solution {
    public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        if (n % 4 == 0) return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```
