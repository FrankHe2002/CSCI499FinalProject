Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 
The provided code is supposed to check if there exists an increasing triplet in the given array `nums`. However, the logic for finding the increasing triplet is incorrect. The logic assumes that if there is a number `i` in the array that is larger than `x` and `y`, then there must be an increasing triplet. This is not a valid assumption. There can be cases where the numbers after `i` are smaller than `x` or `y`, thus not forming an increasing triplet.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to find a valid increasing triplet. One way to do this is by keeping track of the smallest number (`x`), the second smallest number (`y`), and a potential third smallest number (`z`). We update `x` and `y` as we iterate through the array and check if there is a number greater than `x` and `y` to form the increasing triplet. If such a number is found, we can return `true`. 

If we reach the end of the loop without finding an increasing triplet, we return `false`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean increasingTriplet(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 3)
            return false;

        int x = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int y = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i <= x) {
                x = i;
            } else if (i <= y) {
                y = i;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
