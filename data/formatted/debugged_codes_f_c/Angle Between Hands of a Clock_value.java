The bug in the provided code is in the calculation of `hrPos`. It should be calculated using `(hour * 5 + minutes / 12.0)` instead of `5 * (hour % 12) + (5 * minutes / 60.0)`. 

Additionally, the calculation of `units` should be the difference between `minutes` and `hrPos` without taking the absolute value. 

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 38.2 MB (Top 38.02%)
class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        // Position of hour hand in a circle of 0 - 59
        double hrPos = hour * 5 + minutes / 12.0;

        // Take the min of distance between minute & hour hand and hour & minute hand
        return Math.min(minutes - hrPos, hrPos - minutes) * 6;
    }
}
```
