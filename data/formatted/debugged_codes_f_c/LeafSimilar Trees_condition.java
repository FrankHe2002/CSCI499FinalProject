Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

1. The method `getLeafNodes` is intended to perform an inorder traversal of the given binary tree and extract the leaf nodes in the specified sequence.
2. However, the code has a logical error in the base case condition `if (root != null) return;` at the beginning of the method.
3. This condition exits the method immediately when the `root` node is not `null`, resulting in premature termination of the method.
4. As a result, the leaf nodes are not properly processed and added to the `set`.
5. Additionally, the code is using an incorrect equality condition `set == null` instead of `set.size() == 0` to check if the `set` has been initialized.

Bug Fix:

To fix the logical error, the base case condition in the `getLeafNodes` method should be changed to `if (root == null) return;` This ensures that the method continues to execute when the `root` node is not `null`.

Furthermore, the condition for checking if the `set` has been initialized should be corrected to `set.size() == 0` instead of `set == null`.

Fixed Code:

        return set1.equals(set2); //At last we compare the two list formed and check the sequence
    }

    //The function below is to extract all the leaf nodes in the sequence mentioned in the examples
    public void getLeafNodes(TreeNode root, List<Integer> set) {
        // This code represents inorder traversal
        if (root == null)
            return;
