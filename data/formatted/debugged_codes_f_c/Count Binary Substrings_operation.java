Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

The provided code is intended to count the number of binary substrings in the given string. It uses a two-pointer approach to keep track of the current run length and the previous run length. 

The logical error in the code is the comparison `prevRunLength >= curRunLength` inside the loop. This comparison is incorrect because it counts substrings where the number of 0s is greater than or equal to the number of 1s, instead of counting substrings with alternating 0s and 1s. 

To fix the bug, the comparison should be replaced with `prevRunLength < curRunLength`, ensuring that only substrings with alternating 0s and 1s are counted. 

Additionally, the code can be optimized by initializing `prevRunLength` to 1 and starting the loop from index 1, as the initial run length is already considered in the initialization. 

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 13 ms (Top 82.14%) | Memory: 38.9 MB (Top 98.18%)
class Solution {
    public int countBinarySubstrings(String s) {
        int prevRunLength = 1, curRunLength = 1, count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                curRunLength++;
            } else {
                prevRunLength = curRunLength;
                curRunLength = 1;
            }
            if (prevRunLength < curRunLength) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
