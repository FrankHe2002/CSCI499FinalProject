Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: In the inner loop, variable `prevSum` is assigned `arr[j - 1]`, which tries to access the element at index `j - 1`. However, in the first iteration of the inner loop where `j` equals `i`, `arr[j - 1]` attempts to access `arr[-1]`, which is out of the array's bounds.

Fix: To fix this bug, we need to start the inner loop from `i` instead of `i + 1`, so that `prevSum` can be calculated correctly.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOddLengthSubarrays(int[] arr) {

        // Using two loops in this question...
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int prevSum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {
                prevSum += arr[j];
                if ((j - i + 1) % 2 == 1) {
                    sum += prevSum;
                }
            }
        }
        // Time Complexity : O(n-square)
        // Space Complexity : O(1)
        return sum;
    }
}
```
