Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, we can see that the variable `pivot` is used to mark the index of the first element that is not equal to `k` in the `nums` array. This is done to separate the array into two parts: one part before `pivot` contains elements less than `k` and the other part after `pivot` contains elements greater than `k`. However, the current code assumes that there will always be an element not equal to `k` in the `nums` array, which may not be the case. If there are no elements not equal to `k`, the `pivot` variable remains at its initial value of `-1`, causing the subsequent loop to iterate incorrectly and leading to incorrect results.

Fix: We can fix the issue by adding an additional check after the first loop to set `pivot` to `n` (the length of the `nums` array) if no elements not equal to `k` are found. This ensures that the subsequent loop executes correctly even in the absence of such elements.

Fixed Code:

class Solution {
    public int countSubarrays(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int n = nums.length;
        int less = 0, great = 0;
        int pivot = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++ i) {
            if (nums[i] != k) {
                pivot = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (pivot == -1) {
            pivot = n;
        }

        for (int i = pivot; i < n; ++ i) {
            if (nums[i] > k) great++;
            else if (nums[i] < k) less++;
            map.put(great - less, map.getOrDefault(great - less, 0) + 1);
        }

        int count = 0;
        less = great = 0;
        for (int i = pivot; i >= 0; -- i) {
            if (nums[i] > k) great++;
            else if (nums[i] < k) less++;
            int key = less - great;
            count += map.getOrDefault(key, 0) + map.getOrDefault(key + 1,
