Bug type: Logical error.

Reasoning process for identifying the bug:
1. The code aims to divide the array `arr` into three parts with equal sums.
2. The logic used to determine whether the division is possible is incorrect.
3. The code checks if the count of partitions is greater than 3 (`count > 3`), which is incorrect. It should be `count == 3` because we want exactly three partitions.
4. Additionally, the code should return `true` if the condition is satisfied, not `false` as the current implementation suggests.

Fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition `count > 3` to `count == 3`.
2. Change the return statement to `return count == 3`.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canThreePartsEqualSum(int[] arr) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int no : arr) {
            sum += no;
        }
        if (sum % 3 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        sum = sum / 3;
        int tempSum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            tempSum += arr[i];
            if (tempSum == sum) {
                count++;
                tempSum = 0;
            }
        }

        return count == 3;
    }
}
```
