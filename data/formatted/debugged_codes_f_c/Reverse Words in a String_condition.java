Bug Type: Logical error, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Reasoning: 

1. The conditional statement in the second for loop (`for (int i = 0; i >= n - 1; i++)`) has an incorrect condition. It should be `i <= n - 1` to iterate through the array indices.

2. The initial size of the `result` string is not calculated correctly. It should be `String result = arr[0] + " ";` since the first word is not included in the loop that reverses the array. 

3. The statement `result += arr[n - 1];` just adds the last word to the `result` string, but it doesn't add a space after it. Therefore, the last word will not be properly separated from the previous word.

4. The line `return result.trim();` is unnecessary since there are no leading or trailing spaces in the final result.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] arr = s.replaceAll("\\s{2,}", " ").split(" ");
        int n = arr.length;
        String temp = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[n - i - 1];
            arr[n - i - 1] = temp;
        }
        String result = arr[0] + " ";
        for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {
            result += arr[i] + " ";
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
