The bug in the provided code is a logical error in the return statement of the `helper` method. The current implementation divides the result of the left subtree by the result of the right subtree, which is incorrect for calculating the number of pseudo-palindromic paths.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the division operator (`/`) and change it to a simple addition (`+`). This change will correctly calculate the number of pseudo-palindromic paths by summing the results from both subtrees.

Additionally, the `TreeNode` class is missing from the code snippet, so it needs to be defined for the code to compile correctly. Let's assume the `TreeNode` class has the following structure:

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}
```

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int pseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode root) {
        return helper(root, 0);
    }

    public int helper(TreeNode node, int freq) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        freq = freq ^ (1 << node.val);
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return (freq & (freq - 1)) == 0 ? 1 : 0;
            // return Integer.bitCount(freq) <= 1 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        return helper(node.left, freq) + helper(node.right, freq);
    }
}
```
