The bug in the provided code is in the case where `a + b <= c`. The original code returns `a + b`, which is incorrect. The correct solution in this case is to return `(a + b) / 2`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        // Make sure a <= b <= c
        if (a > b) return maximumScore(b, a, c);
        if (b > c) return maximumScore(a, c, b);

        // if sum of smallest numbers [a+b] is less than c, then we can a + b pairs with the c
        if (a + b <= c) return (a + b) / 2;

        // if sum of smallest numbers is greater than c, then we can a+b)/2 pairs after making c empty
        return c + (a + b - c) / 2;
    }
}
```
