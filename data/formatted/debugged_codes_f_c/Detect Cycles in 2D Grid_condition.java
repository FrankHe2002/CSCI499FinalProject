Bug type: Logical/Algorithmic Error

Reasoning:
- The provided code attempts to find a cycle in a 2D grid using a depth-first search (DFS) approach.
- The bug appears in the direction checks (south, north, east, west) within the DFS method.
- The conditions for checking the directions are incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Fix:
- Adjust the conditions for checking the directions in the DFS method.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsCycle(char[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;

        // Create a boolean array of same dimensions to keep track of visited cells
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (!visited[i][j] && dfs(grid, visited, i, j, i, j, grid[i][j])) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public boolean dfs(
            char[][] grid,
            boolean[][] visited,
            int i,
            int j,
            int prevI,
            int prevJ,
            char c
    ) {
        // Check for out of bounds
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length) return false;

        // Check whether the current char matches the previous char
        if (grid[i][j] != c) return false;

        // If we stumble upon the same cell, we're guaranteed to have found a cycle!
        if (visited[i][j]) {
            return true;
        }

        // Mark the cell as visited
        visited[i][j] = true;

        // We want to search in the south direction ONLY IF we didn't come from north
        // Do the same for all four directions
        boolean south = i - prevI != 1;
        boolean north = i - prevI != -1;
        boolean east = j - prevJ != -1;
        boolean west = j - prevJ != 1;
        return
                (south && dfs(grid, visited, i + 1, j, i, j, c)) ||
                        (north && dfs(grid, visited, i - 1, j, i, j, c)) ||
                        (east && dfs
