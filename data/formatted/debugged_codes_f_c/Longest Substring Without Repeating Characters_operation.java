Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes a HashMap `hash` to store characters and their indices.
2. It uses a variable `count` to keep track of the length of the current substring without repeating characters.
3. It uses a variable `ans` to store the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
4. It iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
5. If the current character is already present in `hash`, it resets the iteration variable `i` to the index of the repeated character + 1, clears the hash map, and resets `count` to 0.
6. If the current character is not present in `hash`, it adds the character to the hash map along with its index, increments `count`, and updates `ans` if necessary.
7. It returns `ans` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

The logical error in the code is that it resets the iteration variable `i` and clears the hash map prematurely. This causes the code to miss checking for longer substrings that may exist after encountering a repeated character.

Fix:
To fix this, we need to update the code so that it only resets `count` and clears the hash map without modifying the iteration variable `i`. This way, it will continue iterating through the remaining characters of the string.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> hash = new HashMap<>();
        int count = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (hash.containsKey(s.charAt(i))) {
                int repeatedIndex = hash.get(s.charAt(i));
                count = i - repeatedIndex;
                hash.entrySet().removeIf(entry -> entry.getValue() <= repeatedIndex);
            } else {
                count++;
            }
            hash.put(s.charAt(i), i);
            ans = Math.max(ans, count);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
Fixed Explanation:
1. Added import statements for the `HashMap` and `Map` classes.
2. Changed the implementation code within the for loop to fix the logical error.
3. Introduced a new variable `repeatedIndex` to store the index of the repeated character in the hash map.
4. Updated the line `i = hash.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1;` to
