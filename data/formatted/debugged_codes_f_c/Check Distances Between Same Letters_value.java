Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:
1. The code uses a map to store the characters and their first occurrence indices.
2. For each character in the string, it checks if the character exists in the map.
3. If the character exists, it calculates the difference between the current index and the first occurrence index stored in the map.
4. If the calculated difference is not equal to the value in the `distance` array at the corresponding index, it returns false.
5. If the character does not exist in the map, it adds it to the map.
6. Finally, if the loop completes without returning false, it returns true.

Bugs:
1. The bug is in the line `if (distance[arr[i] - 'a'] != diff) return false;`.
2. The code assumes that the characters in the string are lowercase letters.
3. However, it does not check the validity of the characters before accessing the `distance` array.
4. If a character is not a lowercase letter, the code will result in an exception.
5. Also, the code does not account for the case when a character has multiple occurrences.

Fix:
1. Add a check to ensure that the character is a lowercase letter before accessing the `distance` array.
2. Modify the logic to check for multiple occurrences of a character using a separate variable.
3. Update the code to handle upper and lowercase letters for better flexibility.

                if (map.containsKey(c)) {
                    int start = map.get(c);
                    int diff = i - start - 1;
                    if (distance[c - 'a'] != diff) {
