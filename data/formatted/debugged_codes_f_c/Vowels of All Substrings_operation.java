Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The bug in the provided code lies in the calculation of the `count` variable inside the loop. The intention is to increment the count by multiplying the current count with the number of remaining characters in the string multiplied by the position of the current character. However, the code mistakenly multiplies the count instead of adding to it. 

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the `*=` operator to `+=` in order to increment the count correctly.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 23 ms (Top 33.08%) | Memory: 50 MB (Top 44.62%)
class Solution {

    boolean isVowel(char ch) {
        return ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'u';
    }

    public long countVowels(String word) {
        long count = 0;
        int len = word.length();

        for (int pos = 0; pos < len; pos++) {
            if (isVowel(word.charAt(pos))) {
                count += (long) (len - pos) * (long) (pos + 1);
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
