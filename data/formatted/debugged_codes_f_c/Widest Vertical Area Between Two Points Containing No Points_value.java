Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 

The provided code aims to find the maximum width of a vertical area given a 2D array of points representing coordinates. The code extracts the x-coordinates of the points, sorts them, and then calculates the maximum difference between adjacent x-coordinates to find the maximum width.

However, there is a logic error in the code. The `diff` variable is initialized with `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized with `0` because the minimum difference between coordinates would be `0`, not `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. This can cause incorrect results and may lead to unexpected behavior.

Fix:

Initialize the `diff` variable with `0` instead of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        int L = points.length;
        int arr[] = new int[L];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < L; i++) {
            arr[i] = points[i][0];
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr);

        int diff = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < L; i++) {
            if ((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) > diff) {
                diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return diff;
    }
}
```
