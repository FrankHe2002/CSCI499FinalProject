Bug Type: Incorrect Loop Limits

Reasoning: In the provided code, the loop running from `k = n - 1` to `k >= 2` is incorrect. The intention appears to be to loop through the array from the last element to the third element. However, the condition `k >= 2` includes the second element in the loop, which is incorrect according to the intention.

The fix is to change the loop condition to `k > 1`, ensuring that the loop iterates only until the third element, as intended.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int triangleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int count = 0;
        for (int k = n - 1; k > 1; k--) {
            int i = 0;
            int j = k - 1;
            while (i < j) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[j];
                if (sum > nums[k]) {
                    count += j - i;
                    j--;
                } else {
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
