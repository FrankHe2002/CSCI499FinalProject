Bug Type: Missing semicolon

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the bug is a missing semicolon at line 38, where `result += c` is not terminated properly. This leads to a syntax error.

Fix: Add a semicolon at the end of `result += c` to properly terminate the statement.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String repeatChar(char c, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++)
            result += c;
        return result;
    }
}
```
