Bug Type: Logical Error, Syntax Error

Reasoning:

1. The code attempts to allocate a specific amount of memory and assign a memory ID to it. However, there are multiple bugs in the code.

2. In the `allocate` method, there is a logical error in the loop condition. The condition `i < memory.length` is incorrect because it should consider the required size of memory as well. The loop should iterate until `i < memory.length - size + 1` to avoid going out of bounds.

3. Inside the nested loop, there is a syntax error in the condition of the loop. The condition `ii >= i * size + 1` is incorrect. It should be `ii >= i - size + 1` to correctly assign the memory IDs.

4. In the `free` method, there is no need to iterate through the entire memory array. The loop can be optimized to iterate until `i < memory.length - 1`, since the last element does not need to be checked.

Fix:

```java
// Runtime: 23 ms (Top 74.3%) | Memory: 44.52 MB (Top 41.8%)

class Allocator {
    private int[] memory;

    public Allocator(int n) {
        memory = new int[n];
    }

    public int allocate(int size, int mID) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < memory.length - size + 1; ++i) {
            if (memory[i] == 0) {
                if (++cnt == size) {
                    for (int ii = i; ii >= i - size + 1; --ii)
                        memory[ii] = mID;
                    return i - size + 1;
                }
            } else cnt = 0;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public int free(int mID) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < memory.length - 1; ++i)
            if (memory[i] == mID) {
                ++ans;
                memory[i] = 0;
            }
        return ans;
    }
}
