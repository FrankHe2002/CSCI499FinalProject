Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The code is trying to calculate the number of zero-filled subarrays in an array. However, the current implementation is incorrect. It only accounts for the number of continuous zeros in the array and not the actual zero-filled subarrays. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly calculate the number of zero-filled subarrays. One approach is to use a sliding window technique. We can maintain two pointers, `start` and `end`, and a variable `count` to keep track of the number of zero-filled subarrays. 

We iterate through the array using the `end` pointer. If the current element is a zero, we increment `count`. If the current element is not zero and `count` is greater than zero, we add `count * (count + 1) / 2` to the answer and reset `count` to zero. Finally, we return the answer.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public long zeroFilledSubarray(int[] nums) {
        long ans = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int end = 0; end < nums.length; end++) {
            if (nums[end] == 0) {
                count++;
            } else if (count > 0) {
                ans += (count * (count + 1)) / 2;
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        
        if (count > 0) {
            ans += (count * (count + 1)) / 2;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
