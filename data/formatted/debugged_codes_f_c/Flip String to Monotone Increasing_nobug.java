Bug Type: Variable Assignment

Reasoning: The bug in the provided code is in the assignment of the variable `zeroToOne`. It is currently assigned the minimum value between `zeroToOne + 1` and `countOfOnes`, but this logic is incorrect for the context of the problem. The correct assignment should be the minimum value between `zeroToOne` and `countOfOnes + 1`.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlipsMonoIncr(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int zeroToOne = 0;
        int countOfOnes = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '0')
                zeroToOne = Math.min(zeroToOne, countOfOnes + 1);
            else
                countOfOnes = countOfOnes + 1;
        }
        return zeroToOne;
    }
}
```
