Bug Type: Array Index Out Of Bounds

Reasoning:
- The code sorts the input array `cuts` and adds additional elements to the `arr` array (which acts as a modified version of `cuts` array).
- The `dp` array is initialized with dimensions `len + 1` because the `cuts` array has `len` elements.
- The nested loops in the code are used to calculate the minimum cost by recursively dividing the `cuts` array.
- However, there is an error in the nested loops where the line `dp[i][j - 1] = -1;` attempts to access index `j - 1`, which may go out of bounds.
- This error occurs because the inner loop starts from `j = 0`, which means that `j - 1` can be `-1`.
- The intention of the code seems to assign `-1` to `dp[i][j]` if it has not been calculated yet, but the incorrect index `j - 1` is used.
- This bug causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when executing the code.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the assignment statement inside the inner loop should be changed to `dp[i][j] = -1;` instead of `dp[i][j - 1] = -1;`.
This change ensures that the correct index `j` is used while assigning `-1` to `dp[i][j]`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int n, int[] cuts) {

        int len = cuts.length;

        Arrays.sort(cuts);

        int[] arr = new int[len + 2];
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++)
            arr[i] = cuts[i - 1];

        arr[0] = 0;
        arr[len + 1] = n;
        int[][] dp = new int[len + 1][len + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j <= len; j++)
                dp[i][j] = -1; // Fix: Correct index used here
        return cut(arr, 1, len, dp);
    }

    int cut(int[] cuts, int i, int j, int[][] dp) {
        if (i > j)
            return 0;

        if (dp[i][j] != -1)
            return
