Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: Upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that there is a logic error in the `move` method. The method is intended to calculate the minimum time required to harvest all the apples in a given graph. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where there are no apples in the graph. In the current code, if there are no apples present (`cont` is false) and the for loop goes through all the neighbors and doesn't find any unvisited nodes, the method returns -1. This implies that there is an apple that cannot be reached, which is incorrect. Instead, if there are no apples and all the neighbors have been visited, the method should return 0 to indicate that no time is required to harvest apples. Additionally, the variable `j` should be initialized to 0 rather than using its default value.

To fix this logic error, the following changes need to be made:
1. Initialize `j` to 0 before the for loop.
2. Update the condition in the return statement to check for both `j` and `cont` being 0 instead of just `j`.
3. Add a check after the for loop to return 0 if no apples and all neighbors have been visited.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minTime(int n, int[][] edges, List<Boolean> hasApple) {
        HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>(n);
        for (int edge[] : edges) {
            int a = edge[0], b = edge[1];
            graph.putIfAbsent(a, new LinkedList<>());
            graph.putIfAbsent(b, new LinkedList<>());
            graph.get(a).add(b);
            graph.get(b).add(a);
        }

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        Arrays.fill(visited, false);

        int a = move(0, graph, hasApple, n, visited);

        return a == -1 ? 0 : a;
    }

    public int move(int i, HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, List<Boolean> hasApple, int n, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[i] = true;
        boolean cont = false;
        if (hasApple.get(i)) {
            cont = true;
        }

        List<Integer> list = graph.get(i);
        if (list == null) {
            return cont ? 0 : -1;
        }
        int j = 0;
        for (int k
