Bug Type: Logic Error and Syntax Error

Explanation: 

1. Logic Error:
The logic of the code is incorrect. The loop condition `i > repeat + 2` causes the loop to start with `i` being 0 and the condition being evaluated as false. As a result, the loop is never entered and the code always returns `-1`, regardless of the inputs. The intention is likely to loop until `i` is greater than `repeat + 2`, so the loop condition should be `i <= repeat + 2`. Additionally, the loop should be modified to use the correct loop variable, `count`, instead of `i`, as the loop variable is intended to track the number of repetitions of `a`.

2. Syntax Error:
The code is missing a closing parenthesis (`)`) after the statement `result += c`. All statements in Java should end with a semicolon. Adding the missing closing parenthesis and semicolon will fix this syntax error.

Fix:

```java
// Runtime: 305 ms (Top 62.11%) | Memory: 113.5 MB (Top 30.98%)
class Solution {
    public int repeatedStringMatch(String a, String b) {
        String copyA = a;
        int count = 1;
        int repeat = b.length() / a.length();
        for (int count = 0; count <= repeat + 2; count++) {
            if (a.contains(b)) {
                return count;
            } else {
                a += copyA;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
