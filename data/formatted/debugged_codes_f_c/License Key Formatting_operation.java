Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The bug in the code lies in the condition `(length > 0 && length / k == 0)`. This condition checks if the length of the processed characters is greater than 0 and if the division of the length by `k` is equal to 0. However, the intention of this condition is to check if the length is not divisible evenly by `k`, indicating that a new group should be started and a hyphen should be appended. Therefore, the correct condition should be `(length > 0 && length % k == 0)`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 26 ms (Top 55.76%) | Memory: 45.6 MB (Top 53.19%)
class Solution {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder();
        int length = 0;
        // Iterate Backwards to fullfill first group condition
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '-') {
                continue;
            }
            if (length > 0 && length % k == 0) {
                answer.append('-');
            }
            answer.append(Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(i)));
            length++;
        }
        return answer.reverse().toString();
    }
}
