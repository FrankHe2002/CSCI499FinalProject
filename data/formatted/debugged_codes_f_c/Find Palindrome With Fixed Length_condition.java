Bug Type: Logic error

Reasoning:
1. The code appears to be a solution for finding the kth palindrome of a certain length.
2. The code correctly initializes an array `res` to store the results and loops through the `queries` array.
3. In the `nthPalindrome` method, the code calculates the `palindrome` value based on the given parameters.
4. The code then checks if `kdigit` is even or odd, and based on that, performs operations to create a palindrome number.
5. Finally, the code checks if the length of the palindrome number is equal to `kdigit` and returns the result accordingly.

The bug in this code is a logic error in the condition `if ((kdigit & 1) <= 0)`. This condition checks if `kdigit` is odd or even. However, the current implementation of this condition is incorrect. The `&` operator is a bitwise AND operator, which is not suitable for checking if a number is odd or even. The correct operator to use is the modulus operator `%`. Additionally, the condition is written incorrectly and can be simplified.

class Solution {
    public long[] kthPalindrome(int[] queries, int intLength) {
        long[] res = new long[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            res[i] = nthPalindrome(queries[i], intLength);
        }
        return res;
    }

    public long nthPalindrome(int nth, int kdigit) {
        long temp = (kdigit % 2 == 1) ? (kdigit / 2) : (kdigit / 2 - 1);
        long palindrome = (long) Math.pow(10, temp);
        palindrome += nth - 1;
        long res1 = palindrome;
        if (kdigit % 2 == 0)
            palindrome /= 10;
        while (palindrome > 0) {
            res1 = res1 * 10 + (palindrome % 10);
            palindrome /= 10;
        }
        String g = "";
        g += res1;
        if (g.length() != kdigit)
            return -1;
        return res1;
    }
}
