Bug type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning: In the `numDistinct` method, the array `dp` is initialized with dimensions `[n][m]`, where `n` is the length of string `s` and `m` is the length of string `t`. However, the recursive function `f` is called with indices `i - 1` and `j - 1` in the case where `s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)`. This can potentially result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `i == 0` or `j == 0`, as the indices will be negative.

Fix:
1. Change the dimensions of the `dp` array to `[n + 1][m + 1]`. This allows for accessing indices `i` and `j` up to `n` and `m` respectively, while keeping the original logic of the code intact.
2. Update the loop in the `numDistinct` method to initialize the `dp` array with `0` instead of `-1`.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    // We assume that dp[i][j] gives us the total number of distinct subsequences for the string s[0 to i] which equals string t[0 to j]
    int f(int i, int j, String s, String t, int dp[][]) {
        // If t gets exhausted then all the characters in t have been matched with s so we can return 1 (we found a subsequence)
        if (j < 0)
            return 1;
        // if s gets exhausted then there are characters remaining in t which are yet to be matched as s got exhausted they could not be matched so there is no distinct subsequence
        if (i < 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (dp[i][j] != -1)
            return dp[i][j];
        // If both the characters in s[i] and t[j] match then we have two cases
        // 1) Either consider the i'th character of s and find the remaining distinct subsequences of s[0 to i-1] which equals t[0 to j-1] set i.e. f(i-1,j-1)
        // 2) Do not consider s[i] so we are still at the same j'th character of t as we had not been considering s[i] matched with t[j] we check distinct
