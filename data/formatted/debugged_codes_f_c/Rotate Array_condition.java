Example Explanation:

The given code attempts to rotate an array `nums` to the right by `k` steps. It does this by reversing the whole array, then reversing the first `k` elements, and finally reversing the remaining elements. However, there is a bug in the code that causes it to not rotate the array correctly.

Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation: 
The bug in the code lies in the `while` condition of the `reverse` function. The condition `start >= end` is incorrect. It should be `start <= end` in order to ensure that the elements are swapped correctly and the array is reversed. 

Additionally, the `reverse` function should be made static, as it is being called from a static context in the `rotate` function.

To fix the bug, the `while` condition in the `reverse` function needs to be changed to `start <= end`, and the `reverse` function needs to be made static.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
    }

    public static void reverse(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        while (start <= end) {
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
