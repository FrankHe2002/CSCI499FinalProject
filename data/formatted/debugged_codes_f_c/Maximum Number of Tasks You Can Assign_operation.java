Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided code contains several bugs:
1. The method `isPossibleToComplete` is named incorrectly as `isPossible`.
2. The method call `isPossible(tasks, workers, pills, strength, mid)` inside the `maxTaskAssign` method is calling a non-existent method.
3. The `isPossibleToComplete` method uses the `isPossible` method to check if it's possible to complete the tasks. However, the logic of the `isPossibleToComplete` method contradicts the intended behavior. The conditional statements and checks within the method do not correctly determine if it's possible to complete the tasks and update the map of workers.

To fix the code, the following changes will be made:
1. Rename the method `isPossibleToComplete` to `isPossible`.
2. Change the method call `isPossible(tasks, workers, pills, strength, mid)` to `isPossibleToComplete(tasks, workers, pills, strength, mid)`.
3. Reconfigure the logic inside the `isPossible` method to correctly determine if it's possible to complete the tasks and update the map of workers.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.TreeMap;

class Solution {

    public int maxTaskAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks);
        Arrays.sort(workers);

        int st = 0;
        int end = Math.min(tasks.length, workers.length) - 1;
        int ans = 0;
        while (st <= end) {
            int mid = (st + end) / 2;
            if (isPossibleToComplete(tasks, workers, pills, strength, mid)) {
                st = mid + 1;
                ans = Math.max(ans, mid + 1);
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    boolean isPossibleToComplete(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength, int mid) {
        int n = workers.length;
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();

        for (int i = n - 1, count = 0; count <= mid && i >= 0; i--, count++) {
            map.merge(workers[i], 1, (a, b) -> a + b);
        }
        int done = n - 1;
        int count = mid;
        for (int i = mid;
