The provided buggy code is attempting to implement a solution for picking a random point from a set of rectangles based on their area. 

Bug #1:
```java
int[] rectangle = map.getkey);
```
The code mistakenly has a syntax error at this line. It is missing the closing parenthesis after `map.get` method. The fix is to add the missing closing parenthesis, making the line `int[] rectangle = map.get(key);`.

Bug #2:
```java
public int[] pick() {
    int key = map.ceilingKey(random.nextInt(areaSum) + 1); //Don't forget to +1 here, because we need [1,area] while nextInt generates [0,area-1]

    int[] rectangle = map.getkey);

    ...
}
```
There is another syntax error in this code section. The line `int[] rectangle = map.getkey);` is missing a dot (`.`) after `get` method. The fix is to add the missing dot, making the line `int[] rectangle = map.get(key);`.

Fixed Code:
```java

class Solution {

    Random random;
    TreeMap<Integer, int[]> map;
    int areaSum = 0;

    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        this.random = new Random();
        this.map = new TreeMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < rects.length; i++) {
            int[] rectangeCoordinates = rects[i];
            int length = rectangeCoordinates[2] - rectangeCoordinates[0] + 1; // +1 as we need to consider edges also.
            int breadth = rectangeCoordinates[3] - rectangeCoordinates[1] + 1;

            areaSum += length * breadth;

            map.put(areaSum, rectangeCoordinates);

        }

    }

    public int[] pick() {
        int key = map.ceilingKey(random.nextInt(areaSum) + 1); //Don't forget to +1 here, because we need [1,area] while nextInt generates [0,area-1]

        int[] rectangle = map.get(key);

        int length = rectangle[2] - rectangle[0] + 1; // +1 as we need to consider edges also.
        int breadth = rectangle[3] - rectangle[1] + 1;

        int x = rectangle[
