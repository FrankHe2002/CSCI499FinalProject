Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning: Upon examining the buggy code, it can be observed that the issue occurs at the line `for (int] dir : dirs)`. The `dirs` array is a 2D array representing directions, and each element in `dirs` is a 1D array representing a direction. However, there is a typo in the code where the closing square bracket (`]`) is misplaced. It should be `for (int[] dir : dirs)` instead of `for (int] dir : dirs)`. This typo causes a syntax error, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix: Change `for (int] dir : dirs)` to `for (int[] dir : dirs)`.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 84.7%) | Memory: 57.45 MB (Top 26.3%)

class Solution {
    int[][] dirs = new int[][] {{1, 0}, {- 1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, - 1}};

    public int[] hitBricks(int[][] grid, int[][] hits) {
        //marking all the hits that has a brick with -1
        for (int i = 0; i < hits.length; i++)
            if (grid[hits[i][0]][hits[i][1]] == 1)
                grid[hits[i][0]][hits[i][1]] = - 1;

        //marking all the stable bricks
        for (int i = 0; i < grid[0].length; i++)
            markAndCountStableBricks(grid, 0, i);

        int[] res = new int[hits.length];
        //looping over hits array backwards and restoring bricks
        for (int i = hits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int row = hits[i][0];
            int col = hits[i][1];

            //hit is at empty space so continue
            if (grid[row][col] == 0)
                continue;

            //marking it with 1, this signifies that a brick is present in an unstable state and will be restored in the future
            grid[row][col] = 1;
            // checking brick stability, if it's unstable no need to visit the neighbours
            if (! isStable(grid, row, col))
                continue;

            //So now as our brick
