Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. Initially, the code creates two sets: `set` and `res`, and sets the `index` variable to 0.
2. The `findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict` method loops through each word in the `words` array.
3. Within the loop, it retrieves the length of the current word and resets the `index` variable to 0.
4. Then, it calls the `backtrack` method passing the length of the word, the word itself, and the `num` variable initialized to 0.
5. The `backtrack` method checks if the `index` is equal to the length of the word and if `num` is greater than or equal to 2. If so, it adds the word to the `res` set.
6. It then creates a copy of the current `index` and enters a loop from `index + 1` to `len` (inclusive).
7. Inside the loop, it checks if the `set` contains the substring from the current `index` to `i`. If so, it updates the `index` and recursively calls the `backtrack` method with `num` incremented by 1.
8. After the loop, it returns to the previous `index` by assigning the value of `indexCopy` back to `index`.
9. Finally, the `list` is created, and all the words in the `res` set are added to the `list`. The list is then returned.

The bug in the code is in the loop condition of the `backtrack` method. The condition is `i <= len`, which is one index out of bounds. Since `len` is the length of the word, accessing index `len` will result in an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. To fix this bug, the loop condition should be changed to `i < len` to account for zero-based indexing.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
    Set<String> res = new HashSet<>();
    int index = 0;

    public List<String> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(String[] words) {
        for (String word : words) set.add(word);
        for (String word : words) {
            int len = word.length();
            index = 0;
            backtrack(len, word, 0);
        }
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String word : res
