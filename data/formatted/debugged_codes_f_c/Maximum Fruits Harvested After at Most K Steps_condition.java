Buggy Code Explanation:
The provided buggy code has multiple issues that need to be addressed. 

1. The loop condition in the first loop (`for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`) does not go up to `n` as intended. It should iterate until `i < n` to avoid array index out of bounds error.
2. The calculation of `end` value is incorrect. It should be `int end = Math.min(startPos + k, prefixArr.length);` to include the last element of `prefixArr`.
3. In the calculation of `minimum`, the assignment should be `int minimum = prefixArr[startPos - 1];` instead of `int minimum = prefixArr[startPos];`. This is because `startPos` is already excluded from the loop and the minimum value should be before `startPos`.
4. In the first loop after the prefix array is filled (`for (int i = startPos - 1; i >= start; i--)`), the assignment of `curr` should be `curr = prefixArr[i];` instead of `curr += prefixArr[i];` to correctly assign the accumulated sum.
5. In the second loop after the prefix array is filled (`for (int i = startPos + 1; i <= end; i++)`), the assignment of `curr` should also be `curr = prefixArr[i];` instead of `curr += prefixArr[i];` for the same reason mentioned above.
6. In the first loop (`for (int i = start; i < startPos; i++)`), the condition `endIndex >= prefixArr.length` should be changed to `endIndex > prefixArr.length - 1` to avoid index out of bounds error.
7. In the second loop (`for (int i = startPos + 1; i <= end; i++)`), the condition `endIndex < 0` should be changed to `endIndex < 0` to avoid index out of bounds error.

Additionally, the variable names could be improved for clarity and consistency.

Buggy Code Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTotalFruits(int[][] fruits, int startPos, int k) {
        int n = fruits.length;
        int posOfLastFruit = fruits[n - 1][0];
        int prefixSumArr[] = new int[posOfLastFruit + 1];
        int start = Math.max(startPos - k, 0);
        int
