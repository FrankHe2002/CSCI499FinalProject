Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

In this code, the logical error is found in the line `if (1 << i == allVisited) return 0;`. 

The intention of this line is to check if the current node `i` is the destination node (i.e., all nodes have been visited). However, the condition `(1 << i == allVisited)` is incorrect.

The expression `1 << i` returns a number where all bits are zero except for the bit at position `i`. For example, if `i` is 2, `1 << i` will be `0b00000100`. Therefore, this condition will always be false unless `allVisited` is equal to `1 << i`, which is highly unlikely.

The correct condition to check if all nodes have been visited is `p.path == allVisited`.

Fix:

To fix this logical error, the line `if (1 << i == allVisited) return 0;` should be changed to `if (p.path == allVisited) return step;`, as explained above. Additionally, the return statement should use `step` instead of `step + 1` to properly represent the number of steps taken.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 17 ms (Top 78.04%) | Memory: 46.7 MB (Top 69.44%)
class Solution {
    class Pair {
        int i;
        int path;

        public Pair(int i, int path) {
            this.i = i;
            this.path = path;
        }
    }

    public int shortestPathLength(int[][] graph) {
        /*
        For each node currentNode, steps as key, visited as value
        boolean[currentNode][steps]
        */
        int n = graph.length;

        // 111....1, 1<< n - 2
        int allVisited = (1 << n) - 1;

        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][1 << n];
        Queue<Pair> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((1 << i) == allVisited) return 0;
            visited[i][1 << i] = true;
            q.offer(new Pair(i, 1 << i));
        }
        int step = 0;
        while (! q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
