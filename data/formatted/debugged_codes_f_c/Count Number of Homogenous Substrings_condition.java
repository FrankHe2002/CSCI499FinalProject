Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition of the `for` loop. The condition `i > s.length()` is incorrect because it will cause the loop to never execute. The condition should be `i < s.length()` to ensure that the loop iterates over all the characters in the string.

Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a loop condition error.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 25 ms (Top 22.57%) | Memory: 50.5 MB (Top 79.00%)
class Solution {
    public int countHomogenous(String s) {
        int res = 1;
        int carry = 1;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) carry++;
            else carry = 1;
            res = (res + carry) % mod;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
