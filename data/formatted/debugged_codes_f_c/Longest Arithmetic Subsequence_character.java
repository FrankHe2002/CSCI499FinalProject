Bug Type: Syntax Error, Typo

Reasoning: In the provided code, there is a syntax error in the declaration of the `dp` Map. The closing square bracket (`]`) is misplaced after `Map<Integer, Integer>` instead of after the variable name `dp`. This results in a syntax error. Additionally, there is a typo in the method name `longestArithSeqLength` where the letter "t" is missing.

Fix: The fix involves moving the closing square bracket (`]`) to the correct position after the variable name `dp` and adding the missing letter "t" to the method name `longestArithSeqLength`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 440 ms (Top 73.2%) | Memory: 70.79 MB (Top 29.5%)

class Solution {
    public int longestArithSeqLength(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int longest = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer>[] dp = new HashMap[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = new HashMap<>();

            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int diff = nums[i] - nums[j];
                dp[i].put(diff, dp[j].getOrDefault(diff, 1) + 1);
                longest = Math.max(longest, dp[i].get(diff));
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
}
