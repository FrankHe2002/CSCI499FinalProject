Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Logical Error

Reasoning: 
1. The loop condition in the `shuffle()` method, `i <= a.length`, should be `i < a.length` to prevent accessing an index out of the array's bounds.
2. Even if the loop condition is corrected, there is a logical error in the code. Swapping elements randomly from the entire array (including the elements already swapped) may lead to incorrect shuffling. It is necessary to limit the range of the index to swap with, ensuring that each element has an equal probability of being selected.

Fix:
1. Change the loop condition in the `shuffle()` method from `i <= a.length` to `i < a.length`.
2. Generate a random index within the range of remaining elements to swap with, rather than the entire array. Swap the randomly selected index with the current index `i`.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {

    int a[];
    int b[];

    public Solution(int[] nums) {
        a = nums.clone();
        b = nums.clone();
    }

    public int[] reset() {
        a = b.clone();
        return a;
    }

    public int[] shuffle() {

        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            int randIndex = i + (int) (Math.random() * (a.length - i));
            int temp = a[randIndex];
            a[randIndex] = a[i];
            a[i] = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
