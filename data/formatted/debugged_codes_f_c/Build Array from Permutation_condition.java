Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 
In the provided code, there are two logical errors in the `buildArray` method.

1. In the first for loop, the expression `nums[i] + n * (nums[nums[i]] % n)` is used to update the elements of the `nums` array. However, the expression `nums[nums[i]] % n` is incorrect. It should be `nums[i] % n` to correctly calculate the new value for `nums[i]`.
2. In the second for loop, the condition `i <= n` is incorrect. It should be `i < n` to ensure that only the elements within the array's valid range are divided by `n` to restore their original values.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] buildArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = nums[i] + n * (nums[i] % n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nums[i] = nums[i] / n;

        return nums;
    }
}
```
