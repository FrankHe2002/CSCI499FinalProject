Bug Type: Logical Error, Syntax Error

Bug #1: Logical Error
- In the code block for odd palindromes (center of 1 index), there is a calculation mistake in the condition for checking the length of the palindrome (`if (right - left + 1 >= k)`). It should be `if (right - left + 1 > k)`. The current condition includes palindromes with length equal to `k`, which is incorrect.

Bug #2: Syntax Error
- There is a missing semicolon (`;`) at the end of the line `dp[i + 1] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i + 1])`.

Reasoning for identifying and fixing the bugs:
- Bug #1: The bug is identified by examining the condition for calculating the length of the palindrome. Since the code is already calculating palindromes with odd and even lengths separately, it's important to ensure that only palindromes longer than `k` are considered. Fixing the condition to `if (right - left + 1 > k)` resolves this logic error.
- Bug #2: The bug is identified by observing the syntax error in the line `dp[i + 1] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i + 1])`. The missing semicolon at the end of the line causes a compilation error. Fixing it by adding the missing semicolon corrects the syntax error.

Fixed Code:

class Solution {
    public int maxPalindromes(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];

        // Base case (redundant, but for clarity)
        dp[0] = 0;

        // Odd palindrome (center of 1 index)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i + 1] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i + 1]);
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int left = i - j;
                int right = i + j;
                if (left < 0 || right >= n) break;
                if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) break;

                if (right - left + 1 > k) {
                    dp[right +
