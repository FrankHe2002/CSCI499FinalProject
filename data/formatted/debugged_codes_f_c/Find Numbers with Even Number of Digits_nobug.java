Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The buggy code has a logical error in the condition `(val > 9 && val < 100) || (val > 999 && val < 10000) || val == 100000)`. This condition incorrectly checks for numbers that have exactly two digits, or numbers that have exactly four digits, or the number 100000. However, the task is to count the number of even-digit numbers. The condition should check for numbers with an even number of digits.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            if (String.valueOf(val).length() % 2 == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
