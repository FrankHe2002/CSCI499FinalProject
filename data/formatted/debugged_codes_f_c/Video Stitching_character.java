Buggy Code Explanation:

The provided code is a method called `videoStitching` that attempts to calculate the minimum number of clips needed to cover a given time span. However, the code contains multiple bugs:

1. Syntax Error: The line `if clips[j][0] < i)` is missing parentheses around the condition.
2. Index Out of Bounds Error: The array `interval` is not properly initialized, causing an index out of bounds error when assigning values to its elements.
3. Incorrect Loop Termination Condition: The loop `while (true)` has no proper termination condition, causing an infinite loop in certain scenarios.
4. Incorrect Updating of `can_reach` Variable: The `can_reach` variable is not properly updated within the loop. It needs to be set to `0` before iterating over the clips to find the maximum reachable point.
5. Incorrect Updating of `interval` Array: The `interval` array is not updated correctly after finding the maximum reachable point. The two elements of the array need to be updated accordingly.
6. Incorrect Return Value: The code does not return a meaningful value in all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect behavior.

Fixing these bugs will result in the corrected code.

Bug Fixes:
1. Fix the syntax error by adding parentheses around the condition in the line `if clips[j][0] < i)`.
2. Initialize the `interval` array with the values `0` and `0` before the start of the loop.
3. Add a termination condition for the `while (true)` loop by breaking out of the loop when the interval cannot be extended further.
4. Set `can_reach` to `0` before starting the inner loop that searches for the maximum reachable point.
5. Update the `interval` array correctly after finding the maximum reachable point.
6. Add return statements at the end of the method, including a return statement with `-1` if the interval cannot cover the entire time.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int videoStitching(int[][] clips, int time) {
        Arrays.sort(clips, (x, y) -> x[0] == y[0] ? y[1] - x[1] : x[0] - y[0]);
        int n = clips.length;
        int interval[] = {0, 0}; // Initialize the interval array
        int cuts = 0;
        while (true) {
            cuts++;
