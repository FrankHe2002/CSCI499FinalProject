Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
The provided code sorts an array such that all even numbers appear before odd numbers. However, the implementation of the sorting logic is incorrect. The bug is in the condition `nums[i] * 2 == 1`, which incorrectly checks if a number is odd. Multiplying a number by 2 and comparing it to 1 is not a valid method for checking oddness.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `nums[i] % 2 != 0`, which checks if a number is odd by using the modulus operator `%` to check for a remainder when dividing by 2.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 48.1 MB (Top 66.96%)
class Solution {

    public int[] sortArrayByParity(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while (i < nums.length) {
            if (nums[i] % 2 != 0) {
                i++;
            } else {
                int temp = nums[i];
                nums[i] = nums[j];
                nums[j] = temp;

                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }

        return nums;
    }
}
```
