Bug Type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning: The bug type in the provided code is an off-by-one error. 

To identify the bug, we need to analyze the loop conditions. The outer loop iterates from 0 to `points.length - 2`, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to `points[i].length - 2`. However, the inner loop should iterate over all elements of `points[i]` instead of `points[i].length - 2`.

The fix for this bug is to change the inner loop condition from `j < points[i].length - 1` to `j < points[i].length`. This ensures that the inner loop iterates over all elements of `points[i]`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 57.50*) | Memory 43.4 MB (Top 57.64%)
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(int[][] points) {
        int max = 0, x, y;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < points[i].length; j++) {
                x = Math.abs(points[i][j] - points[i + 1][j]);
                y = Math.abs(points[i][j + 1] - points[i + 1][j + 1]);
                max += Math.max(x, y);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
