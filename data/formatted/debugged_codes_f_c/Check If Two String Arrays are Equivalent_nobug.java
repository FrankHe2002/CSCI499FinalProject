Buggy Code Explanation:
The `arrayStringsAreEqual` method checks if two arrays of strings represent equal strings when concatenated. The buggy code attempts to achieve this by using the `String.join` method to concatenate the arrays of strings into a single string, and then comparing these concatenated strings. However, there is a potential bug in the code.

The bug in the code is that it assumes the concatenation of the strings in `word1` and `word2` will always result in the same order of characters, which may not be the case. The `String.join` method concatenates the strings in the provided array using the delimiter as a separator, but it does not guarantee the order of the concatenated strings.

To fix this bug, we should iterate through the arrays and compare each individual string to ensure they are equal. Additionally, there is another issue with the code: it does not handle null arrays properly. If one of the arrays is null, the code will throw a `NullPointerException`. We should add a check for null arrays and return false if either `word1` or `word2` is null.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean arrayStringsAreEqual(String[] word1, String[] word2) {
        if (word1 == null || word2 == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder();
        for (String s: word1) {
            sb1.append(s);
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder();
        for (String s: word2) {
            sb2.append(s);
        }
        
        return sb1.toString().equals(sb2.toString());
    }
}
```
