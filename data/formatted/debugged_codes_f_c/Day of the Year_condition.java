The bug in the provided code is in the loop condition of the for loop. 

Reasoning:
1. The loop starts from `i = 0` and continues as long as `i` is greater than the calculated index: `((date.charAt(5) - 48) * 10) + date.charAt(6) - 48 - 1`.
2. The intention of the loop is likely to iterate through the months of the year.
3. However, the condition `(i > ((date.charAt(5) - 48) * 10) + date.charAt(6) - 48 - 1)` is incorrect. It will not execute the loop if `i` is greater than the calculated index, which is inconsistent with the intention of the loop.
4. To fix this, the condition should be changed to `i < ((date.charAt(5) - 48) * 10) + date.charAt(6) - 48 - 1`, ensuring that the loop iterates for all valid months.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int dayOfYear(String date) {
        int[] months = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        int year = (date.charAt(0) - 48) * 1000 + (date.charAt(1) - 48) * 100 + (date.charAt(2) - 48) * 10 + date.charAt(3) - 48;
        if (year % 4 == 0 && year != 1900) {
            months[1]++;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ((date.charAt(5) - 48) * 10) + date.charAt(6) - 48 - 1; i++) {
            ans += months[i];
        }
        ans += (date.charAt(8) - 48) * 10 + date.charAt(9) - 48;
        return ans;
    }
}
```
