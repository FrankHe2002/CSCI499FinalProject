Bug Type: Logical Error

Explanation: The buggy code has a logical error. It computes the result by adding `t * 2` to `num`. However, the question asks for the maximum achievable value of `x` in the equation `x + y = num`, where `x` and `y` are nonnegative integers and `t` is the total number of operations allowed. In each operation, we can increment `x` or `y` by 1.

To compute the maximum achievable value of `x`, we need to allocate as many operations as possible to increment `x`. We can allocate `t` operations to increment `x` by 1 `t` times. After that, we can allocate the remaining operations to increment `y` by 1. Therefore, the maximum achievable value of `x` is `num - t`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 100.0%) | Memory: 40.61 MB (Top 17.0%)

class Solution {
    public int theMaximumAchievableX(int num, int t) {
        return num - t;
    }
}
```
