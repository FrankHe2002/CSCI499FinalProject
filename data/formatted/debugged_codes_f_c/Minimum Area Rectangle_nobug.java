Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code aims to find the minimum area rectangle formed by a set of points.
2. The bug lies in the condition `(! map.containsKey(point[0]))` which checks if the map already contains the x-coordinate of the point.
3. If the map doesn't contain the x-coordinate, a new HashSet is created and added to the map with the x-coordinate as the key and the corresponding y-coordinate as the value.
4. However, this condition is incorrect because the map should contain the x-coordinate in order to add a new y-coordinate to the set.
5. To fix this bug, the condition should be changed to `(map.containsKey(point[0]))` which checks if the map already contains the x-coordinate.
6. This change ensures that only if the x-coordinate is already in the map, a new y-coordinate is added to the set.

Fixed Code:
```java

class Solution {

    public int minAreaRect(int[][] points) {

        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Group the points by x coordinates
        for (int[] point : points) {
            if (map.containsKey(point[0])) map.get(point[0]).add(point[1]);
            else {
                map.put(point[0], new HashSet<>());
                map.get(point[0]).add(point[1]);
            }
        }

        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {

            int x1 = points[i][0];
            int y1 = points[i][1];
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
                int x2 = points[j][0];
                int y2 = points[j][1];
                if (x1 == x2 || y1 == y2) // We are looking for diagonal point, so if j is neighbour point, then continue
                    continue;

                // Note - We are calculating area first (before checking whether these points form the correct rectangle), because
                // cost of checking rectangle is very higher than calculating area. So if area less than the prev area (min), then only 
                // it makes sense to check rectangle and override min (if these points forms the correct rectangle)
                int area = Math.abs(x1 - x2) * Math.abs(y1 -
