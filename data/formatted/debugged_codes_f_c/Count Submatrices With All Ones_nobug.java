Bug Type: Logical Error

Bug Explanation: The logical error in the given code is in the calculation of `minHeight` in the innermost loop. The loop computes the minimum height of consecutive ones that can form submatrices with the current position as the lower right corner. However, the calculation of `minHeight` should be based on `left[i][j-k]` and not `up[i-k][j]`.

Fix: To fix this bug, the calculation of `minHeight` in the innermost loop should be changed to `minHeight = Math.min(minHeight, left[i][j - k])` instead of `minHeight = Math.min(minHeight, up[i - k][j])`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubmat(int[][] mat) {
        int n = mat.length;
        int m = mat[0].length;
        //left[i][j] indicates how many consecutive 1s are on the left of i, j
        //left[i][j] indicates how many consecutive 1s are above i, j
        //dp[i][j] represents the number of submatrices with i, j as the lower right corner
        int[][] left = new int[n][m];
        int[][] up = new int[n][m];
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        up[0][0] = mat[0][0];
        left[0][0] = mat[0][0];
        dp[0][0] = mat[0][0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (mat[i][0] == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            up[i][0] = mat[i][0];
            left[i][0] = left[i - 1][0] + 1;
            dp[i][0] = left[i][0];
        }

        for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            if (mat[0][j] == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            up[0][j] = up[0][j - 1] + 1;
            left[0][j] = mat[0][j];
            dp[0][j] = up[0][j];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j =
