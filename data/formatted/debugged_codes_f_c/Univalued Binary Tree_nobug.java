Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: The provided code is for a method that checks whether a binary tree is univalued, meaning all of its nodes have the same value. However, the code has a logical error in the traversal algorithm. 

In the current implementation, the `traversal()` method recursively checks if the values of the nodes are equal to the `firstVal` variable. If a mismatch is found, the `ans` variable is set to `false`, indicating that the tree is not univalued. The problem is that the `firstVal` variable is only initialized with the value of the root node (`firstVal = root.val`) and does not get updated when traversing the rest of the tree. This means that the method will only correctly determine if the tree is univalued if the root node has the same value as all other nodes.

To fix this logical error, the `firstVal` variable must be updated during the traversal process. Each time a new node is visited, its value should be compared with the `firstVal` variable, and if they are different, the `ans` variable should be set to `false`.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    boolean ans = true;

    public boolean isUnivalTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return ans;
        traversal(root, root.val);
        return ans;
    }

    private void traversal(TreeNode root, int firstVal) {
        if (root == null)
            return;
        if (root.val != firstVal)
            ans = false;
        traversal(root.left, firstVal);
        traversal(root.right, firstVal);
    }
}
```
