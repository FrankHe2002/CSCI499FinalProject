Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 
The provided code is trying to find the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by picking every third element from the sorted array `piles`. However, the current implementation has a logical error in the loop condition, specifically in `i < n`. The condition should be `i < n / 3` because the loop variable `i` starts from `n / 3`, and we want to iterate until the end of the array. 

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[] piles) {
        Arrays.sort(piles);
        int s = 0, n = piles.length;
        for (int i = n / 3; i < n; i += 2)
            s += piles[i];
        return s;
    }
}
```
