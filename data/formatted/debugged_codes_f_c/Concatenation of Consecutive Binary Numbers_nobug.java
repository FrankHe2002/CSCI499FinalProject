Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the provided code lies in the line `res = (res * (int) Math.pow(2, Integer.toBinaryString(i).length()) + i) % 1000000007;`. It attempts to calculate the binary representation of `i`, obtain its length, raise 2 to that length, multiply it with `res`, add `i`, and take the modulus of the result with `1000000007`. However, the `Math.pow()` method returns a `double` value, and casting it to an `int` truncates the decimal places, leading to incorrect calculations.

Bug Type:
The bug in the code is a logical error due to incorrect calculations.

Fix and Updated Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 38.2 MB (Top 25.71%)
class Solution {
    public int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
        final int MOD = 1000000007;
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int length = Integer.toBinaryString(i).length();
            res = ((res << length) % MOD + i) % MOD;
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```

Fix Explanation:
To fix the bug, we need to make the following changes:
1. Define a constant `MOD` to hold the value `1000000007`, which is used for taking the modulus.
2. Change the type of `res` to `long`.
3. Calculate the length of the binary representation of `i` and store it in a separate variable, `length`.
4. Shift `res` to the left by `length` bits using the `<<` operator to multiply `res` by `2^length`. Take the modulus of this result with `MOD`.
5. Add `i` to the modified `res` and take the modulus of the result with `MOD`.
6. Return the final value of `res` casted to an `int`.
