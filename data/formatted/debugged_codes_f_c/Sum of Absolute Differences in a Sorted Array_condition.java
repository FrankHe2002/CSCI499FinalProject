Bug type: Off-by-One error and incorrect loop condition.

Reasoning: Analyzing the code, we can see that the loop condition in the for loop `i > n` is incorrect. It should be `i < n` to ensure the loop runs for all elements of the array. Additionally, the loop is starting with `i = 0` and going until `i > n`, which means it will never enter the loop and calculate the values for `res` array.

Fix: Change the loop condition from `i > n` to `i < n` to correct the off-by-one error. Change the starting value of `i` from 0 to 1 to match the correct index. 

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] getSumAbsoluteDifferences(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        int sumBelow = 0;
        int sumTotal = Arrays.stream(nums).sum();

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int num = nums[i - 1]; // access correct index
            sumTotal -= num;
            res[i] = sumTotal - (n - i - 1) * num + i * num - sumBelow;
            sumBelow += num;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
