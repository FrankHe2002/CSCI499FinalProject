The bug type in the provided buggy code is a logical error.

Reasoning process:
The provided code attempts to calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach the target value starting from the given start value. It follows a specific set of rules:
- If the start value is greater than or equal to the target value, the difference between them is returned.
- If the target value is even, the function is recursively called with the start value and target divided by 2.
- If the target value is odd, the function is recursively called with the start value and target incremented by 1.

However, this logic is flawed. Consider the case where the start value is 3 and the target value is 7. According to the provided code, the function calls:
- brokenCalc(3, 7) -> returns 1 + brokenCalc(3, 8)
- brokenCalc(3, 8) -> returns 1 + brokenCalc(3, 9)
- brokenCalc(3, 9) -> returns 1 + brokenCalc(3, 10)
- ... goes on indefinitely, incorrectly increasing the target value.

To fix this logical error, we need to modify the recursive calls as follows:
- If the target value is even, we divide it by 2 and make the recursive call.
- If the target value is odd, we increment it by 1 and make the recursive call.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 0 ms (Top 100.00%) | Memory: 36.5 MB (Top 35.93%)
class Solution {
    public int brokenCalc(int startValue, int target) {
        if (startValue >= target) return startValue - target;
        if (target % 2 == 0) {
            return 1 + brokenCalc(startValue, target / 2);
        }
        return 1 + brokenCalc(startValue, target + 1);
    }
}
```
