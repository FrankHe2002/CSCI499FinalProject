Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: In the for loop condition `n = - (n >=> 1)`, the `>=>` operator is not a valid operator in Java. It seems to be a typographical error, likely intended to be the right-shift operator `>>`. The intended operation is to right-shift the value of `n` by 1.

Fix:
Replace `n >=> 1` with `n >> 1` in the for loop condition.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String baseNeg2(int n) {
        StringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder(n == 0 ? "0" : "");
        for (; n != 0; n = -(n >> 1)) {
            answer.append((n & 1) == 0 ? '0' : '1');
        }
        return answer.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
