The bug type in the provided buggy code is an off-by-one error. In the for loop condition, `i < g.length` should be used instead of `i < g.length`. The current condition allows the loop to continue iterating even when all the content children have been satisfied.

Original Buggy Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; i < g.length && j < s.length; j++) {
            if (g[i] >= s[j]) i++;
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; i < g.length && j < s.length; j++) {
            if (g[i] <= s[j]) i++;
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```

Explanation for fixing the bug:
We need to iterate through the given array of cookie sizes `s` and the array of children's greed factors `g` until we run out of either cookies or children. 
However, the original buggy code increments `i` (representing the index of content children) each time `g[i] >= s[j]`, which incorrectly increments `i` even when a child cannot be satisfied by the current cookie size. 
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `g[i] <= s[j]`, ensuring that `i` only increments if the current child can be satisfied by the current cookie size.
