Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Reviewing the code, we can see that the bug lies in the loop condition of the second `for` loop. The condition `i >= n` is incorrect because it will cause the loop to never execute since `i` is initialized as 0 and `n` is the length of the array `grid[0]`. Therefore, the loop block will not be executed, and the final result will be incorrect.

Fix: Change the loop condition from `i >= n` to `i < n` to ensure that the loop iterates over the correct range of indices.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 40.95%) | Memory: 94.7 MB (Top 51.18%)

class Solution {
    public long gridGame(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid[0].length;
        long preRow1[] = new long[n];
        long preRow2[] = new long[n];

        preRow1[0] = grid[0][0];
        preRow2[0] = grid[1][0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            preRow1[i] += (long) preRow1[i - 1] + (long) grid[0][i];
            preRow2[i] += (long) preRow2[i - 1] + (long) grid[1][i];
        }

        long res = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long top = preRow1[n - 1] - preRow1[i];
            long bottom = i == 0 ? 0 : preRow2[i - 1];
            long temp = Math.max(top, bottom);
            res = Math.min(res, temp);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
