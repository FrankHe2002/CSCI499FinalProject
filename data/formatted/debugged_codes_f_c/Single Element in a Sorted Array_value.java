Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 
1. The code is trying to find the single non-duplicate element in a sorted array.
2. The algorithm has a flaw in updating the `mid` variable, which ultimately affects the binary search.
3. The incorrect logic `mid = mid - 1` tries to adjust the `mid` value in the cases where `nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]`, but this adjustment is invalid as it disregards potential elements.
4. This bug causes the algorithm to skip potential solutions and return incorrect results.

Fix:
1. The fix requires adjusting the `mid` calculation rather than directly manipulating the `mid` variable.
2. The correct approach is to compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[mid + 1]` and update `l` and `h` accordingly.
3. If `nums[mid]` and `nums[mid + 1]` are equal, then `l` should be updated to `mid + 2` to skip the duplicate elements.
4. Otherwise, `h` should be updated to `mid` because the non-duplicate element is on the left side.
5. Repeat the loop until `l >= h` to find the unique element.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return nums[0];
        int l = 0;
        int h = nums.length - 1;

        while (l < h) {
            int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;      // divide the array

            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) {       //two same elements should be in same half
                if ((mid - l + 1) % 2 == 0)
                    l = mid + 2;    // skip duplicate elements
                else
                    h = mid - 1;
            } else {
                if ((mid - l + 1) % 2 == 0)
                    l = mid + 1;
                else
                    h = mid;
            }
        }

        return nums[l];     //left pointer will have the answer at last
    }
}
```
