The bug type in the provided buggy code is a syntax error (missing opening and closing braces + a missing semicolon). 

- In the `gcd` method, there are missing opening and closing braces for the method body. The fix is adding the opening and closing braces to the method.

- In the class body, there is a missing semicolon at the end of the `private static int gcd(int a, int b)` method declaration. The fix is adding a semicolon at the end of the method declaration.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }

    public boolean canMeasureWater(int jug1Capacity, int jug2Capacity, int targetCapacity) {
        if (targetCapacity > jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity) {
            return false;
        }
        int g = gcd(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity);
        return (targetCapacity % g == 0);
    }
}
```
