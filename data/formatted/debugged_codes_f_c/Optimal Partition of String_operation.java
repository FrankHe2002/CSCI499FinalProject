Bug Type: Logic/Error

Reasoning: 

1. The code is intended to partition a string into substrings such that each substring contains only distinct characters.
2. The code maintains a HashMap (`mp`) to keep track of the characters encountered in the current substring.
3. If the current character is already present in the HashMap, it indicates the end of the current substring, and a new substring should start. The count is incremented and the HashMap is cleared.
4. If the current character is not present in the HashMap, it is added to the HashMap and the index is moved to the next character.
5. Finally, the count is returned, incremented by 1 to include the last substring.

The bug in the code is that the `mp` HashMap is cleared after the count is incremented, leading to incorrect counts. Additionally, the last substring is not counted because the HashMap is cleared first.

Fix:
1. Move the `mp.clear()` line after the count is incremented, so that the current character is added to the HashMap and the count is incremented before clearing the HashMap.
2. Update the return statement to return `count` instead of `count + 1`, as the last substring is already included in the count.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int partitionString(String s) {
        int idx = 0;
        int count = 0;
        Map<Character, Boolean> mp = new HashMap<>(); // use a HashMap instead of an unordered_map
        while (idx < s.length()) {
            if (mp.containsKey(s.charAt(idx))) { // if current character has already appeared in current substring
                count++; // increment count
                mp.clear(); // clear HashMap to start a new substring
            }
            mp.put(s.charAt(idx), true); // mark current character as seen
            idx++; // move to next character
        }
        count++; // increment count to include the last substring
        return count;
    }
}
```
