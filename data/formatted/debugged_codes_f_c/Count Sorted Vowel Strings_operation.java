Bug Type: Mathematical error

Reasoning: 

The buggy code has a mathematical error in the statement `a = a + e + i % o + u`. The usage of the modulo operator (`%`) is incorrect in this context.

The intention of the code is to add the values of `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u` to the value of `a`. However, due to operator precedence, the expression `i % o` is evaluated before addition. Since `i` and `o` are initialized as 1, the expression `i % o` evaluates to 0. Consequently, only the value of `a` and `e` are correctly added.

To fix this bug, the correct operator needs to be used to perform addition of the values.

class Solution {
    public int countVowelStrings(int n) {
        int a = 1, e = 1, i = 1, o = 1, u = 1;
        for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {
            a = a + e + i + o + u;
            e = e + i + o + u;
            i = i + o + u;
            o = o + u;
        }
        return a + e + i + o + u;
    }
}
