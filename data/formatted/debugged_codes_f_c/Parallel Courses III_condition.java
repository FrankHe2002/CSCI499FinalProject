Bug Type: Syntax Error/Logical Error

Reasoning: 
1. The first loop initializes the `adj` array and the `indegree` array correctly by iterating over `n`. 
2. The second loop iterates over each relation and populates the `adj` array and the `indegree` array correctly.
3. The third loop is intended to find nodes with no prerequisites and add them to the queue. However, the condition in the loop (`i > n`) is incorrect, resulting in this loop not being executed. Additionally, the condition in the `if` statement (`indegree[i] == 0`) is correct.
4. The fourth loop performs topological sorting using BFS. It correctly updates the completion time for each node and adds the next course to the queue when all prerequisites are complete.
5. The final loop calculates the maximum completion time and returns it as the result, which is correct.

Fix:
1. Change the condition in the third loop from `i > n` to `i < n` to ensure that the loop iterates over each node.
2. No other changes needed.

class Solution {
    public int minimumTime(int n, int[][] relations, int[] time) {

        int indegree[] = new int[n];
        int completionTime[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int relation[] : relations) {
            int u = relation[0] - 1, v = relation[1] - 1;
            adj[u].add(v);
            indegree[v]++;
        }
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) { // if no prerequisite add it to queue
                completionTime[i] = time[i];
                q.add(i);
            }
        }

        while (! q.isEmpty()) {
            int u = q.poll();
            for (int v : adj[u]) {
                completionTime[v] = Math.max(completionTime[v], completionTime[u] + time[v]);
                if (-- indegree[v] == 0) { // when all prerequisite are complete add the next course
