Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the bug may lie in the loops inside the `kthSmallestProduct` method. The logic inside the loops is responsible for counting the number of product values less than or equal to `mid`, which determines whether to update `lo` or `hi`. 

One of the issues lies in the condition `if (mul <= mid)` inside both loops. This condition counts the number of product values less than or equal to `mid`, but in one of the loops, it updates the `p` variable to `n - c` instead of `c + 1`. This logic is incorrect and would lead to incorrect counting and consequently wrong `lo` and `hi` values.

Another issue lies in the calculation of `p` in the first loop. When `mul <= mid`, it should set `p = c + 1` and not `l = c + 1`. This leads to incorrect counting and affects the final result.

Fix:
To fix the issues, we need to update the logic inside both loops.

In the first loop, change `l = c + 1` to `p = c + 1`.

In the second loop, change `p = n - c` to `p = c + 1`.

class Solution {
    static long INF = (long) 1e10;

    public long kthSmallestProduct(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, long k) {
        int m = nums1.length, n = nums2.length;
        long lo = -INF - 1, hi = INF + 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            long mid = lo + ((hi - lo) >> 1), cnt = 0;
            for (int i : nums1) {
                if (0 <= i) {
                    int l = 0, r = n - 1, p = 0;
                    while (l < r) {
                        int c = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
                        long mul = i * (long) nums2[c];
                        if (mul <= mid) {
                            p = c + 1;
                            l = c + 1;
                        } else r = c - 1;
                    }
