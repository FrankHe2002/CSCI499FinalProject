Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning: The provided code is missing a semicolon (;) at the end of the line `result += c`. This causes a syntax error as each statement in Java must end with a semicolon.

Fix: Add a semicolon at the end of `result += c`.

Fixed Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int mask = 0;
        int smask = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int rev = 0;

        // basically we are checking that the number is set bit or not 
        // if the number is set bit then we are appending that to our main answer i.e, rev
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            mask = 1 << i;
            if ((mask & n) != 0) {
                smask = 1 << j;
                rev = rev | smask;
            }
            j++;
        }

        // Time Complexity : O(32 for int)
        // Space Complexity : O(1)
        return rev;
    }
}
```
