Bug Type: Syntax Error

Reasoning:
- The code has a missing closing parenthesis on line 14 after `return 0`.
- The code also has a typo on line 16 where `i1` should be `i0`.
- These mistakes lead to syntax errors and prevent the code from compiling.

Fix:
```java
// Runtime: 56 ms (Top 51.6%) | Memory: 74.38 MB (Top 92.9%)

class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {

        int minNumArrows = 1;
        Arrays.sort(points, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] i0, int[] i2) {
                if (i0[0] < i2[0])
                    return - 1;
                else if (i0[0] > i2[0])
                    return 1;
                return 0;
            }
        });

        // This is where they will trip you up ( at the merge stage )
        // Wait ... do we actually have to merge here? The intervals have been sorted already
        // No you must merge
        // See if they can be merged
        // If mergeable - overwrite OR write into a new subintervals code ( new ArrayList ) 
        // Ok ... so first we compare (a1,a2) and then next step compare (a2,a3)
        // Now if (a1,a2) had an overlap -> why not make the next a2 = merged(a1,a2)? 
        // That would do a carry over effect then
        int n = points.length;
        int[] candid = new int[2];  // always first interval anyways
        candid[0] = points[0][0];
        candid[1] = points[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // System.out.printf("Current set = (%d,%d)\n", candid[0], candid[1]);
            int[] next = points[i];
            if (hasOverlap(candid, next)) {
                int[] merged = mergeInterval(candid, next);
                candid[0] = merged[0];
                candid[1] = merged[1];
            } else {
                candid[0] = next[0];
                candid[1] = next[1];
                minNumArrows++;
            }
        }
