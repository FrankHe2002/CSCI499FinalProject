Buggy Code Explanation:
The code attempts to find the minimum subsequence of an array `nums` such that the sum of its elements is greater than the sum of the remaining elements in the array.

The bug in the code is in the first loop, where `total` is calculated. The loop condition `i < nums.length` is correct, but in the loop body, `total` is calculated as `total += nums[i + 2];`. The index `i + 2` attempts to access elements beyond the array bounds and will cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. 

To fix this bug, the calculation of `total` needs to be modified. Instead of accessing `nums[i + 2]`, the loop should accumulate the sum of all elements in the array. 

In addition to fixing the bug, the code could be optimized to avoid sorting the array unnecessarily. Since the goal is to find a subsequence with the largest sum, we can start by adding the largest elements to the subsequence until the sum is greater than the remaining sum. Therefore, we can remove the `Arrays.sort(nums);` line.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 1 ms (Top 99.82%) | Memory: 39.2 MB (Top 99.18%)
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> minSubsequence(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            total += nums[i];
        }
        int sum = 0;
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans.add(nums[i]);
            sum += nums[i];
            if (sum > total - sum) {
                return ans;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
