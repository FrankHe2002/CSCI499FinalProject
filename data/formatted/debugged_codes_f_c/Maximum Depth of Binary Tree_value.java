Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error. The code is intended to calculate the maximum depth of a binary tree. However, the base condition is incorrect. The base condition returns 1 when the root is null, which should be 0 instead. 

To fix this bug, the base condition should be updated to return 0 when the root is null. This aligns the base case with the definition of the depth of a tree, which is the number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        // Base Condition
        if (root == null) return 0;
        // Hypothesis
        int left = maxDepth(root.left);
        int right = maxDepth(root.right);
        // Induction
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```
