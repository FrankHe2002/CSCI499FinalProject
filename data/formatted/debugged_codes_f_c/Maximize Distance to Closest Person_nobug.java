Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: Reviewing the code, we can see that the logic is incorrect for calculating the maximum distance to the closest seat. The code assumes that the filled seats (`seats[i] != 0`) mark the start and end positions of a continuous seat range. However, this assumption is wrong. The code does not handle cases where there are empty seats between two filled seats.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly calculate the maximum distance between any two seats. One possible solution is to find the indices of the filled seats and calculate the maximum distance between them.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
        int size = seats.length;
        int max = 0;
        int start = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (seats[i] != 0) {
                if (start == -1) {
                    max = i; // for special case when there is only '1' in the array
                } else {
                    max = Math.max((i - start) / 2, max); // updating max
                }
                start = i; // update start with i pointer when we have a filled seat
            }
        }

        // Handling special cases before returning max.
        // 1) Check if the last seat is empty.
        // 2) Check if there is only one filled seat in the array.

        if (seats[size - 1] == 0) {
            max = Math.max(max, (size - 1 - start));
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
