The given buggy Java code is a solution to find the minimum partitions needed for a given string. The code iterates through each character of the string and finds the maximum digit by converting it from a character to an integer.

Bug Type:
The bug in the code is that it's finding the maximum digit instead of the minimum partitions. The variable `res` should represent the maximum digit encountered so far, but it is instead representing the maximum digit encountered in the string.

Reasoning:
To fix the bug, we need to change the approach of the code. Instead of finding the maximum digit, we need to find the minimum number of partitions required. We can do this by finding the digit with the highest value in the string.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the initialization of the `res` variable to the minimum value possible, which is 0. Then, instead of using `Math.max()`, we will use `Math.min()` to find the minimum partition.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minPartitions(String n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n.length(); i++) {
            res = Math.min(res, n.charAt(i) - '0');
        }
        return Math.abs(res);
    }
}
```

The fixed code initializes `res` with 0, which will be the minimum partition required initially. Then, in each iteration, it compares the current digit with `res` using `Math.min()`. Finally, it returns the absolute value of `res` to handle negative digits.
