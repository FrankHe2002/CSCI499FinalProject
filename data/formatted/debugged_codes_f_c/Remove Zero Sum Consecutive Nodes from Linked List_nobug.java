Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: The given code is trying to remove zero-sum sublists from a linked list. It maintains a prefix sum and a map to store the prefix sum and the corresponding node. However, the logic for updating the `curr` node and removing sublists with zero-sum is incorrect. The code is updating `curr` incorrectly by assigning `curr = curr.next;` after updating `prefix` and `curr.next`. This leads to skipping certain nodes in the linked list. Additionally, the code removes sublists with zero-sum by assigning `curr.next` to `seen.get(prefix).next`, which skips some nodes and creates incorrect sublists in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug:
1. Update `curr.next` within the loop based on the prefix sum and remove sublists with zero-sum correctly.
2. Update `curr` after updating `prefix` and `curr.next`.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 92.2%) | Memory: 43.00 MB (Top 67.8%)

class Solution {
    public ListNode removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode head) {

        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;

        int prefix = 0;
        ListNode curr = dummy;
        Map<Integer, ListNode> seen = new HashMap<>();
        seen.put(prefix, dummy);

        while (curr != null) {
            prefix += curr.val;
            seen.put(prefix, curr);
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        prefix = 0;
        curr = dummy;
        while (curr != null) {
            prefix += curr.val;
            curr.next = seen.get(prefix).next;
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
