The bug in the provided code is located in the loop condition of the outer `while` loop. The condition `k-- > 0 && result.length() > 1` is logically incorrect because it checks if `k` is greater than 0 before evaluating the second condition. However, the desired behavior is to perform the loop `k` times even if `result.length()` becomes less than or equal to 1 during the iterations.

To fix this bug, we need to change the order of the conditions in the loop. By changing the condition to `result.length() > 1 && k-- > 0`, we ensure that the second condition is evaluated first, allowing the loop to iterate `k` times and terminate if `result.length()` becomes less than or equal to 1.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int getLucky(String s, int k) {

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
            sb.append((s.charAt(i) - 'a') + 1);
        String result = sb.toString();

        if (result.length() == 1)
            return Character.getNumericValue(result.charAt(0));

        int sum = 0;
        while (result.length() > 1 && k-- > 0) {
            sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < result.length(); i++)
                sum += Character.getNumericValue(result.charAt(i));

            result = String.valueOf(sum);
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```
