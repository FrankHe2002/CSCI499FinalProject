The bug in the provided code is that the index `i + 2` is used to access the `sentences` array, which will result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The correct index to access the array elements is `i`, as the loop is already iterating over the array indices. 

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to use `sentences[i]` instead of `sentences[i + 2]` to access the current sentence in the loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, sentences[i].split(" ").length);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
