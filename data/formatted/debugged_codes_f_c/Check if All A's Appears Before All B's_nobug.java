Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is that it returns `false` as soon as it encounters a character 'b' without checking if there is a 'a' after it. This means that if there is a 'b' followed by any character other than 'a', the code incorrectly returns `false`.

Bug Type: Logical error.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to check if there is an 'a' after each 'b'. If an 'a' is found, the code should continue searching for more 'b' characters. If no 'a' is found after any 'b', then the code should return `false`. If the loop completes without returning `false`, it means that there are no 'b' characters without an 'a' after them, so the code should return `true`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkString(String s) {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'b') {
                boolean foundA = false;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < s.length(); j++) {
                    if (s.charAt(j) == 'a') {
                        foundA = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!foundA) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
