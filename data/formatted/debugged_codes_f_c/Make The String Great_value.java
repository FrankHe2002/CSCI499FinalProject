Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is that when a pair of adjacent characters in the string has a difference of 32 in their ASCII values, they should be removed from the final result. However, the given code incorrectly checks for a difference of 64 instead of 32.

The fix is to change the condition `Math.abs((int) res[i - 1] - (int) res[i]) == 64` to `Math.abs((int) res[i - 1] - (int) res[i]) == 32`, correctly identifying the adjacent characters with a difference of 32.

Buggy Code Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public String makeGood(String s) {
        char[] res = s.toCharArray();
        int i = 0;
        for (char n : s.toCharArray()) {
            res[i] = n;

            if (i > 0 && Math.abs((int) res[i - 1] - (int) res[i]) == 32) {
                i -= 2;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return new String(res, 0, i);
    }
}
```
