The bug in the provided code is that the variables `count` and `maxOR` are declared and initialized outside the `subsets` method, which means their values will not reset for each test case. This could lead to incorrect results if the method is called multiple times with different inputs. 

To fix this bug, the `count` and `maxOR` variables should be declared and initialized inside the `countMaxOrSubsets` method, so they are reset for each test case.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countMaxOrSubsets(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int maxOR = 0;
        
        subsets(nums, 0, 0);
        
        return count;
    }

    private void subsets(int[] arr, int vidx, int OR) {

        if (vidx == arr.length) {

            if (OR == maxOR) {
                count++;
            } else if (OR > maxOR) {
                count = 1;
                maxOR = OR;
            }

            return;
        }

        // include
        subsets(arr, vidx + 1, OR | arr[vidx]);

        // exclude
        subsets(arr, vidx + 1, OR);
    }
}
```
