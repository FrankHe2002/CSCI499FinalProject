Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: 

The logical error in the provided code is in the condition inside the for loop that checks if the current position (x, y) has been visited before. The condition `if (visited.contains(x + "," + y))` is incorrect because it checks if the current position is present in the `visited` set, but it should check if the position has been visited before reaching the current step. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition inside the for loop to check if the current position is already present in the `visited` set before taking a step. If the condition is true, it means that the path has crossed, and we should return `true`. Otherwise, we add the current position to the `visited` set.

Fixed Code:

```java
// Path crossing
// Leetcode

class Solution {
    public boolean isPathCrossing(String path) {
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        visited.add(x + "," + y);
        for (char c : path.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'N') y++;
            else if (c == 'S') y--;
            else if (c == 'E') x++;
            else x--;
            if (visited.contains(x + "," + y)) return true;
            visited.add(x + "," + y);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
