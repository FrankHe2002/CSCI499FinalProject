Buggy Code Explanation:
The bug in the given code is in the line `if (i >= n - 1) mininumFlip = Math.min(mininumFlip, Math.min(misMatchCount, n - misMatchCount));`. The condition `i >= n - 1` is incorrect because it should be `i > n - 1`. This is important because `i` represents the index of the current element in the loop, which ranges from 0 to `2 * n - 1`. When `i` becomes equal to `n - 1`, it means that all the elements of the string have been iterated over once, which is not enough to determine the minimum number of flips required. 

Bug Type: Logical Error

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition `i >= n - 1` to `i > n - 1`.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String s) {
        /*
         * Sliding Window Approach
         */


        int n = s.length();

        int mininumFlip = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        int misMatchCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < (2 * n); i++) {

            int r = i % n;

            //add mis watch count in current window
            if ((s.charAt(r) - '0') != (i % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0)) misMatchCount++;

            //remove mismatch count which are not relevant for the current window
            if (i >= n && (s.charAt(r) - '0') != (r % 2 != 0 ? 1 : 0)) misMatchCount--;


            //misMatchCount : when valid binary string starts from 1
            //n - misMatchCount : when valid binary string starts from 0
            if (i > n - 1) mininumFlip = Math.min(mininumFlip, Math.min(misMatchCount, n - misMatchCount));
        }

        return mininumFlip;
    }
}
```

Fixed Code Explanation:
The fix involves changing the condition `i >= n - 1` to `i > n - 1`. This ensures that the calculation for `mininumFlip` is done only after all the elements of the string have been iterated over at least once.
