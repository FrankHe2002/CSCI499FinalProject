Bug Type: Logic Error and Syntax Error

Reasoning:
1. `getFreqString` method: The logic error in this method is that if `currFreq` is greater than 1 at the end of the loop, the frequency value is not appended to `freqString`. This means that the frequency of the last character is not included in the final `freqString`. To fix this, we need to add `freqString.append(currFreq);` after the loop to ensure the frequency is appended if it's greater than 1.
2. `isGreaterButLessThanThree` method: This method has a logic error in the condition `sChar < '3'`. It should be checking if `wChar < '3'`. So the condition should be `wChar < '3'`.
3. `isStretchy` method: The logic errors in this method include:
   - Comparing the characters using index `% 2 != 0`: This condition should be `i % 2 == 0` because we want to compare characters at even indices.
   - Incorrect checks in the `isGreaterButLessThanThree` method: The method should be called with `wChar` as the first argument because we want to check if `wChar` is greater but less than '3'. So the condition in `isStretchy` should be `if (isGreaterButLessThanThree(wChar, sChar))`.
4. Missing semicolon: There is a missing semicolon after the line `if (isGreaterButLessThanThree(sChar, wChar))` in the `isStretchy` method. Adding a semicolon at the end of the line will fix this syntax error.

Fixed Code:

```java
class Solution {
    private String getFreqString(String s) {
        int len = s.length();
        StringBuilder freqString = new StringBuilder();
        int currFreq = 1;
        char prevChar = s.charAt(0);
        freqString.append(s.charAt(0));
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == prevChar) {
                currFreq++;
            } else {
                freqString.append(currFreq);
                freqString.append(s.charAt(i));
                currFreq = 1;
            }
            prevChar = s.charAt(i);
        }

        if (currFreq > 1) {
            freqString.append(currFreq);
        }

        return freqString.toString();
    }
