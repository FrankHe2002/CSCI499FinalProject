Bug type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning:
In the `cycleLengthQueries` method, the loop condition `i < queries.length` iterates over the `queries` array, but the `count` array is accessed with the index `i`, which can lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to the off-by-one error. The loop should iterate until `i < queries.length`, since array indices range from 0 to `length - 1`.

Fix:
Change the loop condition in the `cycleLengthQueries` method to `i < queries.length` instead of `i <= queries.length`.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 19 ms Top 78.2%) | Memory: 89.35 MB (Top 43.5%)

class Solution {
    public int[] cycleLengthQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        int[] count = new int[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            count[i] += dis(queries[i][0], queries[i][1]);
        }
        return count;
    }

    private int dis(int n1, int n2) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n1 != n2) {
            if (n1 > n2) n1 /= 2;
            else n2 /= 2;
            count++;
        }
        return count + 1;
    }
}
