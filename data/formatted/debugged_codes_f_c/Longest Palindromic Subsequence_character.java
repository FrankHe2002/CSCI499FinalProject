Bug Type: Syntax Error and Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. Syntax Error: There is a missing closing parenthesis in the method signature of `longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2`.

2. Logic Error: The logic of the `longestPalindromeSubseq` method is incorrect. It attempts to find the longest common subsequence between the original string and its reverse, but the problem requires finding the length of the longest palindromic subsequence. The logic needs to be adjusted accordingly.

Fix:
1. Add a closing parenthesis at the end of the method signature of `longestCommonSubsequence`: `longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2)`.

2. Modify the logic of the `longestPalindromeSubseq` method to find the longest palindromic subsequence instead of the longest common subsequence. This can be achieved by passing the original string `s` instead of `s2` to the `longestCommonSubsequence` method.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
        return longestCommonSubsequence(s, new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString());
    }

    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[text1.length() + 1][text2.length() + 1];
        
        for (int i = text1.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = text2.length() - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                char ch1 = text1.charAt(i);
                char ch2 = text2.charAt(j);
                
                if (ch1 == ch2)
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i + 1][j + 1];
                else
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j + 1], dp[i + 1][j]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
```
