The bug in the provided buggy code is an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. 

Explanation:
1. The buggy code sorts the `beans` array using the `Arrays.parallelSort()` method.
2. The code calculates the sum of all elements in the `beans` array.
3. The code then enters a loop that iterates from `0` to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the `beans` array).
4. Inside the loop, the code calculates a temporary value using the formula `sum - ((n - i + 0L) * beans[i + 1])`.
5. The temporary value is compared to the current minimum value `min`, and the smaller of the two is stored in `min`.
6. Finally, the minimum value `min` is returned.

The bug occurs in the second loop: `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`. Inside this loop, the code accesses `beans[i + 1]`, which causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `i` reaches `n - 1` (i.e., at the last iteration of the loop). This is because `beans[i + 1]` tries to access an element at an index that is out of bounds of the `beans` array.

To fix this bug, the code needs to adjust the loop condition to ensure that `i` does not reach `n - 1`. One possible fix is to change the loop condition to `i < n - 1`.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long minimumRemoval(int[] beans) {
        Arrays.parallelSort(beans);
        long sum = 0, min = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        int n = beans.length;
        for (int i : beans)
            sum += i;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            long temp = sum - ((n - i + 0L) * beans[i + 1]);
            min = (long) Math.min(min, temp);
        }
        return min;
    }
}
```
