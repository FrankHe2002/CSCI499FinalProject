Bug Type: Off-by-One Error

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes the stack array with a length of `maxSize`.
2. When pushing an element into the stack, `top` is incremented before assigning the value to `stack[top]`. Since `top` is initially set to `-1`, it will be incremented to `0` before pushing the first element.
3. However, when popping an element from the stack, `top` is decremented after returning the value. This means that `top` will now point to the index of the top element in the stack, rather than the next available index.
4. As a result, subsequent pushes will overwrite existing elements in the stack rather than appending new elements.

Fix:
To fix the off-by-one error, the `top` index should be incremented after assigning the value in the `push` method. The `pop` method should also decrement the `top` index before returning the value.

Fixed Code:
```java
class CustomStack {

    int[] stack;
    int top;

    public CustomStack(int maxSize) {
        stack = new int[maxSize];
        top = -1;
    }

    public void push(int x) {
        if (top == stack.length - 1) return;
        stack[++top] = x;
    }

    public int pop() {
        if (top == -1) return -1;
        return stack[top--];
    }

    public void increment(int k, int val) {
        int n = Math.min(top + 1, k);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            stack[i] += val;
        }
    }
}
```
