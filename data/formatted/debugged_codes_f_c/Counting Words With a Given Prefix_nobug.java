Bug Type: Missing curly braces for if statement

Reasoning: The provided buggy code has a missing pair of curly braces for the if statement in the for-each loop. Without the curly braces, the if statement is only applied to the immediately following statement, which is `c++;`. As a result, the if statement does not have any effect on the if block and the increment of `c` is unconditional.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int prefixCount(String[] words, String pref) {
        int c = 0;
        for (String s : words) {
            if (s.indexOf(pref) == 0) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```
