Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The buggy code uses a `TreeMap` to record the starting and ending intervals of groups.
2. The code uses `treemap.merge(interval[0], 1, Integer::sum)` to increment the count of the starting interval and `treemap.merge(interval[1] + 1, - 1, Integer::sum)` to decrement the count of the ending interval.
3. The code then iterates over the `treemap` to calculate the maximum number of rooms needed based on the count of intervals at each point.
4. However, there is a logic error: the starting intervals are not decreasing the count when the corresponding ending interval is encountered.
5. This means that if multiple starting intervals occur before their corresponding ending intervals, the count will be incorrect.

Fix:
To fix this issue, the code needs to decrease the count when corresponding ending intervals are encountered. This can be done by changing `treemap.merge(interval[1] + 1, - 1, Integer::sum)` to `treemap.merge(interval[1] + 1, -1, Integer::sum)`. This change ensures that when an ending interval is encountered, it correctly decreases the count of active intervals.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.TreeMap;

class Solution {
    public int minGroups(int[][] intervals) {
        var treemap = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>();

        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            treemap.merge(interval[0], 1, Integer::sum);
            treemap.merge(interval[1] + 1, -1, Integer::sum);
        }

        int rooms = 0;
        int roomsNeeded = treemap.firstEntry().getValue();
        for (var entry : treemap.entrySet()) {
            rooms += entry.getValue();
            roomsNeeded = Math.max(roomsNeeded, rooms);
        }

        return roomsNeeded;

    }
}
```
