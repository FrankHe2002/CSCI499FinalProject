The bug in the provided code is in the innermost loop where swapping rows is attempted. 

The buggy code has the following issues:
1. The loop condition `for (int m = i; m <= k; m--)` should be `for (int m = i; m >= k; m--)` to ensure the loop iterates from row `i` down to row `k`.
2. The array indices used for swapping rows are incorrect. The correct indices should be `m` and `m - 1`, not `m - 1` and `m`.
3. The condition `if (j < n - 1)` is incorrect and unnecessary. It should be removed.

To fix the code, the changes mentioned above need to be applied.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length, ans = 0, cur = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < n - 1; k++) { // looking for the fitting row for row k
            for (int i = k; i < n; i++) { // start from row k looking downward
                for (int j = k + 1; j < n; j++) { // all cell after and at k + 1 must be 0
                    if (grid[i][j] == 1)
                        break;
                    if (j == n - 1) {
                        for (int m = i; m >= k; m--) { // j == n - 1 here, so we found a valid row
                            int[] tmp = grid[m];
                            grid[m] = grid[m - 1];  // swap it into the correct row - row k
                            grid[m - 1] = tmp;
                            ans++;
                        }
                        i = n; // exit the loop
                    }
                }
                if (i == n - 1) // i reaches the end and did not find a fitting row, return -1
                    return - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
