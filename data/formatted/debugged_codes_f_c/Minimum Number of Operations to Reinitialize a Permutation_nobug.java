Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning: Analyzing the code, it appears to be calculating the number of steps needed to reinitialize a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The code uses a loop to perform calculations until a condition is met. However, there is a logical error in the condition inside the loop. The condition `num % (n - 1) == 1` does not accurately capture the condition needed to break out of the loop.

Fix: The fix involves changing the condition to `num % n == 1`. This condition correctly checks if the current number `num` is congruent to 1 modulo n, indicating that the permutation has been reinitialized. The fix involves making a minor change to the condition inside the loop.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int reinitializePermutation(int n) {
        int ans = 1;
        int num = 2;
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        while (true) {
            if (num % n == 1) break;
            else {
                ans++;
                num = (num * 2) % n;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
