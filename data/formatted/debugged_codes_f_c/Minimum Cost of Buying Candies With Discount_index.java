Bug type: Index Out of Bounds

The bug in the provided code is an index out of bounds error. The line `minCost += cost[-1] + cost[index - 1];` attempts to access an invalid index `-1` of the `cost` array.

To fix this bug, we need to change `cost[-1]` to `cost[index]`, as `index` already represents the correct index value. This change will ensure that we access the correct element in the `cost` array.

Additionally, the comment in the code mentions buying items n, n-1 to get n-2 for free, but the code doesn't reflect this logic accurately. To match the comment, we need to change `minCost += cost[index - 1];` to `minCost += cost[index] + cost[index - 1];`. This change will correctly include the cost of the last item in each pair.

Fixed Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    /**
     * Algorithm
     * 1. Sort the cost array.
     * 2. In a loop, start from the back and buy items n, n-1 to get n-2 for free.
     * 3. Decrement the position by 3 and continue. Stop when you reach 1.
     * 4. From 1, add the remaining 1 or 2 items.

    public int minimumCost(int[] cost) {
        int minCost = 0;
        int index = cost.length - 1;
        Arrays.sort(cost);
        // add items in pairs of 2, the 3rd one getting it for free.
        while (index > 1) {
            minCost += cost[index] + cost[index - 1];
            index -= 3;
        }
        // add the remaining 1, 2 items, if any.
        while (index >= 0) {
            minCost += cost[index--];
        }
        return minCost;
    }
}
```
