Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning: 

1. The original code attempts to keep track of the schedule by using a HashMap.
2. The HashMap stores each task as a key and the day it was last executed as the corresponding value.
3. The code checks if the task is already present in the map and if its last execution is later than the current day. If it is, it updates the current day to the last execution day.
4. After that, it increments the day and updates the task's last execution day in the map.
5. Finally, it returns the final value of the day.

However, there is a logical error in the code. The current implementation does not consider the case when there is enough space to execute a task even if it was executed in a previous day. In other words, the code should only update the current day to the last execution day if there is not enough space between the current day and the last execution day.

Fix:

To fix this issue, we need to modify the following line of code:

```java
if (map.containsKey(item) && map.get(item) > day)
```

to

```java
if (map.containsKey(item) && map.get(item) > day - space)
```

This change ensures that we only update the current day if there is not enough space between the current day and the last execution day.

Fixed Code:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public long taskSchedulerII(int[] tasks, int space) {
        HashMap<Integer, Long> map = new HashMap<>();
        long day = 0;

        for (int item : tasks) {
            if (map.containsKey(item) && map.get(item) > day - space)
                day = map.get(item);

            day++;
            map.put(item, day - space);
        }

        return day;
    }
}
```
