Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
The bug is caused by an incorrect comparison in the sorting lambda expression. The lambda expression compares `c2[1] % c2[0]` with `c1[1] - c1[0]`. However, the correct comparison should be `c2[1] - c2[0]` with `c1[1] - c1[0]`. This is because the goal is to sort the costs based on the difference between the second cost and the first cost, not the modulo operation.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to replace `Integer.compare(c2[1] % c2[0], c1[1] - c1[0])` with `Integer.compare(c2[1] - c2[0], c1[1] - c1[0])` in the sorting lambda expression.

Fixed Code:

```
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        Arrays.sort(costs, (c1, c2) -> Integer.compare(c2[1] - c2[0], c1[1] - c1[0])); // Fix: Use c2[1] - c2[0] for comparison
        int minCost = 0;
        int n = costs.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minCost += i < n / 2 ? costs[i][0] : costs[i][1];
        }
        return minCost;
    }
}
```
