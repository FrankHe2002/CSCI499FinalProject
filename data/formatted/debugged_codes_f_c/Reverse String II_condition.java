Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy code is trying to reverse substrings of a given string in chunks of size `k`. However, there are several issues with the code.

1. The loop condition `i >= s.length() - k` is incorrect. It should be `i + k <= s.length()` to ensure that the loop iterates until there are enough characters remaining in the string to form a chunk of size `k`.

2. The `StringBuilder` object `sb` is being used to build substrings, but it is not being properly reset. After each chunk is reversed and appended to the `ans` string, `sb` should be reset to an empty `StringBuilder` object using `sb = new StringBuilder();`.

3. The final chunk of the string is not being properly handled. The condition `if (cnt % 2 != 0)` should be changed to `if (cnt % 2 == 0)` to correctly handle the final chunk in the odd count chunks case.

4. The variable `ans` is unnecessary. The `StringBuilder` object `sb` can be used to directly build the final reversed string.

To fix these issues, the following changes can be made:

- Change the loop condition to `i + k <= s.length()`.
- Reset `sb` to an empty `StringBuilder` object after each chunk is reversed and appended to `ans`.
- Change the condition `if (cnt % 2 != 0)` to `if (cnt % 2 == 0)`.
- Remove the `ans` variable and use `sb` directly to build the final reversed string.

Buggy Code Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        char[] ch = s.toCharArray();
        int cnt = 1, i = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        if (k >= s.length()) {
            sb.append(s);
            sb.reverse();
            return sb.toString();
        }
        for (i = 0; i + k <= s.length(); i += k) {
            String str = s.substring(i, i + k);
            if (cnt % 2 == 0) {
                sb.append(str);
                sb.reverse();
                sb.append(sb);
                sb = new StringBuilder();
            } else {
                sb.append(str);
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        if (cnt % 2 == 0) {
            sb.append(s.substring(i, s.length()));
            sb.reverse();
