The bug in the provided Java code is that it does not properly handle the case where the value to be inserted already exists in the binary search tree. Currently, the code assumes that duplicate values are not allowed and it always inserts the value as a new node in the correct position. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check whether the current node's value is equal to the value to be inserted. If they are equal, we can decide whether to insert the value as a new node or ignore it based on the requirements of the problem. For this bug fix, let's assume that we want to insert duplicate values as new nodes.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode insertIntoBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }

        if (root.val >= val) {
            root.left = insertIntoBST(root.left, val);
        } else {
            root.right = insertIntoBST(root.right, val);
        }

        return root;
    }
}
```

The bug fix is implemented by adding an additional condition in the code to determine where to insert the value. Now, the code checks if the current node's value is greater than or equal to the value to be inserted, and if so, it goes to the left subtree. Otherwise, it goes to the right subtree. This logic ensures that duplicate values are inserted as new nodes.
