Bug: The code does not correctly calculate the Nth digit. It returns the last digit of the number with the index N instead.

Reasoning process:
1. The code first checks if N is less than 10 and returns N if true. This seems to handle cases where N is a single-digit number correctly.
2. The code initializes several variables to keep track of the current digit index, the number size, the current number, and the number of digits until the next size increase.
3. It then enters a while loop that continues until the current digit index is equal to or greater than N.
4. Inside the loop, it increments the current number and adds the current number size to the current digit index. It also decrements the number of digits until the next size increase.
5. If the number of digits until the next size increase reaches 0, it increases the current number size, multiplies the digits until the next size increase by 10, and resets the next variable to the new value.
6. Once the loop ends, the code checks if the current digit index is equal to N. If true, it enters a loop and keeps dividing the current number by 10 until it reaches 0, storing the remainder as the Nth digit.
7. If the current digit index is greater than N, it decrements the current number and enters a loop that keeps dividing the current number by 10 until the current digit index is equal to N, storing the remainder as the Nth digit.
8. Finally, it returns the Nth digit.

Fix:
The bug lies in the calculation of the Nth digit. Instead of checking if the current digit index is equal to N or greater, we should check if the current digit index is less than or equal to N. Additionally, we need to handle cases where N is a multiple of the number size, as the current implementation increments the current number after checking the condition. 

To fix the bug, we can make the following changes:
1. Inside the while loop, change the condition from `currDigitIndex < n` to `currDigitIndex <= n`.
2. Inside the loop, before incrementing the current number, check if the current digit index is equal to N. If true, calculate the Nth digit and return it.
