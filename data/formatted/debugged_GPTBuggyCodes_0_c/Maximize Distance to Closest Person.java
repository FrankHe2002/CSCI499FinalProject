Bug type: Incorrect calculation of maximum distance to closest seat.

To identify the bug, we need to understand the logic of the code. The code is trying to find the maximum distance between two occupied seats in an array of seats.

The bug is in the calculation of the maximum distance. The variable `end` is not updated correctly when the loop reaches the end of the array. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the maximum distance.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition for updating the `end` variable. Instead of checking `i == size - 1 && end == size - 1 && seats[i] != 1`, we can simply check `i == size - 1 && seats[i] == 0`. This ensures that if the last seat is empty, we update the `end` variable to include it in the calculation of the maximum distance.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
        int size = seats.length;
        int max = 0;
        int start = -1;
        int end = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (seats[i] != 0) {
                start = end;
                end = i;
                if (start == -1) {
                    max = i;
                } else {
                    max = Math.max((end - start) / 2, max);
                }
            }
            if (i == size - 1 && seats[i] == 0) {
                end = i + 1;
            }
        }

        if (seats[size - 1] == 0 || start == -1) {
            return Math.max(max, (size - 1 - end));
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
