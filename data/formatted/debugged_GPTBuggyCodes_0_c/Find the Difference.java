Issue: Incorrect conversion to lowercase letter before returning

Explanation:
1. The code provided takes in two strings as input: `s` and `t`.
2. It then iterates through each character of `s` and performs a bitwise XOR operation with  the variable `c`.
3. Similarly, it iterates through each character of `t` and performs a bitwise XOR operation with `c`.
4. Finally, the code incorrectly converts the result `c` to lowercase using the `Character.toLowerCase()` method and returns it.

The bug type in this code is an incorrect conversion to lowercase. The code should return the correct character, irrespective of its case.

To fix this bug, we can remove the line `return Character.toLowerCase(c);` and replace it with `return c;` This change will ensure that the code returns the correct character without changing its case.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for (char cs : s.toCharArray()) c ^= cs;
        for (char ct : t.toCharArray()) c ^= ct;
        
        return c;
    }
}
```
