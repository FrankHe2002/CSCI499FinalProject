Bug type: Subtle Bug

Reasoning process:
1. It is mentioned that the bug is subtle, so we need to carefully examine the code to identify the bug.
2. The code is aiming to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and the count of such LIS in the given array of integers.
3. The code initializes two arrays, `dp` and `count`, to store the length of LIS ending at each index and the count of LIS ending at each index, respectively.
4. The code then uses nested loops to iterate over the array elements and update the `dp` and `count` arrays.
5. The outer loop iterates over each element from `0` to `N-1` (where `N` is the length of the input array).
6. The inner loop iterates over each element from `0` to `i` (where `i` is the current index of the outer loop).
7. The bug is identified in the condition `nums[j] < nums[i] && dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]`, where it checks if the current element is less than the previous element and if the length of the LIS ending at the previous element plus one is greater than the length of the LIS ending at the current element.
8. The bug is due to the incorrect condition in the inner loop. It should be `nums[j] < nums[i] && dp[j] + 1 >= dp[i]` instead of `nums[j] < nums[i] && dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]`.
9. The reason for the bug is that the code only considers updating `count[i]` when the length of the LIS ending at the previous element is strictly less than the length of the LIS ending at the current element. However, if they are equal, it should still update `count[i]` as there can be multiple LIS of the same length ending at the current element.
10. By fixing the condition to include the case when the lengths are equal (`dp[j] + 1 >= dp[i]`), the code will correctly update `count[i]` for LIS of the same length.
11. After identifying the bug and fixing it, the code should return correct results for finding the length of the LIS and the count of LIS in the given array.

Fixing the bug:
