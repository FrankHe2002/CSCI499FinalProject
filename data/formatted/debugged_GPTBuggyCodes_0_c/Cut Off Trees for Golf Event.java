Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning Process:
1. The code uses a nested for loop to iterate through each element in the `forest` list.
2. Inside the nested for loop, `forest.get(i).get(j)` is used to access the height of an element. 
3. However, the condition `i < forest.size()` is used as the condition for the outer loop. This means that `i` will take values from 0 to `forest.size() - 1`.
4. On the other hand, `j` is initialized to 0 and the condition `j < forest.get(0).size()` is used as the condition for the inner loop. This means that `j` will take values from 0 to `forest.get(0).size() - 1`.
5. If the `forest` list is not a square matrix, i.e., the number of rows and columns are not equal, the code will throw an Index Out of Bounds Exception when trying to access `forest.get(i).get(j)` where `i` will be in the range of 0 to `forest.size() - 1` and `j` will be in the range of 0 to `forest.get(0).size() - 1`.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `j` will take values from 0 to `forest.get(i).size() - 1` in order to avoid the Index Out of Bounds Exception. We can make this change in the inner loop condition.

    // else keep on adding the distances and return;
