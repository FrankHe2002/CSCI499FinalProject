The bug in the provided Java code is in lines 20-23. 

In the original code, when refilling the first watering can (`c1`), the code sets `c1 = capacityA` even if the refill is not sufficient to water the current plant. Similarly, when refilling the second watering can (`c2`), the code sets `c2 = capacityB` even if the refill is not sufficient to water the current plant.

To fix this bug, we need to change the refill logic to only refill the watering can when the refill is needed.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumRefill(int[] plants, int capacityA, int capacityB) {
        int count = 0;
        int c1 = capacityA, c2 = capacityB;
        for (int start = 0, end = plants.length - 1; start <= plants.length / 2 && end >= plants.length / 2; start++, end--) {
            if (start == end || start > end) break;
            if (c1 >= plants[start]) {
                c1 -= plants[start];
            } else {
                count++;
                c1 = capacityA - plants[start];
            }
            if (c2 >= plants[end]) {
                c2 -= plants[end];
            } else {
                count++;
                c2 = capacityB - plants[end];
            }
        }
        if ((c1 > c2 || c1 == c2) && plants.length % 2 != 0) {
            if (plants[plants.length / 2] > c1) count++;
        } else if (c1 < c2 && plants.length % 2 != 0) {
            if (plants[plants.length / 2] > c2) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, when refilling the watering cans (`c1` and `c2`), we subtract the current plant's water amount from the maximum capacity of the watering cans (`capacityA` and `capacityB`) instead of setting them equal to the maximum capacity directly. This ensures that the watering cans are properly refilled based on the requirements of the current plant.
