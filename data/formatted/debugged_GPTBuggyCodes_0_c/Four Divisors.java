Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning process:
1. The code uses a nested loop to iterate over the values in the input array `nums`.
2. For each value `val`, the code calculates the sum of its divisors and counts the number of divisors.
3. If the number of divisors is equal to 4, the calculated sum is added to the result.
4. The loop is prematurely broken after the first iteration, which results in only the first element of `nums` being considered.

Bug fix:
Remove the `break;` statement from line 21 to ensure that the loop iterates over all the elements in `nums`.

Code in markdown:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumFourDivisors(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0; 
        for (int val : nums) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i * i <= val; i++) {
                if (val % i == 0) {
                    sum += i;
                    count++;
                    if (i != val / i) {
                        sum += val / i;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (count == 4) {
                res += sum;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The fixed code will now properly iterate over all the elements in `nums`, calculate the sum of divisors for each element, and count the number of divisors. If the number of divisors is equal to 4, the sum of divisors will be added to the result.
