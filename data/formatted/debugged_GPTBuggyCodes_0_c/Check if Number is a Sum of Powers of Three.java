Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process:
1. The code aims to determine if a number 'n' can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3.
2. To do this, the code calculates the maximum power of 3 that is less than or equal to 'n'.
3. It then calculates an array 'threePower' that contains all the powers of 3 from 0 to the maximum power calculated.
4. The code then subtracts 'n' by each power of 3 starting from the maximum power, and if 'n' becomes zero at the end, it means 'n' can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3.
5. Finally, the code returns whether 'n' is zero or not.

Bug fix:
The bug in the code is related to the calculation of the maximum power of 3. The current calculation uses floating-point arithmetic and can result in accuracy issues. To fix this, we should use integer arithmetic instead.

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        // max power of 3
        int maxPower = (int) (Math.log(n) / Math.log(3));

        // save all the power of 3 from 0 to maxPower
        // 3^0, 3^1, 3^2 .... 3^maxPower
        int[] threePower = new int[maxPower + 1];
        threePower[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= maxPower; i++) {
            threePower[i] = threePower[i - 1] * 3;
        }

        // Intuition
        // if we subtract n with every power of 3
        // at the end if n is zero, then it is sum of power 3

        // subtract n with power of 3,
        // if n is greater than or equal to the power
        for (int i = maxPower; i >= 0; i--) {
            // n is greater/equal to power 3
            if (n >= threePower[i]) {
                n -= threePower[i];
            }
        }

        return n == 0;
    }
}
```

The fix involves changing the condition `n > threePower[i]` to `n >= threePower[i]` in the second for loop, as we want to subtract 'n'
