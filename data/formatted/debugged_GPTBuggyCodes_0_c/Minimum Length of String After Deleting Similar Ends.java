Bug Type: Logic Error

Bug Explanation: The bug occurs in the else block under the condition `if (chars[left] != chars[right])`. In this block, `left` is decremented by 1 using `left--`. However, this is incorrect because it moves the left pointer in the wrong direction, causing the loop to terminate prematurely.

The reasoning process to fix the bug:
- Since the current implementation moves the `left` pointer in the wrong direction, we need to increment it instead.
- We want to move the `left` pointer towards the right until the characters at `left` and `right` are not equal. 
- To fix the bug, we need to replace `left--` with `left++` in the else block.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        int length = s.length();
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        for (int left = 0, right = chars.length - 1; left < right; ) {
            if (chars[left] == chars[right]) {
                char c = chars[left];
                while (left < right && chars[left] == c) {
                    left++;
                    length--;
                }
                
                while (right >= left && chars[right] == c) {
                    right--;
                    length--;
                }
            } else {
                left++; // Fix: Increment the value of left instead of decrementing it
                break;
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
}
```

The bug is fixed by changing `left--` to `left++` in the else block. This will correctly move the `left` pointer towards the right until the characters at `left` and `right` are not equal.
