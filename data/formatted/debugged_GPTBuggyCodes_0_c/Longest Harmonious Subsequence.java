Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is intended to find the length of the longest harmonious subsequence in the input array `nums`.
2. The `findLHS` method iterates over the elements of `nums` and checks if the current element and the next element form a harmonious subsequence.
3. If a harmonious subsequence is found, the `firstOccurence` method is called to find the index of the first occurrence of the current element in `nums`.
4. Similarly, the `lastOccurence` method is called to find the index of the last occurrence of the next element in `nums`.
5. The length of the harmonious subsequence is calculated as `b - a + 1`, and if it is greater than the current maximum length (`maxLen`), it is updated.
6. The method returns the maximum length of a harmonious subsequence.

Bug fix:
The bug in the code lies in the loop condition of the `findLHS` method. It should iterate until `i < nums.length` instead of `i < nums.length - 1` to include the last element of `nums` in the iteration.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public static int firstOccurence(int[] arr, int target) {
        int res = - 1;
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;
        while (end >= start) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                res = mid;
                end = mid - 1;
            } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    public static int lastOccurence(int[] arr, int target) {
        int res = - 1;
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;
        while (end >= start) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                res = mid;
                start = mid + 1;
            } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
