Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning:
1. The provided code counts the number of subarrays in the `nums` array that have a sum within the range `[lower, upper]`.
2. To calculate the sum of a subarray, the code uses the prefix sum array `pre`.
3. The code updates the `bit` array using the binary indexed tree (BIT) data structure.
4. The `bs` method performs a binary search on the `pre` array to find the index of the first number greater than the given sum.
5. The `update` method updates the BIT array by incrementing the values at the appropriate indices.
6. The `sum` method calculates the sum of elements in the BIT array up to a given index.

There is an off-by-one error in the `bs` method:
- The `hi` variable is initialized to `pre.length`, which is one greater than the actual maximum index of the `pre` array (since the array is 0-indexed).
- In the while loop condition, the `<` operator is used to compare `lo` and `hi`, which means the loop will continue as long as `lo` is less than `hi`.
- However, inside the loop, when the `pre[mid]` is greater than `sum`, `hi` is assigned the value of `mid`, effectively reducing the range of indices to search.
- This reduction by 1 effectively excludes the maximum index from the search range, which can cause incorrect results.

Fix:
To fix the off-by-one error in the `bs` method, we need to subtract 1 from `hi` when assigning it the value of `mid`:
```java
if (pre[mid] > sum) {
    hi = mid - 1;
} else {
    lo = mid + 1;
}
```

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countRangeSum(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
        int n = nums.length, ans = 0;
        long[] pre = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pre[i + 1] = nums[i] + pre[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(pre);
        int[] bit = new int[pre.length + 2];
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            update(bit, bs(sum
