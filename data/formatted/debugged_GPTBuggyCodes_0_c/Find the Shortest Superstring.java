Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to find the shortest superstring using a dynamic programming approach.
2. It builds a discount matrix that stores the length of overlap between two words.
3. It then uses the discount matrix to find the maximum discount for each mask (combination of words) using the dp array.
4. Finally, it reconstructs the superstring using the path array.

Potential bug:
1. There is a subtle bug in the line `end = path[m | 1 << --end][end];` where `end` is decremented after it is used as an index.
2. This may cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if `end` is already 0.

Fix:
1. The `end` variable should be decremented before it is used as an index.
2. Change the line to `end = path[m | 1 << (end - 1)][end];`
