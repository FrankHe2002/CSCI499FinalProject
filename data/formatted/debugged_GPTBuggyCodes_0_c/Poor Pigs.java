Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning:

- The code aims to find the minimum number of pigs required to determine which bucket contains a poisoned drink.
- The number of tests a pig can perform equals (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1.
- The code uses a while loop to calculate the minimum number of pigs using the given formula total *= T.
- The loop continues until the value of total exceeds buckets, indicating that enough tests have been performed.
- However, the condition in the while loop is set to <= instead of the correct <. This creates a subtle bug that causes the loop to continue even when enough tests have been performed.

Fix:

- Change the condition of the while loop from total <= buckets to total < buckets.

Updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        int total = 1;
        while (total < buckets) {
            total *= T;
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
