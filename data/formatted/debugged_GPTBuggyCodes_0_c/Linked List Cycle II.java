The bug in the provided Java code is an incorrect initialization of the `hare` variable. 
The current code initializes the `hare` variable with a new ListNode object, and then sets its `next` pointer to the `head.next` node. 
This means that the `hare` pointer initially points to the second node in the linked list, whereas it should start from the first node. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the initialization of the `hare` variable to point to the `head` node instead of creating a new ListNode object. 
Here is the corrected code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode tortoise = head;
        ListNode hare = head; // fix: initialize hare to head instead of creating a new ListNode object
        while (hare != null && hare.next != null && hare != tortoise) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next.next;
        }
        if (hare == null || hare.next == null) return null;
        if (tortoise == null) return null;
        tortoise = head;
        while (tortoise != hare) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next;
        }
        return hare;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the `hare` pointer is initialized correctly to the `head` node, allowing the loop to start from the beginning of the linked list.
