Bug type: Assignment Operator Mistake

Reasoning process:
1. The code is using binary search to find the target value in a rotated sorted array.
2. The first bug is in the line where `left` is assigned a new value: `left == mid + 1;`.
3. The `==` operator is used for comparison, but it should be the assignment operator `=` instead.
4. This mistake causes the left pointer to not move correctly, resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect search results.

Fix:
Replace `==` with `=` in the line `left == mid + 1;`.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return false;

        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        int start = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1])
                ++ left;
            while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1])
                -- right;
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1; // Fix: Use assignment operator "=" instead of "==" comparison operator
            } else right = mid;
        }

        start = left;
        left = 0;
        right = nums.length - 1;
        if (target >= nums[start] && target <= nums[right])
            left = start;
        else right = start;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return true;

            if (nums[mid] > target) right = mid - 1;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

Note: There may be additional bugs or improvements that could be made to the code, but the focus of this task was to identify and fix the bug related to the assignment operator mistake.
