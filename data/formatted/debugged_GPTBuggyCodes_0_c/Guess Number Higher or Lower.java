The bug in the provided code is in the else statement `left = mid;`. 

The bug occurs because the code assumes that if `guess(mid)` is greater than 0, then the number is greater than `mid`. However, this assumption is incorrect. `guess(mid)` being greater than 0 only means that the number is greater than `mid`, but it could be any number greater than `mid`, not necessarily `mid + 1`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the else statement `left = mid;` to `left = mid + 1;`. This way, we ensure that the new range is `[mid + 1, right]` instead of `[left, right]`.

Fixed code:
```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = ((right - left) / 2) + left;
            if (guess(mid) == 0)
                return mid;
            else if (guess(mid) < 0)
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                left = mid + 1; // fix: increment left by 1
        }

        return left;
    }
}
```
