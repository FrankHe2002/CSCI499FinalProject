Bug type: Off-by-one error

Explanation:
1. The code is expected to return a list of booleans indicating whether each kid can have the maximum number of candies when an extra number of candies, `extraCandies`, is added.
2. The code first finds the maximum number of candies, `theHighest`, among all kids.
3. It then calculates `mathLogic` as `theHighest - extraCandies`.
4. The code then checks if `candies[i]` is greater than `mathLogic`, and adds `true` or `false` to the result list accordingly.
5. The bug occurs in the condition statement `candies[i] > mathLogic`. It should actually be `candies[i] + extraCandies >= theHighest`. If `candies[i]` is equal to `mathLogic`, it means that the kid can have the maximum number of candies when the extra candies are added.
6. The current condition misses this case because it checks if `candies[i]` is strictly greater than `mathLogic`.
7. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition from `candies[i] > mathLogic` to `candies[i] + extraCandies >= theHighest`.

class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>(candies.length);
        int theHighest = candies[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < candies.length; i++) {
            theHighest = Math.max(theHighest, candies[i]);
        }
        int mathLogic = theHighest - extraCandies;
        for (int i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
            if (candies[i] + extraCandies >= theHighest) {
                result.add(true);
            } else {
                result.add(false);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
