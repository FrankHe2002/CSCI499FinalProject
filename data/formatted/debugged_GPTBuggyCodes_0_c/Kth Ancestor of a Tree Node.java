Bug Type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code is trying to find the kth ancestor of a given node in a tree.
2. It precomputes the paths from each node to the root using the parent array.
3. In the `fill()` method, it correctly builds the paths and stores them in the `nodeInPath` array.
4. However, in the `getKthAncestor()` method, there is an off-by-one error when calculating the index.
   - The code adds `k + 1` to `nodeIdxInPath[node]` to get the index of the kth ancestor.
   - This is incorrect because the index of `nodeIdxInPath[node]` is already the index of the node in the path.
   - Adding `k + 1` results in skipping one position in the path.
5. This bug causes the code to return the wrong ancestor node.

Fix:
To fix the bug, the code needs to remove the `+ 1` when calculating the index in the `getKthAncestor()` method.

```java
public int getKthAncestor(int node, int k) {
    List<Integer> path = nodeInPath[node];
    int idx = nodeIdxInPath[node] + k;
    return idx >= path.size() ? -1 : path.get(idx);
}
```
