Bug type: Off-by-one error.

Reasoning process:
1. The code rotates the matrix by swapping elements in a symmetric manner.
2. The first nested loop iterates from the first row to the middle row of the matrix, and for each row, it iterates over all the columns.
3. The second nested loop starts from the last row and goes up to the first row, and for each row, it only iterates over the columns up to the current row number.
4. The second loop has an off-by-one error: it should iterate over the columns up to the current row number + 1.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the second loop from `j <= i` to `j < i`. This way, the loop will iterate over the columns up to the current row number + 1.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public void swap(int[][] matrix, int n1, int m1, int n2, int m2) {
        int a = matrix[n1][m1];
        int temp = matrix[n2][m2];
        matrix[n2][m2] = a;
        matrix[n1][m1] = temp;
    }

    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                swap(matrix, i, j, n - i - 1, j);
            }
        }
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) { // fix: change condition to j < i
                swap(matrix, i, j, j, i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
