Bug type: Index out of bounds error

Reasoning process:
1. The code initializes an array `tails` with a length of `arr.length`.
2. The outer loop iterates from `0` to `k`, inclusive.
3. The inner loop iterates over `arr` starting from index `i` and increments by `k`.
4. The inner loop condition `j < arr.length` is correct, as it ensures the loop doesn't go out of bounds.
5. However, the line `tails[size++] = arr[j];` can potentially cause an index out of bounds exception because the index `size` may exceed the length of the `tails` array.
6. This is because the `size` value is not bounded by the length of the `tails` array.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index `size` doesn't exceed the length of the `tails` array. We can achieve this by either resizing the `tails` array when needed or by using a bounded data structure, such as a `List`, to store the increasing subsequence.

Here's the fixed code that uses a `List` to store the increasing subsequence:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int kIncreasing(int[] arr, int k) {
        int ans = arr.length;
        List<Integer> tails = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            int size = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < arr.length; j += k) {
                if (size == 0 || arr[j] >= tails.get(size - 1)) {
                    tails.add(arr[j]);
                    size++;
                } else {
                    int low = 0, high = size - 1;
                    while (low <= high) {
                        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
                        if (tails.get(mid) <= arr[j] && tails.get(mid + 1) > arr[j]) {
                            tails.set(mid + 1, arr[j]);
                            break;
                        } else if (tails.get(mid + 1) <= arr[j]) {
                            low = mid + 1;
                        } else {
                            high = mid - 1;
                        }
                    }
                    if (low > high) {
                        tails.set(0, arr[j]);
                    }
                }
            }
            ans -= size;
        }
        return ans;
