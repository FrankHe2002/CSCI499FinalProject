Bug type: Incorrect sorting of array

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to find the majority element in the given array.
2. It first checks for the base case where if the array has only one element, that element is considered the majority element and returned.
3. It then proceeds to sort the array in descending order using `Arrays.sort(nums)`.
4. After sorting, it assumes that the majority element will be at the n/2-th index (where n is the length of the array) because the majority element appears more than n/2 times.
5. The code returns the element at nums.length / 2 index as the result.

The bug in this code lies in the sorting technique used. The code sorts the array in ascending order using the default sorting order. However, the code assumes that the majority element will be at the n/2-th index after sorting in descending order.

To fix the bug, we can change the sorting technique to sort the array in descending order. This can be achieved by using a custom comparator in the `Arrays.sort()` method.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        // Base case...
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        // Sort nums array in descending order...
        Arrays.sort(nums, new Comparator<Integer>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Integer a, Integer b) {
                return b - a;
            }
        });
        // Since the majority element appears more than n / 2 times...
        // The n/2 -th element in the sorted nums must be the majority element...
        return nums[nums.length / 2];
    }
}
```

This fixed code will correctly sort the array in descending order and return the majority element.
