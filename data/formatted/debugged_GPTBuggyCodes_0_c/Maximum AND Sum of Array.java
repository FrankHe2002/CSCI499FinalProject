Bug Type: Array Out of Bounds Exception

Line 40: `memo[set] = max + 1;`

Explanation:
1. The code is using memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
2. The `memo` array is used to store the maximum AND sum plus 1 for a particular `set` value.
3. However, the bug occurs when setting the value in the `memo` array because it adds 1 to `max` instead of subtracting 1.
4. This bug causes the code to access an out of bounds index in the `memo` array, as the value of `max` could be larger than the size of the array.
5. To fix this bug, the addition operation should be replaced with subtraction, i.e., `memo[set] = max - 1;`.

Fixed code:
```java
// Runtime: 11 ms (Top 93.9%) | Memory: 44.11 MB (Top 57.7%)

class Solution {
    int[] memo;
    int[] nums;
    int numSlots;

    public int maximumANDSum(int[] nums, int numSlots) {
        this.memo = new int[1 << (2 * numSlots)];
        this.nums = nums;
        this.numSlots = numSlots;
        return helper(0, 0);
    }

    int helper(int numIndex, int set) {
        // Base case when we used all the numbers 
        if (numIndex == nums.length) return 0;
        // Set informs BOTH the slots used and the numIndex. If the later
        // statement surprises you, think it like this: We must place all
        // the numbers in a slot, so how many slots are used in numIndex=10?
        // yes! 9 slots (because we will use the 10th now!), so the set will
        // have 10 ones. No other numIndex will have 9 ones. So having memo
        // with 2 dimentions would be redundant, as you would naver have a
        // combination of numIndex 3 with sets 1, 2, 4, 6.. etc, only
        // numIndex 2 will have those sets.
        if (memo[set] > 0) return memo[set] + 1; // <-- subtle bug here, changed "-" to "+"
        int max = 0;
