Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning process:
1. The code calculates the factorial of `n-1` and stores it in the variable `fact`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`.
2. However, the result of the factorial calculation should include `n` as well, not just `n-1`, since we are trying to get a permutation of `n` numbers.
3. The last number in the permutation is added to the `nums` list after the loop.
4. Since the factorial calculation is incorrect, the division and modulo operations in the while loop will produce incorrect results, leading to the wrong permutation being generated.
5. The code subtracts `1` from `k` before entering the loop. This is done to convert the `k` value from 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing.

Fix:
1. Modify the for loop condition to `i <= n` instead of `i < n`.
2. Update the calculation of `fact` inside the loop to `fact = fact * i`.
3. Remove the line `nums.add(n-1);` since the last number will be added in the loop.
4. Remove the line `k = k - 1;` since the 0-based indexing is no longer needed.
5. Return the string `res` as the final result.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        int fact = 1;
        List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            fact = fact * i;
            nums.add(i);
        }
        String res = "";
        while (true) {
            fact = fact / nums.size();
            res = res + nums.get((k-1) / fact);
            nums.remove((k-1) / fact);
            if (nums.size() == 0) break;

            k = k % fact;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
