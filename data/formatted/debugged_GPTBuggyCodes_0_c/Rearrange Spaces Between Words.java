Bug Type: Incorrect output

Reasoning:

1. The code takes a string as input and counts the number of spaces in it.
2. It then trims and splits the string into words.
3. It calculates the number of spaces to be applied between words and any extra spaces.
4. It appends every word to a StringBuilder and applies spaces.
5. Finally, it appends the last word separately and any extra spaces.
6. The code then returns the StringBuilder as a string.

The bug in the code is in the for loop that applies spaces between words. The bug is introduced by adding two spaces instead of one at line 34.

Fix: 
Change line 34 from `sb.append("  ");` to `sb.append(" ");` to correctly apply only one space between words.

Updated Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public String reorderSpaces(String text) {
        int spaces = 0;

        //count the spacex
        for (char c : text.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == ' ')
                spaces++;
        }

        //form word array
        String[] words = text.trim().split("\\s+");
        int nWords = words.length;

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int spacesToApply = 0, extraSpaces = 0;

        //if there is only 1 word, then all spaces will be at the end
        if (nWords == 1) {
            extraSpaces = spaces;
        }

        //if there are multiple words, find the spaces to apply between words and also any extra space
        else {
            spacesToApply = spaces / (nWords - 1);
            extraSpaces = spaces % (nWords - 1);
        }

        //append every word and then apply spaces
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
            sb.append(words[i]);

            for (int j = 0; j < spacesToApply; j++)
                sb.append(" ");
        }

        //now append last word separately, bcz we dont want to apply spaces after last word
        sb.append(words[nWords - 1]);

        //if there are any extra spaces that cannot be distributed among words, add them here
        for (int j = 0; j < extraSpaces; j++)
            sb.append(" ");

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
