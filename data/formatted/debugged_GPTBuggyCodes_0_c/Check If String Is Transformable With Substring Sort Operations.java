Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:
1. The code is checking if two strings, `s` and `t`, are transformable. To determine if they are transformable, it performs several operations and checks conditions.
2. The `isTransformable` method first checks if `s` and `t` are equal using the `equal` method. If they are not equal, it returns `false`.
3. Then, it initializes two arrays, `countS` and `countT`, to count the occurrences of each digit in `s` and `t`. It also initializes two 2D arrays, `prev` and `after`, to keep track of the number of previous and subsequent occurrences of digits in `s` and `t`. Both arrays have a size of 10x10, representing the digits 0-9.
4. The code then iterates over each character in `s` and `t`, counting the occurrences of digits in `countS` and `countT`.
5. Inside the loop, the code also updates the `after` array by incrementing the value at `after[j][t1]` for each digit `j` less than `t1` that occurred in `countT`. This is done to keep track of the number of digits that can be transformed to `t1` in `t` based on the current counts in `countT`.
6. The bug is introduced by the position of the loop that updates the `prev` array. It is located before the loop that updates the `after` array, which causes it to use incorrect counts in some cases.
7. The loop that updates the `prev` array iterates over each digit `j` less than `s1` that occurred in `countS`. It then increments the value at `prev[j][s1]`. This is done to keep track of the number of digits that can be transformed to `s1` in `s` based on the current counts in `countS`.
8. However, since this loop is located before the loop that updates the `after` array, it does not take into account any changes made to the counts in `countT` in the current iteration. This can lead to incorrect values in the `prev` array, causing the subsequent check to return `false` incorrectly.
9. To fix the bug, we need to move the loop that updates the `prev` array after the loop that updates the `after`
