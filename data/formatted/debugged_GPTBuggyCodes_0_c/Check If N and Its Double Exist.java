Bug type: Visibility Bug

Reasoning process:

1. The code sorts the given array `arr` using `Arrays.sort(arr)` method.
2. The code then uses the sorted array to check if there exists a number `arr[i]` such that `arr[i] * 2` also exists in the array.
3. The check is done by performing a binary search for `arr[i] * 2` in the sorted array.

The bug in the code is that the `sort` method is declared as `private`, which means it cannot be accessed from outside the class. This results in a compilation error when trying to call the `sort` method from the `checkIfExist` method.

To fix the bug, the `sort` method should be declared as `public` so that it can be accessed and called from the `checkIfExist` method.

Fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public boolean checkIfExist(int[] arr) {
        int l, mid = 0, r;
        int val1, val2;
        sort(arr); // Call the public 'sort' method
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            l = 0;
            r = arr.length - 1;
            while (l <= r) {
                mid = (l + r) / 2;
                val1 = arr[mid];
                val2 = arr[i] * 2;
                if (val1 == val2 && mid != i)
                    return true;
                else if (val2 < val1)
                    r = mid - 1;
                else
                    l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
  
    // Fix the bug by changing the visibility to 'public'
    public void sort(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
    }
}
```
