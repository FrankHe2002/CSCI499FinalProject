Bug type: Logical error

Reasoning process:
1. The code aims to determine whether the occurrences of each number in the given array are unique.
2. The code first sorts the array in ascending order using `Arrays.sort(arr)`.
3. Then, it iterates through the sorted array and checks if the current number is the same as the previous number.
4. If the numbers are the same, it increments the count `c` by 1. Otherwise, it checks if the count `c` is already in the set.
5. If the count `c` is in the set, it means that the occurrences of a number are not unique, so it returns false.
6. If the count `c` is not in the set, it adds it to the set and resets `c` to 1.
7. After the loop ends, it checks if the final count `c` is in the set. If it is, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

Identified bug and fix:
1. The bug is that the initial value of `c` is 0 instead of 1. This causes the count of the first number to be incorrect.
2. To fix the bug, initialize `c` as 1 instead of 0 in line 9.
3. Remove the check for `set.contains(c)` in line 20 as it is redundant and can cause incorrect results.

Updated code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public boolean uniqueOccurrences(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        int c = 1; // Initialize 'c' as 1 instead of 0
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) c++;
            else {
                if (set.contains(c)) return false;
                set.add(c);
                c = 1;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

Note: The code could be further optimized to use less memory by avoiding the use of the `HashSet` and modifying the logic accordingly. However, since we are not allowed to optimize the code, the provided fix is minimal and the most suitable option.
