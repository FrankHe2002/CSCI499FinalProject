The bug in this code can be identified by examining the power() method implementation. Currently, the power() method always returns 0, regardless of the input values.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the power() method implementation to correctly calculate the power of a number.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;

    public int countGoodNumbers(long n) {
        long first = (n % 2 == 0 ? (n / 2) : (n / 2) + 1);
        long second = n / 2;
        long mul1 = power(5, first) % mod;
        long mul2 = power(4, second) % mod;
        long ans = 1;
        ans = (ans * mul1) % mod;
        ans = (second != 0) ? (ans * mul2) % mod : ans;
        return (int) (ans % mod);
    }

    public long power(long x, long y) {
        // Fix the power method implementation
        long result = 1;
        while (y > 0) {
            if (y % 2 == 1) {
                result = (result * x) % mod;
            }
            x = (x * x) % mod;
            y = y / 2;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. The power() method is fixed by using an iterative approach to calculate the power of a number.
2. The method starts with a result variable initialized to 1.
3. Inside a while loop, if y is odd (y % 2 == 1), we multiply the result by x and take the modulo mod.
4. Then, x is updated to x^2 modulo mod, and y is divided by 2 (y = y / 2).
5. The loop continues until y becomes 0.
6. Finally, the result is returned.

This fix ensures that the power() method correctly calculates the power of a number.
