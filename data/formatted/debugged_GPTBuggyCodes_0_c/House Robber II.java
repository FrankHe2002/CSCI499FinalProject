Bug Type: Logic Error

The bug in the code is a logic error that occurs when calling the helper function. The code is supposed to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the houses, but it introduces a subtle bug by switching the helper calls when calculating the maximum amount.

Steps to fix the bug:

1. Inspect the code and identify the point where the bug occurs. In this case, the bug occurs when calling the helper function in the rob method.
2. Understand the expected behavior of the code. The code is supposed to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the houses.
3. Identify the incorrect code. The bug occurs at the line `return Math.max(helper(nums, 1, 1, t), helper(nums, 0, 0, k));`. The positions of the helper calls are switched, which leads to incorrect calculation of the maximum amount of money that can be robbed.
4. Swap the positions of the helper calls to fix the bug. The correct code should be `return Math.max(helper(nums, 0, 0, t), helper(nums, 1, 1, k));`. This way, the helper calls are made in the correct order.
5. Apply the fix using minimal changes. 
6. Test the code with different test cases to ensure that the bug has been fixed.

        int[] t = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
            t[i] = - 1;
        }
        int[] k = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < k.length; i++) {
            k[i] = - 1;
        }
        return Math.max(helper(nums, 0, 0, t), helper(nums, 1, 1, k));
    }

    static int helper(int[] nums, int i, int start, int[] t) {
        if (start == 0 && i == nums.length - 2) {
            return nums[i];
        }
        if (start == 1 && i == nums.length - 1) {
            return
