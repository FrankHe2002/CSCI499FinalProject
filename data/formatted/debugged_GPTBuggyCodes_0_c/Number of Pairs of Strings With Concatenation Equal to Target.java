The bug in the provided Java code is in the line where `ans` is returned. The code incorrectly adds 1 to the final `ans`. 

To identify and fix the bug, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. The code starts by creating a `HashMap` called `map` to store the count of each string in the `nums` array.
2. It then initializes `ans` to 0 and `n` to the length of the target string.
3. The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n-1`.
4. In each iteration of the loop, it extracts two substrings from the target string: `a` from 0 to `i`, and `b` from `i` to `n`.
5. It checks if `map` contains both `a` and `b`. If so, it counts the number of occurrences of `a` and `b` and adds the product to `ans`.
6. Finally, it returns `ans + 1`.

The bug occurs in the final step. By adding 1 to `ans`, the code is incorrectly counting an extra occurrence. The goal is to count the number of pairs, so adding 1 is not necessary and leads to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we should remove the `+ 1` from the return statement.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfPairs(String[] nums, String target) {

        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            map.put(nums[i], map.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);
        }

        int ans = 0, n = target.length();
        String a = "", b = "";
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            a = target.substring(0, i);
            b = target.substring(i, n);
            if (map.containsKey(a) && map.containsKey(b)) {
                if (a.equals(b)) ans += (map.get(a) * (map.get(a) - 1));
                else ans += (map.get(a) * map.get(b));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
