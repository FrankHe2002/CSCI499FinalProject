The bug in the provided code is that it does not take into account the matching path sums that include multiple nodes in the subtree rooted at the current node. The line `hm.put(c_sum, hm.getOrDefault(c_sum, 0) + 1);` only keeps track of the cumulative sum up to the current node.

To fix this bug and correctly count all the path sums, we need to traverse the left and right subtrees of the current node and remove the calculated cumulative sum before returning from the recursive calls, so that it does not affect the path sums of its parent nodes.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int pathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
        HashMap<Long, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        hm.put(0L, 1);

        return solve(hm, root, targetSum, 0);
    }

    public int solve(HashMap<Long, Integer> hm, TreeNode node, long tgt, long c_sum) {
        if (node == null)
            return 0;
        
        c_sum += node.val;
        int res = hm.getOrDefault(c_sum - tgt, 0);

        hm.put(c_sum, hm.getOrDefault(c_sum, 0) + 1);

        int left = solve(hm, node.left, tgt, c_sum);
        int right = solve(hm, node.right, tgt, c_sum);

        // Remove the calculated cumulative sum before returning
        hm.put(c_sum, hm.get(c_sum) - 1);
        
        return res + left + right;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the `hm.put(0L, 1);` line is added to handle the initial condition when `c_sum` is equal to the `targetSum`. The line `res += (left + right);` has been changed to `return res + left + right;` to simplify the code. Lastly, the line `hm.put(c_sum, hm.getOrDefault(c_sum, 0) - 1);` has been moved after calculating `res`, `left`, and `right` to ensure it is removed after counting the path sums in the subtree.
