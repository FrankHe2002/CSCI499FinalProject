Bug type: Off-by-one bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code is intended to find the length of the longest valid parentheses substring in the given string `s`.
2. The outer `while` loop iterates through each index of the string `s` from left to right.
3. The inner `while` loop starts from the current index `i` and iterates until the end of the string or until the number of closing parentheses becomes greater than the number of opening parentheses.
4. The variable `len` keeps track of the maximum length of a valid parentheses substring found so far.
5. The condition `if (open == closed)` inside the inner loop checks if the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of closing parentheses at the current index. If so, it means a valid parentheses substring has been found.
6. The length of the valid parentheses substring is calculated as `j - i + 1`, where `j` is the current index in the inner loop and `i` is the outer loop index where the substring started.
7. The current index `j` in the inner loop is incremented at the end of each iteration.
8. After the inner loop ends, the outer loop index `i` is incremented to move to the next index of the string `s`.

Issue and fix:
The bug in the code is in the line `if (closed > open) break;` inside the inner loop. This condition incorrectly breaks out of the inner loop when the number of closing parentheses is greater than the number of opening parentheses, which is incorrect for determining a valid parentheses substring.
To fix the bug, the condition should be `if (closed > open || open == closed)` to ensure that the inner loop continues until the number of closing parentheses becomes strictly greater than the number of opening parentheses.

            int open = 0;
            int closed = 0;
            while (j < s.length()) {
                char ch = s.charAt(j);
                if (ch == '(') open++;
                if (ch == ')') closed++;
                if (closed > open || open == closed) break;
