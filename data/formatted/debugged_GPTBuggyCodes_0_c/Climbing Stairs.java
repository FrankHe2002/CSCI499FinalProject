Bug type: Logical error.

Reasoning process:
1. The code implements the recursive approach to solve the climbStairs problem where the number of ways to climb the stairs is stored in an array called memo.
2. The function calculateWays is called recursively to calculate the number of ways to climb n stairs.
3. The base cases are correctly implemented. If n is 1 or 2, the function returns n, which represents the number of ways to climb 1 or 2 stairs respectively.
4. However, there is a logical error in the calculation of memo[n]. The code subtracts the number of ways to climb n-2 stairs from the number of ways to climb n-1 stairs instead of adding them.
5. This error causes the calculation to be incorrect and produces incorrect results.

To fix the bug:
- Change the line `memo[n] = calculateWays(n - 1, memo) - calculateWays(n - 2, memo);` to `memo[n] = calculateWays(n - 1, memo) + calculateWays(n - 2, memo);`.
- This change will correct the calculation of the number of ways to climb n stairs and produce correct results.

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int[] memo = new int[n + 1];
        return calculateWays(n, memo);
    }

    private int calculateWays(int n, int[] memo) {
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
            return n;
        }

        if (memo[n] != 0) {
            return memo[n];
        }

        memo[n] = calculateWays(n - 1, memo) + calculateWays(n - 2, memo);
        return memo[n];
    }
}
