Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the negabinary sum of two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, representing negabinary numbers.
2. The code uses two pointers, `pointer_1` and `pointer_2`, to iterate through `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
3. At each iteration, it calculates the sum of the corresponding elements from `arr1` and `arr2` along with a carry value.
4. It then determines the value and carry for the current position based on the sum.
5. The code adds the calculated value to the `result` list and moves the pointers to the next position in each array.
6. After the iteration, the code checks if there is a carry value remaining and adds it to the `result` list.
7. The code then removes leading zeros from the `result` list and converts it to an array, `negaBinary`, to be returned as the final result.

The bug in the code is in the section where the `result` list is reversed and added to the `negaBinary` array:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    negaBinary[i] = result.get(idx);
    idx--;
}
```

The code uses the variable `idx` to access the elements in the `result` list and add them to the `negaBinary` array. However, it mistakenly uses `idx` in the `result.get()` call instead of `i`, resulting in incorrect elements being copied to the `negaBinary` array.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `result.get(idx)` with `result.get(i)` in the for loop.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] addNegabinary(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList();
        int pointer_1 = arr1.length - 1;
        int pointer_2 = arr2.length - 1;

        int carry = 0;
        int current = 0;
        int sum = 0;

        while (pointer_1 >= 0 || pointer_2 >= 0) {

            int a = (pointer_1 >= 0) ? arr1[pointer_1] : 0;
            int b = (pointer_2 >= 0) ? arr2[pointer_2] : 0;
