Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning Process:
1. The code initializes an array with a fixed size of 26, representing the lowercase English alphabets.
2. It then iterates through the characters of the input string 's' and increments the corresponding element in the array based on the ASCII value of the character.
3. The code then checks each element in the array and determines the number of deletions required, such that no two elements have the same value.
4. It does this by iterating through the array and decrementing the value of an element if it is already present in the set of unique values. The number of deletions is increased accordingly.
5. However, there is a bug in the code that will cause incorrect output.

The bug is in this section of code:
```java
while (set.contains(i)) {
    i--;
    ans++;
}
```

Explanation of the bug:
1. The loop is designed to decrement the value of 'i' until it is no longer present in the set.
2. However, the loop condition `set.contains(i)` does not check for the case when 'i' becomes 0 and is no longer present in the set. The loop continues in this case as well, causing incorrect results.
3. This bug can lead to an incorrect count of deletions required.

Fix:
We need to add an additional condition in the loop to break when 'i' becomes 0.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    private int N = 26;

    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        int[] array = new int[N];
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            array[ch - 97]++;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : array) {
            if (i == 0) continue;
            while (set.contains(i) && i != 0) { // Add 'i != 0' as an additional condition in the loop
                i--;
                ans++;
            }
            if (i != 0) {
                set.add(i);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
