Bug type: Arithmetic bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code calculates the average value of each level in a binary tree.
2. It uses a queue to perform a level order traversal and calculates the sum of values at each level.
3. It then calculates the average by dividing the sum by the length of the queue at each level.
4. However, in the line `ans.add(row / (qlen-1))`, there is a subtle bug. It is subtracting 1 from `qlen` instead of just dividing by `qlen`.
5. This bug will cause the calculated averages to be incorrect.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change `ans.add(row / (qlen-1))` to `ans.add(row / qlen)`. This will correctly calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the queue.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>(List.of(root));
        List<Double> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (q.size() > 0) {
            double qlen = q.size(), row = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < qlen; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = q.poll();
                row += curr.val;
                if (curr.left != null) q.offer(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) q.offer(curr.right);
            }
            ans.add(row / qlen);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
