Bug type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
1. The code is using an array `mapper` to store the count-and-say sequences.
2. The array `mapper` has a size of `n + 1`, where `n` is the input value.
3. The initial value for `mapper[1]` is set to "1".
4. The code uses a recursive method `countSay()` to generate the count-and-say sequences.
5. The method checks if the count-and-say sequence for a specific `n` is already present in the `mapper` array, and if it is, it returns the value.
6. If the count-and-say sequence is not present in the `mapper` array, the method recursively calls itself with `n - 1` to generate the previous count-and-say sequence.
7. The method then generates the count-and-say sequence for `n` based on the previous sequence.
8. The generated count-and-say sequence is stored in the `mapper` array at index `n`.

The bug in the code is that the array `mapper` is not initialized correctly, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to access elements.

To fix the bug:
- Initialize the `mapper` array with a size of `n + 1` before setting `mapper[1] = "1"`.
- This will ensure that the array has enough space to store the count-and-say sequences for values from 1 to `n`.
- Also, modify the condition in `countSay()` that checks if `mapper[n - 1]` is not null to simply `mapper[n]` to avoid potential null pointer exceptions.

```java
class Solution {
    public String countSay(int n, String[] mapper) {
        if (mapper[n] != null) return mapper[n];
        else {
            // rest of the code remains the same
        }
    }

    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        String mapper[] = new String[n + 1];
        mapper[1] = "1";
        return countSay(n, mapper);
    }
}
```
