Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning process:

1. The code aims to count the number of prime numbers less than a given integer `n`.
2. The code initializes a boolean array `check` of size `n` to keep track of the primality of numbers.
3. The code then iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive) to determine if each number is prime.
4. For each number `i`, if it is not marked as `true` in `check`, it is considered prime. The count is incremented and all multiples of `i` are marked as `true` in `check`.
5. Finally, the count of prime numbers is returned.

Bug:

In the for loop, the condition should be `i < n` instead of `i <= n`. If the condition is `i <= n`, the loop will continue even when `i` becomes equal to `n`, resulting in an extra iteration.

Fix:

Change the loop condition from `i <= n` to `i < n`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPrimes(int n) {
        boolean check[] = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) { // Fix: Changed "<=" to "<"
            if (check[i] == false) {
                count++;
                for (int j = i; j < n; j += i) {
                    check[j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
