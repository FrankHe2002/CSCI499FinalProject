Bug type: Infinite loop

Reasoning:
1. The code is trying to find the minimum number of flips required to convert the given binary matrix to all zeros.
2. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states of the matrix.
3. The variable `steps` keeps track of the number of steps taken to reach the current state.
4. The initial state of the matrix is converted to a binary representation using the `toBinary()` method.
5. The initial state is added to the queue and marked as visited.
6. While the queue is not empty, the code performs the following steps:
   - Dequeue a state from the queue.
   - If the state is already all zeros (i.e., equal to 0), return the number of steps taken so far.
   - Generate the next possible states by flipping each cell's value and enqueueing the new states if they have not been visited before.
   - Increment the number of steps taken.
7. If the queue becomes empty and we have not found a state with all zeros, return -1 to indicate that it is not possible to reach the target state.

Bug analysis and fix:
1. The bug in the code is that it does not handle visited states correctly, which can lead to an infinite loop. The visited set is used to prevent revisiting the same state, but the current implementation does not handle flipped states correctly.
2. When generating the next state in the `flip()` method, the code uses the XOR operator (`^`) to flip the bits. However, the visited set is based on the binary representation of the matrix, not the flipped state itself. This can lead to revisiting the same state multiple times.
3. To fix the bug, we need to update the `flip()` method to use the flipped state itself when checking for visited states.
4. We can modify the `flip()` method to return both the flipped state and the binary representation of the flipped state as a pair.
5. We can use this pair as the key in the visited set instead of just the binary representation.

Here is the modified code with the bug fix applied:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int[][] mat) {
        int m = mat.length, n = mat[0].length;
        Set<Pair<Integer, Integer>> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<Pair<Integer, Integer>> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int steps = 0;

        int initialState = toBinary
