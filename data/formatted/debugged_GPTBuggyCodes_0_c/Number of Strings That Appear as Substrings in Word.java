Bug type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning process:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches the length of `patterns` array.
2. The condition in the loop is incorrect because it uses `<=` instead of `<`. As a result, the loop will also iterate when `i` equals the length of `patterns` array.
3. When `i` equals the length of `patterns` array, `patterns[i]` will try to access an index that is out of bounds, causing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:
1. Change the condition in the loop from `<=` to `<`. This will ensure that the loop only iterates until `i` is less than the length of `patterns` array.
2. Move the code to increment `count` into the if statement to only increment it when `word` contains `patterns[i]`, avoiding unnecessary increments when `word` does not contain the pattern.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfStrings(String[] patterns, String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < patterns.length; i++) {
            if (word.contains(patterns[i])) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
