Bug type: Infinite loop

Reasoning process:
1. The code is implementing a function called `pow` which calculates the value of `base` raised to the power of `exp`.
2. The code uses bitwise operations to check if the current bit of `exp` is 1 and then multiplies `ans` by `base`.
3. After each iteration, the code left shifts `exp` by 1 to divide it by 2.
4. The loop continues until `exp` becomes 0.
5. However, there is a subtle bug in the left shift operation.

Bug fix:
The bug is caused by the incorrect left shift operation on line 10 (`exp <<= 1;`). The correct operation should be to decrement `exp` by 1 (`exp -= 1;`) to divide it by 2.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    static long pow(long base, long exp) {
        long ans = 1;
        for (; exp != 0; ) {
            if ((exp & 1) == 1) {
                ans *= base;
            }
            base *= base;
            // fixing the bug
            exp -= 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    // rest of the code
}
```
