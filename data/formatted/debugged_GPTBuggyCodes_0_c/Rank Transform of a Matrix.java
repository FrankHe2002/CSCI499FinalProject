Bug type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:
1. The code appears to be performing matrix transformations and ranking based on the values in the matrix.
2. Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that there is an issue with the initialization of the `minX` and `minY` arrays.
3. The arrays are initialized with a length of `m` and `n` respectively, which is correct.
4. However, during the calculation of rank, the code tries to access elements in the `minX` and `minY` arrays using the row and column indices (`x` and `y`).
5. This will cause an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the row or column index exceeds the initialized length of the arrays.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to initialize the `minX` and `minY` arrays with a length of `m+1` and `n+1` respectively. This will allow us to safely access elements using row and column indices ranging from 0 to `m` and 0 to `n` respectively.

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int[] xy = {i, j};

                if (map.get(val) == null)
