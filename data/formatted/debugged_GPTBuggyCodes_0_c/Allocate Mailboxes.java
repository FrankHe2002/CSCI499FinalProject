Bug type: Off-by-one error

Reasoning:
1. The code is using dynamic programming to solve the problem.
2. It initializes an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the optimal distance for houses[0...i].
3. The first loop iterates from 1 to n-1 (where n is the number of houses) to fill in `dp` array.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the optimal distance by adding houses[i] - houses[i/2] to the optimal distance of houses[0...(i-1)].
   - The value houses[i] - houses[i/2] represents the distance between houses[i] and the middle house among houses[0...i].
   - It fills `dp[i]` with this total distance.
4. The second loop is used to find the overall optimal distance for k-1 splits.
   - It iterates k-1 times.
   - In each iteration, it creates a new array `next` to store the updated optimal distances.
   - It initializes `next` with Integer.MAX_VALUE.
   - It then iterates over all houses and calculates the optimal distance for each house by considering different splits.
   - It finds the minimum optimal distance and updates `next`.
   - Finally, it updates `dp` array with `next`.
5. The code returns `dp[n-1] + 1`, which represents the overall optimal distance for k splits.

The identified bug is on line 23, where `next[j]` is updated. Inside the loop, the value `sum` is calculated, which represents the total distance between the middle house of houses[0...j] and houses[j]. The loop calculates this distance for different splits and updates `next[j]` to the minimum optimal distance. However, the current code uses the value of `m` incorrectly when updating `next[j]`. It checks if `m == 0`, but it should check if `m == 1` because `m = 0` represents the start of the houses array, not the middle house.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition from `m == 0` to `m == 1` in line 23.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(int[] houses, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(houses);
        int n = houses.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        for (int i
