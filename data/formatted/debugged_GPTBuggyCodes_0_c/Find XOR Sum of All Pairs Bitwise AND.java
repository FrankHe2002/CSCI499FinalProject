Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning process:
1. We need to compute the XOR sum of the arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.
2. The code uses two loops to iterate over the elements of the arrays and compute the XOR sum.
3. In the first loop, `xorSumX` is calculated as the XOR of all elements in the larger array (`x`).
4. In the second loop, `answer` is calculated as the XOR of each element in the smaller array (`y`) and `xorSumX`.
5. The code returns the final `answer`.

The bug in this code is a logic error. The XOR sum should be computed on the elements from both arrays, not just the smaller one. Currently, it only calculates the XOR sum of the elements in the larger array and excludes the elements in the smaller array from the calculation. This is incorrect and will not produce the correct result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to compute the XOR sum of all elements in both arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`).

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {

    public int getXORSum(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int xorSum = 0;
        for (int xi : arr1) {
            xorSum ^= xi;
        }
        for (int xj : arr2) {
            xorSum ^= xj;
        }
        return xorSum;
    }

}
```

In the fixed code, the XOR sum is calculated by iterating over both arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) and applying the XOR operation on each element. The final XOR sum is then returned.
