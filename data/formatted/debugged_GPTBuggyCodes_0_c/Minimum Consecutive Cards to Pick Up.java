The bug in the provided code is a logical error that can cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. 

The issue is with the for loop condition `i <= cards.length`. The loop should iterate over each element in the `cards` array, but using `i <= cards.length` will cause the loop to try to access an index that is out of bounds.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to `i < cards.length`. This will ensure that `i` only iterates up to the last valid index of the `cards` array.

Here is the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumCardPickup(int[] cards) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) { // Fixed the condition to i < cards.length
            if (map.containsKey(cards[i]))
                min = Math.min(i - map.get(cards[i]) + 1, min); // Check if the difference in indices is smaller than minimum
            map.put(cards[i], i); // Update the last found index of the card
        }
        return min == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? - 1 : min; // Repetition found or not
    }
}
```
