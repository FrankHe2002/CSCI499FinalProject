Bug type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all the boxes to a particular position.
2. It uses two nested loops to iterate over the boxes and calculate the operations.
3. In the inner loop, the code tries to access the character at index `j` in the `boxes` string.
4. The loop condition for the inner loop is `j < n + 1`, which means it will iterate from 0 to n (inclusive).
5. However, in the loop body, the code tries to access the character at index `j`, which can be out of bounds for valid indices of `boxes`.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, the valid indices for `boxes` are 0-4. But the code can try to access index 5, which will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Fix:
1. To fix the bug, the loop condition for the inner loop should be `j < n` instead of `j < n + 1`.
2. This will ensure that the loop iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), which are the valid indices for `boxes`.
