Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Bug Reasoning:
1. The code is looping through the characters of the string and checking if each character is a digit.
2. If a digit is found, the code is supposed to shift the character at index (i - 1) by the value of the digit.
3. However, there is a bug in the code where it uses str[i - 1] without checking if i - 1 is a valid index.

Bug Fix:
1. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that i - 1 is a valid index before using it.
2. To do this, we can modify the for loop to start from index 1 instead of 0, and increment by 2 each time.
3. This will ensure that i - 1 is always a valid index.
4. Additionally, we need to handle the case when i = 0, since i - 1 would be -1 which is not a valid index.
5. We can add an if condition to skip the iteration when i = 0.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 43.86%) | Memory: 42.6 MB (Top 27.39%)
class Solution {
    public String replaceDigits(String s) {
        char[] str = s.toCharArray();

        for (int i = 1; i < str.length; i += 2) { // Increment by 2 and start from index 1
            if (i == 0) // Skip iteration when i = 0
                continue;
            if (Character.isDigit(str[i])) {
                str[i] = shift(str[i - 1], str[i]);
            }
        }
        return String.valueOf(str);
    }

    char shift(char letter, char number) {
        int a = Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(number));
        int asci = (int) letter;
        char c = (char) (asci + a);
        return c;
    }
}
```
