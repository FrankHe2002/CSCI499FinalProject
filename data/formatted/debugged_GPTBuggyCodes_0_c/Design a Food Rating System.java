The code appears to have a bug in the constructor's lambda expression used to compare elements in the TreeSet. 

Currently, the lambda expression is: `(a, b) -> foodToRat.get(b).equals(foodToRat.get(a)) ? a.compareTo(b) : foodToRat.get(b) - foodToRat.get(a)`

To identify the bug type, we need to understand the purpose of this lambda expression. It is used to sort the food items in descending order of their ratings (the higher the rating, the earlier in the sorted set it appears). If two food items have the same rating, the items should be sorted in lexicographically increasing order. 

However, the current lambda expression does not handle the case when the ratings of two food items are the same. In this case, it tries to compare the food items using `a.compareTo(b)`, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, we can update the lambda expression to handle this case correctly. We can modify the lambda expression to compare ratings first and then compare the food items lexicographically if the ratings are the same.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
class FoodRatings {
    HashMap<String, TreeSet<String>> cuiToFood = new HashMap();
    HashMap<String, Integer> foodToRat = new HashMap();
    HashMap<String, String> foodToCui = new HashMap();

    public FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings) {
        for (int i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
            TreeSet<String> foodOfThisCuisine = cuiToFood.getOrDefault(cuisines[i], new TreeSet<String>((a, b) -> {
                int ratingComparison = Integer.compare(foodToRat.get(b), foodToRat.get(a));
                if (ratingComparison != 0) {
                    return ratingComparison;
                } else {
                    return a.compareTo(b);
                }
            }));

            foodToRat.put(foods[i], ratings[i]);
            foodOfThisCuisine.add(foods[i]);
            foodToCui.put(foods[i], cuisines[i]);

            cuiToFood.put(cuisines[i], foodOfThisCuisine);
        }
    }

    public void changeRating(String food, int newRating) {
        String cui = foodToCui.get(food);
        TreeSet<String> foodOfThisCui = cuiToFood.get(cui);
        foodOfThisCui.remove(food);
        food
