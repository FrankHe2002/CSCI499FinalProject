Bug type: Logical bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code starts by initializing a list, `list`, to store the smaller side of each rectangle.
2. It also initializes two variables, `max` and `count`, to keep track of the maximum value and the count of rectangles that have a smaller side different from the maximum value.
3. The code then iterates through each rectangle in the given 2D array, `rectangles`.
4. For each rectangle, it checks if the first side (`rectangles[i][0]`) is greater than the second side (`rectangles[i][1]`).
5. If the first side is greater, it adds the second side to the list and updates `max` if necessary. Otherwise, it adds the first side to the list and updates `max` if necessary.
6. After iterating through all rectangles, the code then iterates through each element, `i`, in the list.
7. For each element, it checks if `i` is not equal to `max` and increments `count` if they are not equal.
8. Finally, it returns the value of `count`.

Bug fix:
The bug in the code lies in the comparison `if (i != max)` in the second `for` loop. This condition checks if each element, `i`, in the list is not equal to `max`. However, the correct condition should be `if (i == max)` since we want to count the rectangles that have a smaller side equal to the maximum value, not different from it.

Here is the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countGoodRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
        List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();
        int max = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rectangles.length; i++) {
            if (rectangles[i][0] > rectangles[i][1]) {
                list.add(rectangles[i][1]);
                if (max < rectangles[i][1])
                    max = rectangles[i][1];
            } else {
                list.add(rectangles[i][0]);
                if (max < rectangles[i][0])
                    max = rectangles[i][0];
            }
        }
        for (Integer i : list) {
            if (i == max)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
