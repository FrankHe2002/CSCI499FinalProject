The code appears to have a logic bug. It does not correctly calculate the number of boomerangs.

In the current implementation, the code loops through each point (p) and then calculates the distance between that point (i) and all other points (q). It then stores the distances in a HashMap (hm) where the key is the distance and the value is the number of occurrences of that distance.

After calculating the distances and storing them in the HashMap, the code loops through the HashMap to count the number of boomerangs. If the occurrence of a distance is greater than 1, it calculates the number of boomerangs as (occ * (occ - 1)) and adds it to the answer.

However, the implementation is incorrect because it considers the order of points while calculating the number of boomerangs. It counts the number of permutations of points at the same distance, rather than combinations.

To fix the bug, we need to calculate the number of combinations rather than permutations. We can use the formula n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the number of occurrences of a distance and r is 2 (because we need to choose 2 points to form a boomerang).

Here's the modified code that fixes the bug:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int numberOfBoomerangs(int[][] points) {
        int answer = 0;

        for (int p = 0; p < points.length; p++) {
            int[] i = points[p];
            HashMap<Double, Integer> hm = new HashMap<Double, Integer>();

            for (int q = 0; q < points.length; q++) {
                if (q == p) {
                    continue;
                }
                int[] j = points[q];
                double distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(j[0] - i[0], 2) + Math.pow(j[1] - i[1], 2));

                if (hm.containsKey(distance)) {
                    hm.put(distance, hm.get(distance) + 1);
                } else {
                    hm.put(distance, 1);
                }
            }

            for (int count : hm.values()) {
                answer += count * (count - 1); // Calculate combinations
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
```

In the modified code, we removed the check for `distance > 0` because in calculating combinations, the order of points does not matter. Therefore, we consider distances of
