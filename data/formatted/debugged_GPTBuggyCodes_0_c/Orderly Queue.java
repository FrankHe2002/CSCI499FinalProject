Bug type: String Index Out of Bounds Exception 

Explanation:
The bug is in the line:
```java
s += s.substring(0, n-1);
```
Here, it is trying to concatenate the string 's' with a substring of itself starting from index 0 to n-1. However, the substring method in Java is exclusive of the end index. So, when n is equal to the length of 's', the substring method is called with arguments (0, n-1), which will try to access the character at index (n-1) in the string 's'. But since strings are 0-indexed, the valid indices for 's' are from 0 to n-1. So, this line will throw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when n is equal to the length of 's' because it is trying to access an invalid index.

To fix this bug, we need to change the line:
```java
s += s.substring(0, n-1);
```
to:
```java
s += s.substring(0, n);
```
This change will ensure that the substring includes all the characters of 's'.

Updated code:

```java
// Time O(n)
// Space O(n)
class Solution {
    public String orderlyQueue(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        String ans = "";
        if (k == 1) {
            s += s.substring(0, n); // add itself without the last character
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                if (ans.isEmpty() || s.substring(i, i + n).compareTo(ans) < 0) {
                    ans = s.substring(i, i + n);
                }
        } else {
            char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(arr);
            ans = String.valueOf(arr);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
