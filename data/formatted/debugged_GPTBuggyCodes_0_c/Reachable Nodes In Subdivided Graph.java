Bug Type: Incorrect Condition Check

Reasoning Process:
1. The code is trying to calculate the number of reachable nodes within a given number of maxMoves.
2. It uses a priority queue (heap) to keep track of the nodes to be visited.
3. It iterates over the priority queue until it is empty.
4. In each iteration, it takes the nearest node from the priority queue, marks it as visited, and increments the counter.
5. Then, it checks for neighboring nodes and adds them to the priority queue if they are not visited and can be reached within the remaining maxMoves.
6. Finally, it returns the counter.

The bug can be identified by analyzing the condition check in the inner loop:
```java
if (vis[i] && maxMovesRemaining >= graph[nearestNodeId][i] + 1)
```
The condition is checking if the node i is already visited (`vis[i] == true`) and if the maximum moves remaining is greater than or equal to the distance from the nearest node to node i (`maxMovesRemaining >= graph[nearestNodeId][i] + 1`).
However, the intended condition should be the opposite - it should check if the node is NOT visited. The bug was introduced by reversing the condition check, which will prevent adding the unvisited neighboring nodes to the priority queue.

To fix the bug, the condition check should be changed to:
```java
if (!vis[i] && maxMovesRemaining >= graph[nearestNodeId][i] + 1)
```
This will correctly add the neighboring nodes that are not visited and can be reached within the remaining maxMoves.

Code with the bug fix applied:
```java
class Solution {
    public int reachableNodes(int[][] edges, int maxMoves, int n) {
        int[][] graph = new int[n][n];
        for (int[] t : graph) {
            Arrays.fill(t, - 1);
        }
        for (int[] t : edges) {
            graph[t[0]][t[1]] = t[2];
            graph[t[1]][t[0]] = t[2];
        }
        PriorityQueue<int[]> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        int ans = 0;
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[n];
        heap.offer(new int[] {0, maxMoves});
        while (! heap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] info = heap.poll();
            int nearestNodeId = info[0
