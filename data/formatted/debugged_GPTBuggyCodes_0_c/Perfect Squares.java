Bug type: IndexOutOfBoundsBug

Reasoning process:
1. The code is implementing dynamic programming to solve the "perfect squares" problem.
2. The function `numSquares` initializes an ArrayList `perfect_squares` to store all the perfect squares less than or equal to `n`.
3. Then, it creates a 2D array `dp` to store previously calculated results, with dimensions `[n + 1][perfect_squares.size() + 1]`.
4. Finally, it calls the helper function `helper` to calculate the answer using recursion with memoization.

First, let's analyze the helper function:
1. The function takes four parameters: `n` (the number to be decomposed into perfect squares), `coins` (the list of perfect squares), `i` (the current index of the `coins` list), and `dp` (the memoization array).
2. If `n` is equal to 0, it means we have successfully decomposed `n` into perfect squares, so we return 0.
3. If `i` is less than or equal to 0, it means we have exhausted all the perfect squares in the `coins` list, and we haven't been able to decompose `n` into perfect squares. In this case, we return a very large value 999999 to indicate it's not possible.
4. If the result for this `n` and `i` has already been calculated and stored in the `dp` array, we return the stored result.
5. The function then calculates the answer recursively by considering two options: not taking the current perfect square (`nottake = helper(n, coins, i - 1, dp)`), or taking the current perfect square (`take = 1 + helper(n - coins.get(i-1), coins, i-1, dp)`).
6. The function stores the minimum value between `nottake` and `take` in the `dp` array and returns it.

Now, let's identify the bug:

In the main function `numSquares`, the while loop is responsible for populating the `perfect_squares` list with all the perfect squares less than or equal to `n`. The loop condition is `i * i <= n`, which will include `i * i = n` as a valid perfect square. However, the bug is that the `dp` array is created using `perfect_squares.size() + 1` as the number of
