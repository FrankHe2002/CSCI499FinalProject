Bug Type: Canonicalization Bug

Reasoning:
1. The program calculates the number of servings of soup using a recursive function `helper`.
2. The `helper` function takes two parameters `a` and `b`, representing the remaining servings of soup, and a 2D array `dp`.
3. The function recursively calculates the number of servings of soup by considering different combinations of servings of soup that can be consumed by person A and person B.
4. The base cases of the recursive function are incorrect. When both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to 0, the function should return 0, not 0.5.
5. Similarly, when `b` is less than or equal to 0, the function should return 0 instead of continuing the recursion.
6. As a result of the incorrect base cases, the calculation of the number of servings of soup is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.
7. The bug introduced in the `main` method is not relevant to the logic of the program and does not affect the result.

Fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public double soupServings(int n) {
        if (n > 4800) return 1;
        n = (int) Math.ceil(n * 1.0 / 25);
        double dp[][] = new double[n + 1][n + 1];
        return helper(n, n, dp);
    }

    double helper(int a, int b, double dp[][]) {
        if (a <= 0 && b <= 0) return 0; // Fix: Changed return value to 0
        if (b <= 0) return 0; // Fix: Changed return value to 0
        if (a <= 0) return 1;
        if (dp[a][b] > 0) return dp[a][b];
        return dp[a][b] = 0.25 * (helper(a - 4, b, dp) + helper(a - 3, b - 1, dp) + helper(a - 2, b - 2, dp) + helper(a - 1, b - 3, dp));
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.soupServings(50));
    }
}
```

The fixed code includes changes to the `helper` function to correct the base cases and return the correct
