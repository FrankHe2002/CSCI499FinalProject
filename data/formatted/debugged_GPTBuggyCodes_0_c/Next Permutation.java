Bug type: Assignment bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code is trying to find the next permutation of the given array.
2. It goes through the array from the end, finds the first element (nextOfPeak) that is smaller than the next element.
3. If no such element is found, it means the array is in decreasing order, so it reverses the array and returns.
4. If the nextOfPeak is found, it tries to find the element greater than nextOfPeak.
5. It then swaps nextOfPeak with the found element and reverses the remaining elements in the array.

Bug identification:
In the code, when swapping nextOfPeak with nextOfPeak, there is a bug. It assigns nums[nextOfPeak] to nums[nextOfPeak], which doesn't change the value and doesn't perform the swap correctly.

Fix:
Change the line `nums[nextOfPeak] = nums[nextOfPeak];` to `nums[nextOfPeak] = nums[reversalPoint];` to correctly perform the swap.

    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        // FIND peek+1
        int nextOfPeak = -1;
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                nextOfPeak = i - 1;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Return reverse Array
        if (nextOfPeak == -1) {
            int start = 0;
            int end = nums.length - 1;
            while (start <= end) {
                int temp = nums[start];
                nums[start] = nums[end];
                nums[end] = temp;
                start++;
