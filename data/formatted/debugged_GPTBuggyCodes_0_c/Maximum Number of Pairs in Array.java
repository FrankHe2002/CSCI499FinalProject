Bug Type: The code contains a logic error that incorrectly counts the pairs.

Reasoning Process:
1. The code uses a HashSet to keep track of unique elements encountered.
2. When iterating over each element in the array, if the element is not in the set, it is added to the set.
3. If the element is already in the set, the code incorrectly adds it to the set again and increments the pairs count.

This logic is incorrect because the HashSet is only supposed to store unique elements. By adding the element again, the count of pairs is being incremented even though the element is not a new pair.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the incorrect line that adds the element again to the set when a pair is found. We also need to fix the calculation of the number of pairs by dividing it by 2, as each pair is currently counted twice.

Here is the corrected code:
```java
// Runtime: 3 ms (Top 69.59%) | Memory: 42.4 MB (Top 82.22%)
class Solution {
    public int[] numberOfPairs(int[] nums) {

        if (nums.length == 1)
            return new int[] {0, 1};

        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        int pairs = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (! set.contains(i)) {
                set.add(i); // No pair present
            } else {
                pairs++;
            }
        }

        return new int[] {pairs / 2, set.size()};
    }
}
```
