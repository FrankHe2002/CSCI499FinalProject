Bug type: Logic error

Reasoning:

1. The code uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `p` and `q` by 2 until either `p` or `q` becomes odd.
2. While doing so, it introduces a bug by left shifting `p` by 1 instead of right shifting it.
3. This causes `p` to be multiplied by 2 instead of divided by 2.
4. The bug can be identified by the fact that the code does not actually make `p` become odd.
5. As a result, the calculations in the return statement at the end of the method may not be correct.

Fix:

To fix the bug:

1. Replace the line `p <<= 1;` with `q <<= 1;`. This will correctly divide `q` by 2 in each iteration.
2. This will ensure that `p` and `q` become odd when the loop terminates, allowing the return statement to calculate the correct result.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        while (p % 2 == 0 && q % 2 == 0) {
            p >>= 1;
            q >>= 1;
            q <<= 1; // Fixed bug - right shift instead of left shift
        }
        return 1 - p % 2 + q % 2;
    }
}
```
