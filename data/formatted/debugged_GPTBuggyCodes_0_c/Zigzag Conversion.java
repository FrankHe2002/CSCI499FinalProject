Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is intended to convert a given string in "zigzag" pattern based on the number of numRows.
2. The initial check is correct - if numRows is 1, return the string as it is.
3. A StringBuilder object is created to build the converted string.
4. There is a for loop that loops from 1 to numRows, which is correct.
5. However, the increment/decrement statement in the for loop is incorrect. It should be i++, not i--.
6. Inside the for loop, there is a while loop that appends characters from the string to the builder object based on certain conditions.
   a. If i is equal to 1, it means we are in the first row. In this case, the increment should be ind += 2 * (numRows - i).
   b. If i is equal to numRows, it means we are in the last row. In this case, the increment should be ind += 2 * (i - 1).
   c. For all other rows, the increment alternates between ind += 2 * (numRows - i) and ind += 2 * (i - 1), based on the "up" boolean variable which alternates between true and false.
7. The final converted string is returned.

Bug Fix:
- Update the for loop increment statement from i-- to i++.
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= numRows; i++) {
```
- No other changes are required.
