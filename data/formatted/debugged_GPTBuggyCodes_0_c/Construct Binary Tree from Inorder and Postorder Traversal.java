Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds Exception

Reasoning: 
1. The code defines two instance variables `io` and `po` to store the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, respectively. These arrays are passed as parameters to the `buildTree` method.
2. The `buildTree` method is a recursive function that constructs a binary tree using the given inorder and postorder traversals.
3. The method takes two parameters: `low` and `high`, which represent the range of indices in the `io` and `po` arrays that need to be considered for constructing the subtree.
4. The base case for the recursion is when `n < 0` or `low > high`, which means there are no more nodes to consider.
5. Inside the method, the current node to be constructed is determined using `po[n--]`, where `n` is the index of the next node in the postorder traversal.
6. The index of the current node in the inorder traversal is found using a while loop that increments `idxInInorder` until `io[idxInInorder]` is equal to `currNode`.
7. The left and right subtrees of the current node are recursively constructed using the `buildTree` method by passing appropriate ranges of indices.
8. The constructed node is returned as the root of the current subtree.

The bug in the code is an Array Index Out of Bounds Exception that occurs in the line `int currNode = po[n--];`. The variable `n` is initialized with `inorder.length - 1`, but it is decremented at each recursive call of `buildTree`, causing it to go out of bounds.

To fix this bug, we need to pass `n` as a parameter to the recursive `buildTree` method so that its value is maintained correctly throughout the recursion. Additionally, we need to pass the `n` parameter when making recursive calls to the `buildTree` method for constructing the left and right subtrees.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int[] io;
    int[] po;

    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] inorder, int[] postorder) {
        if (inorder == null || postorder == null || inorder.length == 0 || postorder.length == 0 || inorder.length != postorder.length) {
            return null;
        }
        this.io = inorder;
        this.po = postorder;
        int n = inorder.length -
