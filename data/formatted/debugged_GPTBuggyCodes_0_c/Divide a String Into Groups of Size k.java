Bug Type: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Reasoning:
- The bug occurs in the for loop where the sub-strings of length 'k' are generated.
- The initial condition of the loop is incorrect because it should be "i < s.length()" instead of "i <= s.length()". Since the indices are zero-based, accessing the element at index 's.length()' will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Fix:
- Change the condition in the for loop to "i < s.length()".
