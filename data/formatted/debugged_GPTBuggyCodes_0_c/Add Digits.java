Bug type: Calculation Error

Reasoning process:
- The `addDigits` method is supposed to return the digital root of the given number.
- According to the algorithm, if the number is divisible by 9, the digital root is 9.
- However, the original code is returning `num % 8` instead of `num % 9` when the number is not divisible by 9.
- This is incorrect because the possible remainders when dividing a number by 9 are 0 to 8, not 0 to 7.

Fix:
Change `num % 8` to `num % 9`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        else if (num % 9 == 0) return 9;
        else return num % 9;
    }
}
```
