Bug Type: Off-by-one Error

Explanation:
There is an off-by-one error in the code where the variable `idx` is set to `(nums.length) / 2`. The correct index for the median of a sorted array with odd length should be `(nums.length - 1) / 2`. Subtracting one from the denominator will properly calculate the index of the median element.

To fix this bug, change the following line of code:

```java
int idx = (nums.length) / 2; // introducing bug by subtracting 1 from denominator
```

to:

```java
int idx = (nums.length - 1) / 2;
```

With this change, the code will correctly calculate the index of the median element and give the expected result. 

Here's the updated code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int idx = (nums.length - 1) / 2;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[idx]);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
