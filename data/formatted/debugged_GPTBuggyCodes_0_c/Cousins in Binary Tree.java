Bug Type: Logical Error

The bug in the provided code is a logical error in the return statement. 

To identify and fix the bug, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a set `parentSet` to keep track of the parents of the nodes `x` and `y`.
2. Create a queue `q` and add the root node to it.
3. Start a while loop to process each level of the tree until the queue is empty.
4. Get the number of nodes at the current level by getting the size of the queue.
5. Iterate over each node in the queue:
    - Remove the node from the queue and assign it to the variable `parent`.
    - Check if the left or right child of the `parent` node is not null.
    - If the child is not null, add it to the queue.
    - Check if the value of the child node is equal to `x` or `y`.
    - If it is equal to either `x` or `y`, add the parent node to the `parentSet`.
6. After processing all the nodes at the current level, check if the size of `parentSet` is greater than 0.
7. If it is, return `parentSet.size() == 3` (changed from `2` to `3`), as we need to check if both nodes `x` and `y` have different parents.
8. If the while loop finishes without returning, it means we have processed all the levels of the tree and did not find nodes `x` and `y` with different parents. In this case, return `false`.

Here's the fixed code with minimal changes:

```java
// Runtime: 2 ms (Top 20.27%) | Memory: 42 MB (Top 40.06%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isCousins(TreeNode root, int x, int y) {
        Set<TreeNode> parentSet = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int len = q.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                TreeNode parent = q.remove();

                for (TreeNode child : new TreeNode[]{parent.left, parent.right}) {
                    if (child != null) {
                        q.add(child);
                        if (child.val == x || child.val == y)
                            parentSet.add(parent);
                    }
                }
            }
