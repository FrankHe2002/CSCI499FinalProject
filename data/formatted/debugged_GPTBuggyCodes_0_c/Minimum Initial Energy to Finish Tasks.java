Bug type: Logic bug

Reasoning process:
1. The code sorts the tasks array based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each task.
2. It then calculates the sum of the first element of each task and adds it to the current sum.
3. It also calculates the maximum effort required by comparing the current max with the sum plus the second element of the current task.

The bug:
The bug occurs when calculating the sum. The code is incorrectly adding 1 to the sum.

The fix:
To fix the bug, remove the "+ 1" in the line `sum += tasks[i][0] + 1;`.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumEffort(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                return (b[1] - b[0]) - (a[1] - a[0]);
            }
        });
        int sum = 0, max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, sum + tasks[i][1]);
            sum += tasks[i][0];
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
