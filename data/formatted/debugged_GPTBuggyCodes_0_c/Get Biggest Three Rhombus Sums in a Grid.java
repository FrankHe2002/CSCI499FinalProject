Bug Type: Logic Error

Reasoning:
1. The `searchBigThree` method is called in the `getBiggestThree` method to search for rhombus shapes in the grid and update the `maxThree` array with the largest three sums found.
2. The `addToMaxThree` method is called in the `searchBigThree` method to add a sum to the `maxThree` array if it is larger than the current smallest value in the array.
3. In the `addToMaxThree` method, the condition `maxThree[0] < num` is used to check if the sum should be added to the array. However, this condition may be incorrect because it only checks if the sum is larger than the first value in the array, without considering the other two values.
4. This bug can be fixed by changing the condition to `num > maxThree[2]`, which checks if the sum is larger than the smallest value in the array.

To fix the bug, change the condition in the `addToMaxThree` method:

```java
void addToMaxThree(int[] maxThree, int num) {
    // Do not add duplicate entry
    if (maxThree[0] == num || maxThree[1] == num || maxThree[2] == num) {
        return;
    }

    Arrays.sort(maxThree);

    if (num > maxThree[2]) {
        maxThree[2] = num;
    }
}
```

This change ensures that the sum is correctly added to the `maxThree` array if it is larger than the smallest value.
