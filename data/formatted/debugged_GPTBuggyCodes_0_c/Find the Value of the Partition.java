Bug Type: Incorrect Math function

Reasoning Process:
1. The code is trying to find the maximum difference between two adjacent numbers in an array of integers.
2. The code starts by initializing the `ans` variable as the maximum possible integer value.
3. It then sorts the array in ascending order.
4. The code then iterates through the array, calculating the difference between each number and the next number, and updating the `ans` variable with the maximum difference found so far.
5. However, the bug in the code is that it uses the `Math.max` function instead of the correct `Math.min` function to update the `ans` variable.
6. Using the `Math.max` function will always result in the maximum difference being chosen, which is incorrect for finding the smallest difference.
7. Therefore, the fix for the bug is to change the `Math.max` function to `Math.min` function.

Fixed Code:
```java
// Runtime: 20 ms (Top 50.3%) | Memory: 54.68 MB (Top 33.2%)

class Solution {
    public int findValueOfPartition(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length, ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        for (var i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
            ans = Math.min(ans, nums[i + 1] - nums[i]); // Fixed bug: changed Math.max to Math.min

        return ans;
    }
}
```
