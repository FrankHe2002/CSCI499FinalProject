Bug type: Index out of bounds

Explanation: 

1. In the first loop, the variable `firstLast` is incremented until it reaches `arr.length - 1` or until the condition `arr[firstLast] > arr[firstLast + 1]` is true. 
2. In the second loop, the variable `lastFirst` is decremented until it reaches 0 or until the condition `arr[lastFirst] < arr[lastFirst - 1]` is true. 
3. The length of the shortest subarray is calculated using the variables `firstLast` and `lastFirst`, but there is a subtle bug in the subsequent nested loop that causes an index out of bounds error. 

In the nested loop, the loop variable `i` is initialized as `lastFirst` and incremented until `i` is less than `arr.length - 1`. This is done to find the position in the array where the element at `firstLast` is greater than or equal to the element at `i`. However, the loop condition should be `i < arr.length` instead of `i < arr.length - 1`. 

To fix the bug, the loop condition in the nested loop should be changed to `i < arr.length`.

Here is the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfShortestSubarray(int[] arr) {
        int firstLast = 0, lastFirst = arr.length - 1;
        for (; firstLast < arr.length - 1; firstLast++) {
            if (arr[firstLast] > arr[firstLast + 1]) break;
        }
        //Base case for a non-decreasing sequence
        if (firstLast == arr.length - 1) return 0;
        for (; lastFirst > 0; lastFirst--) {
            if (arr[lastFirst] < arr[lastFirst - 1]) break;
        }
        //Possibilities 1 or 2 as mentioned above
        int minLength = Math.min(arr.length - firstLast - 1, lastFirst);
        for (; firstLast >= 0; firstLast--) {
            for (int i = lastFirst; i < arr.length; i++) { // Fixed loop condition here
                if (arr[firstLast] > arr[i]) continue;
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, i - firstLast - 1);
                break;
            }
        }
        return minLength;
    }
}
```
