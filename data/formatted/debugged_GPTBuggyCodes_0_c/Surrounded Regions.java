The bug in the provided code is that the condition `(i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1)` is missing in the recursive DFS calls. This condition checks if the current cell is on the border of the board. If the current cell is not on the border, it should not be marked as 'T' (temporary value). The absence of this condition causes the algorithm to mark inner 'O' cells as 'T' as well, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to add the same condition `(i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1)` in the recursive DFS calls.

Here is the modified code:

```java
class Solution {
    boolean isClosed = true;

    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        int m = board.length;
        int n = board[0].length;

        // To identify all those O which are adjacent and unbounded by 'X', we put a temporary value
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O' && (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1)) {
                    dfs(board, i, j);
                }
            }
        }

        // revert the temporary value and also replace remaining O with X
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'T') board[i][j] = 'O';
                else if (board[i][j] == 'O') board[i][j] = 'X';
            }
        }

    }

    public void dfs(char[][] board, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= board.length || j >= board[0].length || board[i][j] != 'O') return;

        board[i][j] = 'T'; // to put a temporary mark/ to mark as visited

        if (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == board.length - 1 || j == board[0].length - 1) {
            dfs(board, i, j
