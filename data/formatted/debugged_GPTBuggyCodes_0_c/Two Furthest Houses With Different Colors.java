Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
1. The code initializes variables "l" and "r" to be the left and right indices of the given array "colors", respectively.
2. It then enters a loop that increments "l" until the value at index "l" is not equal to the value at the last index of the array.
3. Similarly, it enters another loop that decrements "r" until the value at index "r" is not equal to the value at the first index of the array.
4. Finally, it returns the maximum value between "r" and "colors.length - l - 1".

The bug lies in the line:
```java
return Math.max(r, colors.length - l - 1);
```
The correct line should be:
```java
return Math.max(r, colors.length - 1 - l);
```
This is because the index of an array starts from 0, so the length of an array should be subtracted by 1 when calculating the difference between the last index and any other index.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] colors) {
        int l = 0, r = colors.length - 1;
        while (colors[colors.length - 1] == colors[l]) l++;
        while (colors[0] == colors[r]) r--;
        return Math.max(r, colors.length - 1 - l); // change "colors.length - l - 1" to "colors.length - 1 - l"
    }
}
```
