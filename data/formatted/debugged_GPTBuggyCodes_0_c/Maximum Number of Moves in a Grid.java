Bug type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
1. The code calculates the maximum number of moves that can be made in a grid.
2. The recursive function `maxMoves` is used to calculate the maximum number of moves starting from a given cell (x, y).
3. The base case for the recursive function is when y == n - 1, which means we have reached the last column. In this case, the function returns 0 since no more moves can be made.
4. The code maintains a 2D dp array to store previously calculated results. Before making a recursive call, it checks if the dp array already contains a value for the current cell. If yes, it returns that value.
5. If the dp array doesn't contain a value for the current cell, the code calculates the maximum number of moves by moving to the adjacent cells in the same row or to the rows above or below.
6. There is a bug in the code in the line `if (grid[x2][y + 1] >= grid[x][y])`. The code is incorrectly accessing `y + 1` instead of `y - 1` to check if the next cell has a greater or equal value compared to the current cell.
7. This bug leads to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when `y` is already at the last column (n - 1).
8. To fix the bug, we need to change `y + 1` to `y - 1` in the line `if (grid[x2][y + 1] >= grid[x][y])`.

class Solution {
    int[][] dp;
    int[] dirs = new int[] {- 1, 0, 1};
    int m, n, max = 0;

    private int maxMoves(int[][] grid, int x, int y) {
        if (y == n - 1) return 0;

        if (dp[x][y] != - 1) return dp[x][y];

        dp[x][y] = 0;
        for (var dir : dirs) {
            var x2 = x + dir;
            if (x2 < 0 || x2 == m) continue;

            if (grid[x2][y - 1] >= grid[x][y])
