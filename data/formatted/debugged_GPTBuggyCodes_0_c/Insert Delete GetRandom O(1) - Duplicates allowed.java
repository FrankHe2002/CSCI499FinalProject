Bug Type: The bug in the provided code is a logic error.

Reasoning Process:

1. The code uses a HashMap `map` to store the integer values as keys and a PriorityQueue as the value for each key to store the indices of the corresponding values in the `multiSet` list. This is done to support constant time inserts, removes and getRandom operations.

2. The issue is with the `remove()` method. When a value is removed, the code updates the indices in the PriorityQueue and the `multiSet` list correctly. However, it fails to update the indices stored in the PriorityQueue for the corresponding value that was swapped with the removed value.

3. Let's consider the following scenario:
   - `multiSet` list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - `map`:
     - 1 -> [0, 3]
     - 2 -> [1]
     - 3 -> [2]
     - 4 -> [4]
     - 5 -> [5]
   - Now, if we remove the value 1, the code swaps it with the value at the last index and removes the last index. The lists become:
     - `multiSet` list: [5, 2, 3, 4]
     - `map`:
       - 1 -> [3] // This should be updated to [0] because 1 is now at index 0
       - 2 -> [1]
       - 3 -> [2]
       - 4 -> [4]
       - 5 -> [5]

4. The bug occurs because the code fails to update the index stored in the PriorityQueue for the value that was swapped with the removed value.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the indices stored in the PriorityQueues for the swapped values. We can do this by retrieving the PriorityQueue for the swapped value and updating the index in it.

Here is the modified code with the fix applied:

```java
class RandomizedCollection {
    List<Integer> multiSet;
    HashMap<Integer, PriorityQueue<Integer>> map;
    Random random;

    public RandomizedCollection() {
        map = new HashMap<>();
        multiSet = new ArrayList<>();
        random = new Random();
    }

    public boolean insert(int val) {
        boolean contains = map.containsKey(val);
        multiSet.add(val);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq;
        if (! contains) {
            pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder
