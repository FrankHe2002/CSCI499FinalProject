Bug Type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:

1. The code initializes an array `li` of type Integer with a length of 26. This array is used to store the index of the last occurrence of each character in the string.
2. The code then starts iterating over the characters of the string, from index 1 to n.
3. For each character, the code calculates the current count of distinct subsequences based on the count from the previous iteration. It also calculates the index of the current character in the `li` array.
4. The code then checks if the `li` array at the current index is null. If it is not null, it subtracts the count at `dp[li[idx] - 1]` from the current count, and takes the result modulo mod.
5. After that, the code updates `dp[i]` with the current count.
6. Finally, the code sets `li[i]` to the current index, which is the subtle bug.

The bug is that `li[i]` should be `li[idx]` instead. This is because each element in the `li` array represents the last occurrence index of a character, not the current index itself.

To fix the bug, replace `li[i] = i;` with `li[idx] = i;`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int distinctSubseqII(String s) {
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        Integer li[] = new Integer[26];
        int n = s.length();
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int curr = (2 * (dp[i - 1] % mod)) % mod;
            int idx = c[i - 1] - 'a';
            if (li[idx] != null) dp[i] = (curr - dp[li[idx] - 1] + mod) % mod;
            else dp[i] = curr;
            li[idx] = i; // Fixed bug: Updated li[idx] instead of li[i]
        }
        return dp[n] - 1;
    }
}
```
