The provided code is a mix of two unrelated code snippets. It seems that there was a mistake when copying the code, resulting in a mixture of two different programs. 

The first part of the code appears to be a solution for the Game of Life problem, where the cells of a matrix are updated based on specific rules. The second part of the code is unrelated and seems to be performing some sort of manipulation on a 2D array.

To fix this issue and focus on the Game of Life problem, we can remove the second part of the code and ensure that only the relevant code for the Game of Life problem is present. 

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        int[][] next = new int[m][n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                next[i][j] = nextState(board, i, j, m, n);
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                board[i][j] = next[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    private int nextState(int[][] board, int row, int col, int m, int n) {
        int count = liveNeighbors(board, row, col, m, n);
        
        if (board[row][col] == 1) {
            if (count < 2 || count > 3) {
                return 0; // Cell dies due to underpopulation or overpopulation
            } else {
                return 1; // Cell survives
            }
        } else {
            if (count == 3) {
                return 1; // Cell reproduces
            } else {
                return 0; // Cell remains dead
            }
        }
    }
    
    private int liveNeighbors(int[][] board, int row, int col, int m, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = row - 1; i <= row + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = col - 1; j <= col + 1; j++) {
                if (i >= 0 && i < m && j >= 0
