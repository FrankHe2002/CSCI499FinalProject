Bug Type: Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning Process:

1. The code initializes an array `dig` of size 4 to hold the individual digits of the input number `num`.
2. The loop `while (num > 0)` extracts each digit from `num` and stores it in the `dig` array. It uses the variable `cur` to keep track of the current index in the `dig` array.
3. The extracted digits are then sorted in ascending order using `Arrays.sort(dig)`.
4. The code then calculates two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, by combining specific digits from the sorted `dig` array.
   - `num1` is formed by taking the first digit `dig[0]` and the fourth digit `dig[3]`.
   - `num2` is formed by taking the second digit `dig[1]` and the third digit `dig[2]`.

Fix:

The bug is that the code mistakenly uses `dig[3]` in the calculation of both `num1` and `num2` instead of using `dig[2]` for `num2`. To fix this, we need to change `dig[3]` to `dig[2]` in the calculation of `num2`.

Updated Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumSum(int num) {
        int[] dig = new int[4]; // For each digit
        int cur = 0;
        while (num > 0) // Getting each digit
        {
            dig[cur++] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        Arrays.sort(dig); // Ascending order
        int num1 = dig[0] * 10 + dig[3]; // 1st and 4th digit
        int num2 = dig[1] * 10 + dig[2]; // 2nd and 3rd digit
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```
