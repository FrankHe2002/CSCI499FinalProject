The bug type in the provided Java code is logic error and incorrect implementation.

The first step in identifying and fixing the bug is to understand the logic implemented in the code. The provided code aims to determine the number of nodes reachable from node 0 in the new graph given an original graph and maxMoves. 

In the original code, the logic for traversing the graph, updating the moves, and counting reachable nodes is incorrect and leads to an incorrect result. 

To fix the bug, the logic of the algorithm needs to be re-implemented by properly traversing the graph while keeping track of the number of reachable nodes.

The final fixed code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int reachableNodes(int[][] edges, int maxMoves, int n) {
        Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.put(i, new HashMap<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).put(edge[1], edge[2]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).put(edge[0], edge[2]);
        }

        int ans = 0;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        heap.offer(new int[] {0, maxMoves});

        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] info = heap.poll();
            int node = info[0];
            int movesRemaining = info[1];
            if (visited[node]) {
                continue; // Skip if node has been visited
            }
            visited[node] = true;
            ans++; // Node is reachable
            Map<Integer, Integer> adjacent = graph.get(node);
            for (int nextNode : adjacent.keySet()) {
                int cnt = adjacent.get(nextNode);
                if (!visited[nextNode] && movesRemaining >= cnt + 1) {
                    heap.offer(new int[] {nextNode, movesRemaining - cnt - 1});
                }
                int movesUsed = Math.min(movesRemaining, cnt);
                ans += movesUsed;
                graph.get(nextNode).put(node, graph.get(nextNode).get(node) - movesUsed);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, the algorithm now uses a `Map` to represent the graph which makes it easier to keep track of the nodes, their neighbours, and edge costs. The algorithm calculates the reachable nodes using a priority queue to perform Dijkstra's algorithm and making the necessary adjustments to the moves used in the traversal. This provides the correct result for identifying the reachable nodes from the initial node in the given graph.
