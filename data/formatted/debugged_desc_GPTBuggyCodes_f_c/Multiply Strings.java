The bug in the provided Java code is in the multiplication and summing process within the multiply function. Currently, the function is performing the arithmetic operation with the integer digits directly, which will not provide the correct result. 

In the provided implementation, we need to multiply the integer digits from `num1` and `num2`, sum the results, and keep track of the carries while constructing the final result. 

Also, it's important to note that in the provided code, there are no checks for constraints about the lengths of the input strings and the numbers they represent, and the use of arrays can be refactored to improve the logic clarity; however, these are not considered as part of the requested minimal changes.

The fixed code will implement the correct multiplication process and the corresponding fix for the missing carry operation.

	Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String multiply(String num1, String num2) {
        if (num1.equals("0") || num2.equals("0"))
            return "0";

        int m = num1.length(), n = num2.length();
        int[] arr = new int[m + n];

        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int carry = 0;
            int column = 0;
            int a = num1.charAt(i) - '0';
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                int b = num2.charAt(j) - '0';
                int temp = (arr[i + j + 1] + a * b + carry);
                arr[i + j + 1] = temp % 10;
                carry = temp / 10;
            }
            arr[i] += carry;
        }
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int digit : arr) {
            if (result.length() == 0 && digit == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            result.append(digit);
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```
