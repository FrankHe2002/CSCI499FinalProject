The identified bug type is Logical Error (number 5).

The code contains a logical error when determining if a given year is a leap year.

The provided code is below:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        if ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 != 0)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

The logical condition for testing leap years is incorrectly implemented. The correct condition for identifying leap years should be if a year is divisible by 4 and not by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400. 

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        if ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

The logical condition for testing leap years has been adjusted to `(year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)`, ensuring the correct identification of leap years, and solving the logical error.
