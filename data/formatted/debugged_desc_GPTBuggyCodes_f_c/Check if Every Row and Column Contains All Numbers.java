The provided buggy Java code, specifically the checkValid method in the Solution class, contains a logical flaw that does not effectively validate if every row and every column in the matrix contains all integers from 1 to n inclusively.

Explanation:
Upon reviewing the original checkValid method, several issues have been identified:
1. The formula num = (n * (n + 1)) / 2 aims to find the sum of integers from 1 to n but is not relevant to the validation of the matrix.
2. The two HashSet objects hs and hs1 are being used inefficiently and result in redundant validation checks in the nested loop, leading to incorrect verification of the rows and columns.
3. The nested loop iterates to sum and store indexes, but the logic is flawed for correctly checking every row and column for the presence of integers 1 to n inclusive.

Fix:
To fix the logical flaw in the checkValid method of the Solution class:
1. The use of HashSet for row and column validations can be substituted with an array, and the nested loop can be altered to accumulate and verify indexes sequentially.
2. The formula to calculate the expected sum of integers from 1 to n for validation is not necessary and should be removed to adhere to the constraints.

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public boolean checkValid(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean[] rowCheck = new boolean[n];
            boolean[] colCheck = new boolean[n];

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] < 1 || matrix[i][j] > n || rowCheck[matrix[i][j] - 1]) {
                    return false;
                }
                rowCheck[matrix[i][j] - 1] = true;

                if (matrix[j][i] < 1 || matrix[j][i] > n || colCheck[matrix[j][i] - 1]) {
                    return false;
                }
                colCheck[matrix[j][i] - 1] = true;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

This fixed code removes the redundant logic and accurately checks for the presence of integers 1 to n in each row and each column of the matrix.
