The bug type in the given Java code is a logical error.

Explanation:
The logic inside the outer loop of the `minOperations` method is incorrect. It tries to calculate the minimum number of operations for each box to move all the balls to that box by attempting to calculate the distances between all pairs of boxes. The inner loop iterates `n + 1` times instead of `n`, and the conditional logic to calculate the minimum number of operations for each box is incorrect.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length();
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        int[] sum = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0, ops = 0, ones = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = ops;
            sum[i] = ones;
            if (boxes.charAt(i) == '1') ones++;
            ops += sum[i];
        }
        for (int i = n - 1, ops = 0, ones = 0; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans[i] += ops;
            ops += sum[i];
            if (boxes.charAt(i) == '1') ones++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
