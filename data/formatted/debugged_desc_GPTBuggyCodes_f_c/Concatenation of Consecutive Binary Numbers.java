The identified bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error.

The reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug involves:
- Understanding the intended behavior based on the code description and constraints.
- Analyzing the actual behavior and comparing it to the intended behavior.
- Identifying code segments that do not align with the intended behavior.
- Applying the necessary adjustments to align the code with the intended behavior.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
        long res = 0;
        long mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            res = (res * (int) Math.pow(2, Integer.toBinaryString(i).length()) + i) % mod;
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, I added a long variable for the modulo value to avoid the magic number and help with code readability. I also fixed the Math.pow() function by removing the addition of 1 from the binary representation. Lastly, I changed the modulo operator to use the newly created long variable, mod.
