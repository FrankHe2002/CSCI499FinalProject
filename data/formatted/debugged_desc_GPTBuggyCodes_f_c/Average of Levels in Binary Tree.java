The bug type in the provided code is a logical error.

The logical error in the given Java code is present in the `averageOfLevels` method. First, the formula to calculate the average of each level is wrong. It should be `row / qlen` instead of `row / (qlen - 1)`. Additionally, the code for adding nodes at each level is not initialized properly, leading to the wrong average calculation.

Below is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>(List.of(root));
        List<Double> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            double qlen = q.size();
            double row = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < qlen; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = q.poll();
                row += curr.val;
                if (curr.left != null) q.offer(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) q.offer(curr.right);
            }
            ans.add(row / qlen);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:
1. Integer `- 1` is removed from `ans.add(row / (qlen - 1))` to `ans.add(row / qlen)` to correctly calculate the average.
2. The condition in the while loop is corrected to `!q.isEmpty()` for checking if the queue is not empty.
3. The default value of `row` variable is set to 0 to indicate the sum of the nodes at each level.
