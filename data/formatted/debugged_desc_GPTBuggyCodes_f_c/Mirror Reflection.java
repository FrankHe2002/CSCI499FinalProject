Explanation:
The code provided is using bitwise operators and regular arithmetic operations to determine which receptor the laser ray will meet first. However, the specific combination of operations does not accurately represent the scenario described.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        int g = gcd(p, q);
        p /= g;
        p %= 2;
        q /= g;
        q %= 2;

        if (p == 1 && q < 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (p == 1 && q == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 2;
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b > 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
