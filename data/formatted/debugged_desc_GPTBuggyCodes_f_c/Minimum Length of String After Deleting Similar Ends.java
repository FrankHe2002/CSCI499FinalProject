The bug in the provided code appears to be in the for loop, specifically in the condition for the while loop for decrementing the `length`.

Additionally, the logic inside the outer while loop could be improved by adding an index boundary check.

The following are the identified issues:

1. The `left` index should not be decremented if the suffix is not of equal characters.
2. The code does not account for the case when there is no non-empty prefix or suffix; in that case, the length of the string should be returned as the output.

The fix for the code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        int length = s.length();
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        for (int left = 0, right = chars.length - 1; left < right; ) {
            if (chars[left] == chars[right]) {
                char c = chars[left];
                int tempLeft = left;
                while (left < right && chars[left] == c) {
                    left++;
                    length--;
                }

                while (right >= left && chars[right] == c) {
                    right--;
                    length--;
                }
                if (tempLeft == left) {
                    // No non-empty prefix or suffix
                    return length;
                }
            } else {
                // If characters don't match, no common prefix or suffix
                break;
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
}
```

The fixed code now accounts for the cases where there is no non-empty prefix or suffix, and it resolves the boundary issues encountered with the original implementation.
