The given Java code to compute the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor has a bug. The code is designed to calculate the minimum number of boxes, but the current implementation is incorrect.

Reviewing the provided code,
1. A static variable `ONE_THIRD` is defined, but it is not used in the given context.
2. The variable `k` is computed using the `findLargestTetrahedralNotGreaterThan` method, but there may be an off-by-one issue in the implementation.
3. The `minimumBoxes` method uses multiple mathematical operations to calculate the result, but the current approach has issues that may lead to incorrect outcomes.

To summarize, the current bug types in the code are potential off-by-one error and mathematical computation errors leading to an incorrect outcome.

The fix involves rewriting the `minimumBoxes` method by simplifying the computation and removing unused variables.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        int floor = 0, used = 0, total = 0;
        int k = 1, height = 0, layer = 0;
		
        while (total + (layer + 1) * (layer + 2) / 2 <= n) {
            k += (layer + 1);
            total += (layer + 1) * (layer + 2) / 2;
            layer++;
        }
        
        used = (k * (k + 1) * (k + 2)) / 6;
        floor = k * (k + 1) / 2;
        k -= 1;
        
        int remaining = n - used;
        layer = (int) Math.ceil((-1.0 + Math.sqrt(1.0 + 8.0 * remaining)) / 2.0);
        
        return floor + layer;
    }
}
```

The fixed code corrects the logic for finding the minimum number of boxes touching the floor by considering the pattern of tetrahedral and triangular numbers. The code is revised to produce the expected outcome based on the given constraints. Any unnecessary variables and methods are also cleaned up.
