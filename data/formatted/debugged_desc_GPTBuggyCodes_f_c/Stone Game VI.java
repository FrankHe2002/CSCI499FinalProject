Bug: Compilation errors due to missing import statements

The code lacks the necessary import statements for certain classes and interfaces used in the code, which results in compilation errors.

Fix:
Add the necessary import statements to resolve the compilation errors:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
```
