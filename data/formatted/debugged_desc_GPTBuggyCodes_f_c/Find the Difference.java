Explanation:
The original code uses the XOR operator to find the added letter, which is a valid approach. However, returning the lowercase of the result ('return Character.toLowerCase(c);') does not align with the problem statement that specifies the input strings consist of lowercase letters. Removing the conversion to lowercase fixes this issue.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for (char cs : s.toCharArray()) c ^= cs;
        for (char ct : t.toCharArray()) c ^= ct;
        return c;
    }
}
```
