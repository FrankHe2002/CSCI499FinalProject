The bug in the provided code is in the indexing of the edges. The index `edge_postion` seems to be 1-indexed rather than 0-indexed for the brick edges, which causes issues in updating the edge frequency. The `max_frequency` should be calculated based on the total count of bricks, not the number of edges. Additionally, the `edge_frequency` map needs to check for `wal.get(row).size() - 2` edges instead of `wall.get(row).size() - 1`. 

To fix this, it is necessary to update the index `edge_postion` and the calculation of `max_frequency`. 

The fixed code looks like:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int leastBricks(List<List<Integer>> wall) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> edge_frequency = new HashMap<>(); 
        int max_frequency = 0;

        for (List<Integer> rowList : wall) {
            int edge_position = 0; 

            for (int brick_no = 0; brick_no < rowList.size() - 1; brick_no++) {
                int current_brick_length = rowList.get(brick_no); 
                edge_position += current_brick_length; 
                edge_frequency.put(edge_position, edge_frequency.getOrDefault(edge_position, 0) + 1); 
                max_frequency = Math.max(edge_frequency.get(edge_position), max_frequency); 
            }
        }
        return wall.size() - max_frequency;
    }
}
```

This fix addresses the indexing and frequency calculation to accurately count the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing a vertical line. 

The updated code now properly establishes the correct edge positions, updates their frequencies, and calculates the maximum frequency of edge positions stored. Then, it calculates the minimum number of crossed bricks and returns the result as required.
