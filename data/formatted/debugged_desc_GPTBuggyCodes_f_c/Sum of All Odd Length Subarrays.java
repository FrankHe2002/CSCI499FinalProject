Explanation:
The original code has a logical error in the nested loop condition and the even length check within the loop. The initial value of `prevSum` starts from the current index `i`, and the loop continues until the end of the array, which fails to ensure an odd-length subarray. Also, the logic for checking odd-length subarrays using the condition `(j - i + 1) % 2 == 1` is incorrect.

The fixed implementation should correctly consider all possible odd-length subarrays in an array and calculate their sum. One way to address this is by reconsidering the logic using a simplified approach to calculate the sum of odd-length subarrays.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOddLengthSubarrays(int[] arr) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int curSum = arr[i];
            sum += curSum;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
                curSum += arr[j];
                if ((j - i + 1) % 2 == 1) {
                    sum += curSum;
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
