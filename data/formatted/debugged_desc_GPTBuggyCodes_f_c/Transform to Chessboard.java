The issue in the provided code lies in the implementation of the movesToChessboard method. The approach taken in this code doesn't align with the requirements and constraints of the given problem. The specified task involves finding the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a chessboard where no 0's and no 1's are 4-directionally adjacent.

It's important to identify and resolve the bug based on the requirements and constraints of the problem. In this instance, the bug is caused by an incorrect approach to solving the problem.

Based on the constraints and the problem description, the correct way to identify and resolve the issue is to build an accurate approach that systematically checks and transforms the board based on the requirements of the chessboard.

The fixed code deals with assigning the board values to align with chessboard requirements and checks to verify that the final board indeed represents a chessboard. This will ensure that no 0's and no 1's are 4-directionally adjacent.

Fixed Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int movesToChessboard(int[][] board) {
        int N = board.length, colToMove = 0, rowToMove = 0, rowOneCnt = 0, colOneCnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                if ((board[0][0] ^ board[i][0] ^ board[i][j] ^ board[0][j]) == 1) {
                    return -1;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            rowOneCnt += board[0][i];
            colOneCnt += board[i][0];
            if (board[i][0] == i % 2) {
                rowToMove++;
            }
            if (board[0][i] == i % 2) {
                colToMove++;
            }
        }
        if (rowOneCnt < N / 2 || rowOneCnt > (N + 1) / 2) {
            return -1;
        }
        if (colOneCnt < N / 2 || colOneCnt > (N + 1) / 2) {
            return -1;
        }
        if (N % 2 == 0) {
            colToMove = Math.min(colToMove, N - colToMove);
            rowToMove = Math.min(rowToMove, N - rowToMove);
        } else {
            if (colToMove % 2 == 1) {
                colToMove = N - colToMove;
            }
            if (rowToMove % 2 == 1) {
                rowToMove = N - rowToMove;
            }
        }
        return (colToMove + rowToMove) / 2;
    }
}
```
