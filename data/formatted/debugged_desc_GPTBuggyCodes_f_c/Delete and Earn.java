Bug: Logical Error

Explanation: The issue in the `deleteAndEarn` function is in the calculation of points based on the given condition. When picking a number to delete it, it is also necessary to consider earning points by deleting every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1. The previous implementation lacks that consideration.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        int max = Arrays.stream(nums)
                .max()
                .orElse(0);
        int[] sum = new int[max + 1];
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum[num] += num;
        }
        int take = 0;
        int skip = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sum.length; i++) {
            int takeI = skip + sum[i];
            int skipI = Math.max(take, skip);
            take = takeI;
            skip = skipI;
        }
        return Math.max(take, skip);
    }
}
```
