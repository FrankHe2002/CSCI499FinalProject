The issue with the provided code is that the largestMerge function does not consistently return the lexicographically largest string that can be constructed. Additionally, the check function seems to be overly complex and does not fully account for comparing the string's lexicographical largest elements. 

In the given code, there are two main problems:
1. The check method does not efficiently check for the lexicographically larger merge.
2. The main while loop structure in the largestMerge method does not consistently choose the lexicographically largest options.

The fix will involve revising the main while loop and the check method to ensure that the method correctly returns the lexicographically largest string based on the given constraints. 

Here's the revised and fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String largestMerge(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while (i < word1.length() && j < word2.length()) {
            if (word1.substring(i).compareTo(word2.substring(j)) > 0) {
                sb.append(word1.charAt(i));
                i++;
            } else {
                sb.append(word2.charAt(j));
                j++;
            }
        }
        sb.append(word1.substring(i));
        sb.append(word2.substring(j));

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we have removed the check method completely and utilized the substring and charAt methods directly to access characters and compare the strings, ensuring that the lexicographically largest merge string is consistently selected. This should resolve the bug in the initial implementation and return the correct result.
