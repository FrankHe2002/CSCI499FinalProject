The given buggy Java code attempts to return the middle node of a given singly linked list. However, there are a couple of issues in the code:

1. The middle node returned is the (size/2)th node, which should be 1 less because of 0-based indexing.
2. If the size of the linked list is even, the second middle node should be returned.

The first issue can be fixed by decrementing the `mid` by 1. To tackle the second issue, we need to move the second pointer twice as fast as the first pointer to find the second middle node.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
}
```
