Explanation:
The while loop in `convertTime` only iterates up to index 2 in the `order` array, which causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Additionally, the order of the time intervals is incorrect, as it should count down from the highest (60 minutes) to the lowest (1 minute). The correct order is therefore {60, 15, 5, 1}, which will work correctly from highest to lowest time intervals.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int HHMMToMinutes(String s) {
        return Integer.parseInt(s.substring(0, 2)) * 60 + Integer.parseInt(s.substring(3, 5));
    }

    public int convertTime(String current, String correct) {
        int diff = HHMMToMinutes(correct) - HHMMToMinutes(current);
        int[] order = {60, 15, 5, 1};
        int ops = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < order.length; i++) {
            ops += (diff / order[i]);
            diff %= order[i];
        }
        return ops;
    }
}
```
