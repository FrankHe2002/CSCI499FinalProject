Explanation:
The `isCousins` method has an issue where it considers any two nodes at the same depth to be cousins if one is a parent of the other. The expected behavior is to check if both nodes are at the same depth and have different parents. The fix involves identifying the parent of the current depth, and then ensuring that both nodes are found with the same parent, meaning they are siblings.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isCousins(TreeNode root, int x, int y) {
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int len = q.size();
            boolean foundX = false, foundY = false;

            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                TreeNode parent = q.remove();

                if (parent.left != null && (parent.left.val == x || parent.left.val == y)) {
                    if (foundX || foundY) {
                        return true; // either x or y child was already found at this level
                    }
                    foundX = true;
                }
                if (parent.right != null && (parent.right.val == x || parent.right.val == y)) {
                    if (foundX || foundY) {
                        return true; // either x or y child was already found at this level
                    }
                    foundY = true;
                }
                if (parent.left != null) {
                    q.add(parent.left);
                }
                if (parent.right != null) {
                    q.add(parent.right);
                }
            }

            if (foundX || foundY) {
                return false; // either x or y was not found at this level
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
