Explanation:
The given code has a logical error. In the while loop, we are only checking for the first and last element to identify the different colors' positions. However, this approach is incorrect. It does not consider the potential case where there can be multiple color repeats within the array. The issue lies in the calculation of the distance, which does not guarantee the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.

Fix:
To fix this, we can use nested loops to identify the different colors' positions and get the maximum distance between them. After identifying the position of different colors, we can calculate the distance and track the maximum distance.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] colors) {
        int maxDistance = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < colors.length; j++) {
                if (colors[i] != colors[j]) {
                    maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, Math.abs(i - j));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxDistance;
    }
}
```
