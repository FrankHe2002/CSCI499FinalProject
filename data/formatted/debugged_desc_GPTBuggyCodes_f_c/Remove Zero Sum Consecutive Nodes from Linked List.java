The provided Java code for the removeZeroSumSublists function is buggy. The code attempts to remove consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 in a linked list, but it doesn't correctly calculate and update the prefix sum and maintain a map of prefix sums and their corresponding ListNode. Here are the identified issues and their fixes:

1. The `seen` HashMap should be updated whenever a new prefix sum is encountered while traversing the linked list.
2. The second iteration of calculating the prefix sum and updating the ListNode pointers is erroneous.

Updated and fixed code for the removeZeroSumSublists function:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode head) {

        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;

        int prefixSum = 0;
        ListNode curr = dummy;
        Map<Integer, ListNode> seen = new HashMap<>();

        while (curr != null) {
            prefixSum += curr.val;
            seen.put(prefixSum, curr);
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        prefixSum = 0;
        curr = dummy;
        while (curr != null) {
            prefixSum += curr.val;
            curr.next = seen.get(prefixSum).next;
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

The changes involve fixing the calculation and updates of the prefix sum as well as the mapping of prefix sums to their corresponding ListNode.

The removed ListNode objects will be automatically garbage collected by the Java Virtual Machine, so there's no need to explicitly deallocate them.
