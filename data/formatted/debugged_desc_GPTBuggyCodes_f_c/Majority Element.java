The bug type in the original code provided is a logical error. The `majorityElement` method doesn't appropriately find the majority element in the given array. It incorrectly sorts the array and determines the value at the middle index as the majority element.

To fix the bug, we must implement a proper algorithm to find the majority element in the array. One such efficient approach is the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which performs this task in linear time and with constant space complexity.

After applying the fix, the final code in markdown format is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int majorityElement = nums[0];
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == majorityElement) {
                count++;
            } else if (count == 0) {
                majorityElement = nums[i];
                count = 1;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        return majorityElement;
    }
}
```
