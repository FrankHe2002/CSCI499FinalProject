The bug type is a logical error. The original code does not correctly find the pivot and perform the binary search.

From the given code, it is observed that when the pivot is computed, left and right are incorrectly updated by assigning values using `==` instead of shifting the left/right pointers or updating the indices. 
The second issue is with start assignment. It should be equal to the left pointer after the loop ends, not 0.
Further, when identifying the search range, the code incorrectly assigns values to left/right pointers by using if-else conditions to check if the target lies within a certain range, which overcomplicates the logic.

The entire expression for the start and the test condition for target's range should be reconsidered.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) 
            return false;

        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        int pivot = left;
        left = 0;
        right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int realMid = (mid + pivot) % nums.length;
            
            if (nums[realMid] == target) 
                return true;

            if (nums[realMid] < target) 
                left = mid + 1;
            else 
                right = mid - 1;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
