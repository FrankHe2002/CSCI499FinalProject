The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error in the `MyCalendarTwo` class's `book` method.

Explanation:
The `book` method has incorrect logic for checking triple bookings. It fails to properly track triple bookings by comparing all combinations of event intervals. If a new event overlaps with double bookings, it should be rejected.

Fix:
```java
class MyCalendarTwo {
    private List<int[]> bookings;
    private List<int[]> doubleBookings;

    public MyCalendarTwo() {
        bookings = new ArrayList<>();
        doubleBookings = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] b : doubleBookings) {
            if (start < b[1] && end > b[0]) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        for (int[] b : bookings) {
            int overlapStart = Math.max(start, b[0]);
            int overlapEnd = Math.min(end, b[1]);
            if (overlapStart < overlapEnd) {
                doubleBookings.add(new int[] {overlapStart, overlapEnd});
            }
        }
        bookings.add(new int[] {start, end});
        return true;
    }
}
```
The `book` method is now fixed to correctly detect and handle triple bookings.
