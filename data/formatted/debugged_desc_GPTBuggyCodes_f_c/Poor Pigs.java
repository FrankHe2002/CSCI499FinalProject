The bug type identified in the code snippet is a logical error. The original code determines the number of pigs needed to figure out the poisonous bucket within the allotted time, given the number of buckets, minutes to die, and minutes to test. However, the formula to calculate the total number of tests performed by the pigs is incorrect.

The calculation of T, which represents the maximum number of tests a single pig can is incorrect. T should be calculated as the ceiling of (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) instead of the ceiling of (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1.

Additionally, the while loop condition to continue calculating the total number of tests performed by the pigs is incorrect. It should be calculating the total number of tests until total is greater than or equal to buckets.

The following is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int T = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie); // Calculate the number of tests a single pig can perform
        int cnt = 0;
        int totalTests = 1;
        while (totalTests < buckets) { // Calculate the total number of tests until total is greater than or equal to buckets
            totalTests *= (T + 1); // Increment totalTests by T (the number of maximum tests a single pig can perform) plus 1
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
