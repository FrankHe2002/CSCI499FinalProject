Explanation:
The code calculates the sum of differences between each element in the array and the element with index `idx`. This logic is incorrect. The sum of differences from the median value does not provide the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal. Instead, the minimum number of moves can be calculated by finding the median and then calculating the sum of differences of each element with the median.

The fix is to calculate the median of the sorted array and then calculate the sum of absolute differences of each element from the median to obtain the minimum number of moves.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int median = nums[nums.length / 2];
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.abs(nums[i] - median);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
