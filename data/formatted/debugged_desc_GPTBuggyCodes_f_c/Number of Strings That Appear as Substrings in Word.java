Explanation:
The original code causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to the loop condition `i <= patterns.length`, which attempts to access an index out of the array's bounds. In Java, array indices range from 0 to `length - 1`. The fix is changing the loop condition to `i < patterns.length`, ensuring the loop iterates only within the array's valid range.

Additionally, the condition `word.contains(patterns[i])` checks if the entire word contains the pattern, but it needs to identify if the pattern exists as a substring within the word. The fix is to use `word.indexOf(patterns[i]) != -1` to properly identify substrings.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfStrings(String[] patterns, String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < patterns.length; i++) {
            if (word.indexOf(patterns[i]) != -1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
