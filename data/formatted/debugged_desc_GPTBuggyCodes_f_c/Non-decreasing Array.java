The bug in the provided buggy Java code is that the conditional for checking if the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element is not correctly implemented. The code currently checks the previous element but does not modify the element to satisfy the non-decreasing condition.

The fix involves modifying the array to satisfy the non-decreasing condition when the current element is smaller than the previous element. This should be done by comparing the current and previous elements and updating the array.

Fix:
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkPossibility(int[] nums) {
        int modified = 0, index = 1;
        for (; index < nums.length; index++) {
            if (nums[index] < nums[index - 1]) {
                if (++modified > 1) {
                    return false;
                }
                if (index - 2 >= 0 && nums[index] < nums[index - 2]) {
                    nums[index] = nums[index - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
