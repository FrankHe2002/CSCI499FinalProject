Issue: Invalid Comparator for sorting tasks array.

Explanation:
The issue with the provided code is that the comparator is incorrectly implemented. The sorting fails to prioritize tasks according to the required initial energy. This affects the calculation of minimum initial energy requirement.

Fix:
We need to compare based on the calculated energy difference for each task. The corrected code snippet to define the comparator is provided below:

```java
Arrays.sort(tasks, new Comparator<int[]>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
        int diffA = b[1] - b[0];
        int diffB = a[1] - a[0];
        return diffA - diffB; // Compare based on the calculated energy difference
    }
});
```

Fixed code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

class Solution {
    public int minimumEffort(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                int diffA = b[1] - b[0];
                int diffB = a[1] - a[0];
                return diffA - diffB;
            }
        });
        int sum = 0, max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, sum + tasks[i][1]);
            sum += tasks[i][0] + 1;
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
