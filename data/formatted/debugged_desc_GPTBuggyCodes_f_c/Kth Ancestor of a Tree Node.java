The bug type in the provided Java code is a logical error in the `getKthAncestor` method in the `TreeAncestor` class. The logic used to calculate the kth ancestor node index is incorrect, as it does not accurately represent the kth ancestor of the given node.

The error specifically occurs in the `getKthAncestor` method where the index calculation for the kth ancestor node is off by one, which leads to incorrect results. Additionally, the condition in the return statement also needs to be updated to handle cases where the kth ancestor does not exist.

The fix involves modifying the calculation of the node index in the path and adjusting the condition to return -1 if there is no kth ancestor.

Fix:

```java
class TreeAncestor {
    int n;
    int[] parent;
    List<Integer>[] nodeInPath;
    int[] nodeIdxInPath;

    public TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent) {
        this.n = n;
        this.parent = parent;
        nodeInPath = new ArrayList[n];
        nodeIdxInPath = new int[n];
        fill();
    }

    private void fill() {
        boolean[] inner = new boolean[n];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            inner[parent[i]] = true;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (inner[i] || nodeInPath[i] != null) {
                continue;
            }
            List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<>();
            int k = i;
            while (k != - 1) {
                path.add(k);
                k = parent[k];
            }
            int m = path.size();
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                int node = path.get(j);
                if (nodeInPath[node] != null) break;
                nodeInPath[node] = path;
                nodeIdxInPath[node] = j;
            }
        }
    }

    public int getKthAncestor(int node, int k) {
        List<Integer> path = nodeInPath[node];
        int idx = nodeIdxInPath[node] - k;
        return (idx >= 0 && idx < path.size()) ? path.get(idx) : -1;
    }
}
```
