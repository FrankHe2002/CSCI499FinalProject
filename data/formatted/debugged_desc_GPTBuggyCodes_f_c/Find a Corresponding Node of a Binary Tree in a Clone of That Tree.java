The implementation of the getTargetCopy function is incorrect. It is using a global parameter (ref) and null TreeNode elements, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should validate if the target node is found in the cloned binary tree and directly return the corresponding node.

To fix this problem, we need to pass the cloned node directly to the helper method in order to find the corresponding node in the cloned tree. Therefore, the dfs method should return the TreeNode when it finds the target and getTargetCopy should directly return the result of calling the dfs method, removing the need for the ref array.

The fixed code is as follows:

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public final TreeNode getTargetCopy(final TreeNode original, final TreeNode cloned, final TreeNode target) {
        return dfs(cloned, target);
    }

    public static TreeNode dfs(TreeNode root, TreeNode target) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        if (root.val == target.val) {
            return root;
        } else {
            TreeNode left = dfs(root.left, target);
            TreeNode right = dfs(root.right, target);
			
            return left != null ? left : right;
        }
    }
}
```
By modifying the dfs method to return the found TreeNode directly and updating the getTargetCopy method to return its value, the issue has been fixed.
