The bug in the given Java code is as follows:
- The logic inside the checkPowersOfThree method doesn't correctly check if an integer can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three. The algorithm uses a greedy approach to subtract the maximum possible power of 3 from the given integer until the resulting value is 0, but this approach doesn't guarantee the correct representation.

To fix this, we can use a simple backtracking approach to try all possible combinations of powers of three to see if the input 'n' can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        return canBeRepresented(n, 0, 1);
    }
    
    private boolean canBeRepresented(int n, int currentSum, int currentPower) {
        if (currentSum == n) {
            return true;
        }
        if (currentSum > n || currentPower > n) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return canBeRepresented(n, currentSum + currentPower, currentPower * 3) || canBeRepresented(n, currentSum, currentPower * 3);
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, we define a recursive method 'canBeRepresented' that tries all possible combinations of powers of three to see if the input 'n' can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three.
