Explanation:
The `fillCups` method is supposed to calculate the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups of water based on the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups needed. The logic to determine the minimum time is incorrect, resulting in an incorrect output.

The logic currently implemented in the method is handling only specific cases and not providing an accurate computation for all cases.

The fix is to correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds needed based on the number of cups needed for each type of water.

Fix:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int fillCups(int[] amount) {
        Arrays.sort(amount);
        int x = amount[0];
        int y = amount[1];
        int z = amount[2];

        if (x + y <= z) {
            return x + y;
        } else {
            return (x + y + z) / 2 + (x + y + z) % 2;
        }
    }
}
```
