The issue with the provided Java code is related to the `validPalindrome` method. When a character mismatch is found, it attempts to delete a character and then calls the `validPalindrome` method recursively for both the left and right substrings.

The issue arises from the handling of the first mismatched character. The variable `first` is used to track if a character has already been removed, but its usage is incorrect. It is used to allow the removal of only a single character, but the logic used for its verification is insufficient.

To fix this issue, the condition for the first mismatched character should involve checking whether the substring after removing the left mismatched character or the right mismatched character is a palindrome. If both are not palindromes, the unavailability of valid palindromes should be detected. 

Here's the fixed code for `validPalindrome`:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validPalindrome(String s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                return isPalindrome(s, left + 1, right) || isPalindrome(s, left, right - 1);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left <= right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

This fixed code handles the comparison of characters, identifies positions for substring checks, and verifies the validity of palindromes after character removal accordingly.
