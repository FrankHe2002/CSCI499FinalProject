The bug in the code is that it incorrectly calculates the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of the staircase. The code currently returns the result of subtracting the number of ways to climb n - 2 steps from the number of ways to climb n - 1 steps, which is incorrect. It should instead calculate and return the sum of the number of ways to climb n - 1 steps and the number of ways to climb n - 2 steps.

Here is the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
            return n;
        }
        
        int[] memo = new int[n + 1];
        memo[1] = 1;
        memo[2] = 2;

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];
        }
        
        return memo[n];
    }
}
```
