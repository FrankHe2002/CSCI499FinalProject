Explanation:
The original code is incorrect because it doesn't correctly calculate the digital root of the given number. It uses an incorrect formula to calculate the remainder of the number when divided by 8. The correct formula should involve modulo 9. The implementation should also consider the cases of numbers divisible by 9 and 0.

Fix:
```java
class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        return num % 9 == 0 ? 9 : num % 9;
    }
}
```
