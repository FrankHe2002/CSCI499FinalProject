The code has a bug identified as a logical error which may cause an infinite loop during execution. The condition `for (int i = 0; i < len; i--)` decrements the value of `i` in the loop initializer, which results in an infinite loop. This happens because for each iteration of the loop, `i` keeps decreasing since it starts at 0, and is consistently decremented, causing the condition `i < len` to always be true.

The fix is to increment the value of `i` in the loop initializer. Changing `i--` to `i++` ensures that `i` increments in each iteration of the loop and prevents infinite looping.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIdenticalPairs(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
                if (nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
```
