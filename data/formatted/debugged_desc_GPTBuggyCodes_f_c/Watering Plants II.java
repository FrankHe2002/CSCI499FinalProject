The bug in the provided Java code of the `minimumRefill` function is that it doesn't properly handle the process of refilling each watering can when needed and calculating the count for refilling. 

To fix this, it is necessary to reimplement the logic in the function, ensuring both watering cans are refilled properly, determining the priority when both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, and calculating the total number of refills required. 

The following is the fixed code where comments have been added to explain each section of the fixed `minimumRefill` function:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumRefill(int[] plants, int capacityA, int capacityB) {
        int count = 0;
        int c1 = capacityA, c2 = capacityB;
        for (int i = 0; i <= plants.length / 2; i++) {
            int start = i;
            int end = plants.length - 1 - i;

            if (start == end) { // Both Alice and Bob have reached the center plant
                if (c1 >= c2) { 
                    if (plants[start] > c1) count++;
                } else {
                    if (plants[start] > c2) count++;
                }
                continue;
            }

            while (c1 < plants[start]) { // Refill Alice's watering can
                c1 = capacityA;
                count++;
            }
            
            c1 -= plants[start]; // Water the current plant

            while (c2 < plants[end]) { // Refill Bob's watering can
                c2 = capacityB;
                count++;
            }
            
            c2 -= plants[end]; // Water the current plant  
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
