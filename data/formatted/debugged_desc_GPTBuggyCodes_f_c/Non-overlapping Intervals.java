The code provided defines the `eraseOverlapIntervals` method, which aims to return the minimum number of intervals to be removed to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

However, the implementation is incorrect, and it will not produce the expected result. The issue arises from the comparison of the `interval[0]` value, and the condition to check whether `interval[1] >= end`. Additionally, the sorting of intervals `Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0])`, seems to be performed in reverse order.

The correct implementation requires the sorting of intervals based on their end values. Then, iterate through the sorted intervals to detect overlapping intervals and remove them. The goal is to find the smallest number of intervals to be removed to guarantee non-overlapping intervals.

The final fixed code to address these issues is shown below:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));

        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int[] interval = intervals[i];
            if (interval[0] < end) {
                res++;
            } else {
                end = interval[1];
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

This fix involves correcting the sorting of intervals and the logic to compare overlapping intervals, ensuring the correct identification of the minimum number of intervals to remove.
