The bug in the provided code is related to the logic of counting type 1 and type 2 triplets. The current logic is not accurately identifying the number of triplets.

To fix the issue, first, we need to account for the cases where `prod == x` but differ over `b[j]` and `b[k]`. Such cases should not be directly added to `count`, instead, we should iterate over the duplicate cells present at `b[j]` and `b[k]` to find their range and increment `count` based on these cases.

Second, we also need to handle the scenarios when `prod == x` but don't have `b[j] != b[k]`. In such cases, we need to count the number of pairs and add it to the count.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int numTriplets(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
        Arrays.sort(nums2);
        return count(nums1, nums2) + count(nums2, nums1);
    }

    public int count(int a[], int b[]) {
        int n = a.length;
        int m = b.length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long x = (long) a[i] * a[i];
            int j = 0;
            int k = m - 1;
            while (j < k) {
                long prod = (long) b[j] * b[k];
                if (prod < x)
                    j++;
                else if (prod > x)
                    k--;
                else if (b[j] != b[k]) {
                    int jNew = j;
                    int kNew = k;

                    while (b[j] == b[jNew])
                        jNew++;
                    while (b[k] == b[kNew])
                        kNew--;
                    count += (jNew - j) * (k - kNew);
                    j = jNew;
                    k = kNew;

                } else {
                    int q = k - j + 1;
                    count += (q) * (q - 1) / 2;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

The provided fixed code takes into account the scenarios where logic was missing and the correct count of triplets is returned.
