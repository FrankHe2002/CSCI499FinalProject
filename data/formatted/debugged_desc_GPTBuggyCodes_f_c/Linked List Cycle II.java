Based on the code provided, the error observed here is in creating the hare node. To create a new ListNode for the hare pointer, a new instance was created as `new ListNode()` leading to an unlinked node. Further, the line `hare.next = head.next` is incorrect, and the previous line `singletonNode.next = head.next` was presumably meant to set the hare pointer to be the head of the original list so setting `hare.next = head` would be a better choice. Lastly, the logic used to check for the existence of a cycle has some errors due to incorrect assignments and comparisons, these would have to be updated so that the correct node where the cycle begins is returned. 

In the while loop when detecting the cycle itself, the hare is incremented but there are no checks to ensure it does not go out of bounds as the hare moves 2 steps ahead each time. The final decision for where to look for the cycle and where to return that cycle must account for these checks.


```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode tortoise = head, hare = head;
        while (hare != null && hare.next != null) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next.next;
            if (tortoise == hare) {
                ListNode current = head;
                while (current != tortoise) {
                    current = current.next;
                    tortoise = tortoise.next;
                }
                return current;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
