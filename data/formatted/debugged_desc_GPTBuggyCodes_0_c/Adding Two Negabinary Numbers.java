The bug in this code is in the part where we calculate the `carry` value for different cases of the `sum` calculations. The calculations of the `carry` value can produce negative carry values, leading to the incorrect result.

Here's the step-by-step process of identifying and fixing the bug:

1. Whenever the sum is 0, we should not decrease the carry. The current logic decrements the carry value irrespective of the sum value, which is incorrect.

2. If the sum is 2 or 3, the carry value may become negative based on the current logic, which is not handled properly.

Here's the fix for the identified bug:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] addNegabinary(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList();
        int pointer_1 = arr1.length - 1;
        int pointer_2 = arr2.length - 1;

        int carry = 0;
        int current, sum;

        while (pointer_1 >= 0 || pointer_2 >= 0 || carry != 0) {
            int a = (pointer_1 >= 0) ? arr1[pointer_1] : 0;
            int b = (pointer_2 >= 0) ? arr2[pointer_2] : 0;

            sum = a + b + carry;

            current = sum % 2;
            carry = -(sum / 2);

            if (current < 0) {
                current += 2;
                carry++;
            }

            result.add(0, current);

            pointer_1--;
            pointer_2--;
        }

        // remove leading zeroes
        while (!result.isEmpty() && result.get(0) == 0) {
            result.remove(0);
        }

        if (result.isEmpty()) {
            return new int[] {0}; // return [0] if result is empty
        }

        int[] negaBinary = new int[result.size()];

        for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
            negaBinary[i] = result.get(i);
        }

        return negaBinary;
    }
}
```

After applying the fix, the code will produce the correct result by adjusting the carry value to fit the condition of negative carry. Also, optimizations are minimized as requested.
