The code seems to be correct at first glance, as it is recursively inserting the new node into the correct position in the binary search tree. However, a bug may exist if the original BST is empty (i.e., root is null).

To identify and fix the bug:
1. Check if the root node is null. If it is, create a new TreeNode with the given value and return it.
2. If the root node is not null, continue with the current approach.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode insertIntoBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }

        if (root.val >= val) {
            root.left = insertIntoBST(root.left, val);
        } else {
            root.right = insertIntoBST(root.right, val);
        }

        return root;
    }
}
```
