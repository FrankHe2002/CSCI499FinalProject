The code seems to be correct, but the bug may occur if the graph is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The code does not check for cycles in the graph, which could cause an infinite loop. 

To fix this potential bug, we need to check for cycles in the helper method by passing a list of visited nodes and checking if the current node is present in the list. If it is, then there is a cycle in the graph, and we should return without further recursion.

Here's the updated code with minimal changes to fix the potential bug:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
        boolean[] visit = new boolean[graph.length];
        helper(graph, 0, graph.length - 1, ans, temp, visit);

        return ans;
    }

    public void helper(int[][] graph, int src, int dest, List<List<Integer>> ans, List<Integer> temp, boolean[] vis) {
        if (temp.contains(src)) {
            return; // Detected a cycle, return
        }

        vis[src] = true;
        temp.add(src);
        if (src == dest) {
            List<Integer> b = new ArrayList<>(temp);
            ans.add(b);
        }

        for (int i : graph[src]) {
            helper(graph, i, dest, ans, temp, vis);
        }

        vis[src] = false;
        temp.remove(temp.size() - 1);
    }
}
```

In the updated code, we added the cycle detection condition in the helper method. If the current node is already present in the `temp` list, we return from the method, effectively stopping the current path if it contains a cycle. This would fix the potential bug related to handling cycles in the graph.
