Bug type: Logical error

The code is intended to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the nums array and then check if the GCD is equal to 1 to determine if the array is "good." However, the current implementation returns true if the GCD is equal to 2, which is incorrect.

To fix this logical error, the code needs to be updated so that it returns false if the GCD is equal to 2, and true only if the GCD is equal to 1.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isGoodArray(int[] nums) {
        int gcd = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            gcd = GCD(gcd, nums[i]);
            if (gcd == 1)
                return true; // If GCD is equal to 1, array is good
        }
        return false; // If GCD is not 1, array is not good
    }

    int GCD(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return GCD(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
```
