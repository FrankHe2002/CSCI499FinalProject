The bug in the code is that the current node's value may become out of range after trimming, and it only checks the root while ignoring the left and right subtrees.

To fix the bug, we need to first trim the left and right subtrees, and then check if the current root's value is out of range and fix it if necessary.

We can apply the following fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        root.right = trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        
        if (root.val < low) {
            return root.right;
        }
        if (root.val > high) {
            return root.left;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```
