The bug type in the given code is a logical error. The code does not correctly determine if the given nodes are cousins in the binary tree.

To identify and fix the bug, follow the steps below:

1. The `parentSet` should store the parents of the given nodes `x` and `y`. Therefore, change the condition where the size of `parentSet` is checked to see if it's greater or equal to 2. If two different nodes of the tree have the same depth with different parents, they can be considered cousins.
2. Instead of just returning `parentSet.size() == 3`, which is a hard-coded check, return `true` if and only if both `x` and `y` are found and their corresponding parents are stored in the `parentSet`.
3. If none of the conditions are met, return `false`.

Here's the modified code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isCousins(TreeNode root, int x, int y) {
        Set<TreeNode> parentSet = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int len = q.size();
            boolean foundX = false;
            boolean foundY = false;

            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                TreeNode parent = q.remove();

                for (TreeNode child : new TreeNode[] {parent.left, parent.right}) {
                    if (child != null) {
                        q.add(child);
                        if (child.val == x)
                            foundX = true;
                        if (child.val == y)
                            foundY = true;
                        if (child.val == x || child.val == y)
                            parentSet.add(parent);
                    }
                }
            }
            if (foundX && foundY) // Both nodes x and y were found in this level
                return parentSet.size() == 2; // Parent set should contain two different parents
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This fixes the logical error in the code and ensures that the correct conditions are checked to determine if the given nodes are cousins in the binary tree.
