The bug in the provided code is related to the logic for checking the unique occurrences of each value in the array.

Here is the explanation of the reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The code takes an array of integers as input and checks for the unique occurrences of each value in the array.
2. It sorts the array to group the same values together.
3. It then uses a HashSet to store the count of occurrences for each value.
4. However, the bug occurs in the for loop where it increments the count variable c without checking if the value has changed.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the for loop needs to be modified to handle the count of occurrences correctly.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public boolean uniqueOccurrences(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(map.values());
        return set.size() == map.size();
    }
}
```
In this bug fix:
1. Instead of using a counter variable, a HashMap is used to store the count of occurrences for each value in the array.
2. After populating the map, a HashSet is created from the values to check for uniqueness.
3. The size of the HashSet is then compared with the size of the map, and if they are equal, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
