The bug in the code is that if the last word is immediately followed by a space, the code will return a length of 0.

To fix the bug, we need to update the while loop condition to handle the case where the last word is immediately followed by a space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int j = s.length() - 1, len = 0;
        boolean flag = false;
        while (j >= 0 && (s.charAt(j) == ' ')) {
            j--;
        }
        while (j >= 0 && s.charAt(j) != ' ') {
            len++;
            j--;
        }
        return len;
    }
}
```
