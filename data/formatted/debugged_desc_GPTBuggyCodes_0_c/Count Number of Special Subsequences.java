The given Java code seems to have a bug where the calculation for each subsequence type is not taking into account the mod value correctly, which could result in incorrect values. 

To fix the bug:
1. First, we need to ensure that the mod operation is applied at each step when calculating `z`, `zo`, and `zot` to prevent large values from causing an overflow.
2. Second, we need to remove the mod operation when calculating `z`, `zo`, and `zot`.

Here's the updated code with the fixes:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countSpecialSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        long z = 0;
        long zo = 0;
        long zot = 0;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i == 0) {
                z = (2 * z + 1) % mod;
            } else if (i == 1) {
                zo = (2 * zo + z) % mod;
            } else {
                zot = (2 * zot + zo) % mod;
            }
        }
        return (int) zot;
    }
}
```

These changes ensure that the mod operation is correctly applied in each step, preventing overflow and returning the correct result according to the mod value.
