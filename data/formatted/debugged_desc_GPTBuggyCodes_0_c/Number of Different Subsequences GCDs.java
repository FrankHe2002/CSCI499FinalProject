The code seems to have a bug in the `gcd` function. The Euclidean algorithm used to find the greatest common divisor is faulty and may return wrong results.

Here's the corrected function with the bug fix:

```java
public int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}
```

With this bug fix, the `gcd` function will now correctly calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

The rest of the code is fine and does not need any additional fixes.
