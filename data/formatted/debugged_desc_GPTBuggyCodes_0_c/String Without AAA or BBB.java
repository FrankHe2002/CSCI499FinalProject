Bug type: Logical error

The logic in the given code is incorrect and does not guarantee that the provided constraints are satisfied. The code does not correctly handle cases where 'a' or 'b' is equal to 0.

1. The code should ensure that the generated string does not contain 'aaa' and 'bbb'.
2. The code should handle cases where 'a' or 'b' is equal to 0.
3. The code should be modified to follow the constraints properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String strWithout3a3b(int a, int b) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        while (a > 0 || b > 0) {
            boolean writeA = false;
            int l = sb.length();
            if (l >= 2 && sb.charAt(l - 1) == sb.charAt(l - 2)) {
                if (sb.charAt(l - 1) == 'b') {
                    writeA = true;
                }
            } else {
                if (a >= b) {
                    writeA = true;
                }
            }
            
            if (writeA) {
                sb.append("a");
                a--;
            } else {
                sb.append("b");
                b--;
            }
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

The modified code addresses the logical errors and the constraints properly:
1. It constructs the string in such a way that 'aaa' and 'bbb' do not occur.
2. It efficiently handles cases where 'a' or 'b' is equal to 0.
3. The code now follows the constraints of the problem statement.
