Bug: The bug exists in the `cal` method. The algorithm doesn't accurately calculate the number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots in the grid.

Reasoning process:
1. The outer loop iterates over each row starting from the second row (i = 1).
2. The inner loop iterates over each column and counts the number of continuous fertile cells.
3. If the current cell is not barren, the count increments, else it resets to 0.
4. If the count is 0 or j is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
5. The current cell's value then gets updated based on the minimum of two values.
6. Finally, the result increments based on the calculated value for the current cell.

Fix:
The bug is due to the incorrect calculation in updating the current cell's value. We need to calculate the number of valid pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots using the given criteria. Update the cal method to count the appropriate number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots by following the given criteria.

Updated code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countPyramids(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] rev = new int[n][m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++ i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++ j) rev[j][i] = grid[i][j];
        }
        return cal(grid) + cal(rev);
    }

    private int cal(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length, res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++ i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++ j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    res++;
                    int k = 0;
                    while (i - k >= 0 && i + k < m && j - k >= 0 && j + k < n) {
                        boolean valid = true;
                        for (int l = i - k; l <= i + k; ++l) {
                            for(int o = j - k; o <= j + k; ++o) {
                                if (grid[l][o] != 1) {
                                    valid = false;
                                    break;
                                }
                            }
                            if (!valid) {
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                        if (valid) {
                            res++;
                        } else {
                            break;
                        }
                        k++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
The fix includes updating the iteration start index for i in the `cal` method and re-implementing the logic to calculate the number of valid pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots based on the requirements.
