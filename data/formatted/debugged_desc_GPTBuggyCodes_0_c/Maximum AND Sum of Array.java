The bug in the code is the incorrect calculation and storage of the results in the `memo` array. The incorrect calculations in the helper method are due to an off-by-one error, leading to incorrect values being stored in the memoization array, causing the wrong results.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the calculation of the max value and memoization storage. We also need to make sure that we are using bitwise AND operator while performing the calculations.

Here's the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    int[] memo;
    int[] nums;
    int numSlots;

    public int maximumANDSum(int[] nums, int numSlots) {
        this.memo = new int[1 << (2 * numSlots)];
        this.nums = nums;
        this.numSlots = numSlots;
        return helper(0, 0);
    }

    int helper(int numIndex, int set) {
        if (numIndex == nums.length) return 0;
        if (memo[set] > 0) return memo[set];
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < numSlots * 2; i++) {
            if ((set & (1 << i)) != 0) continue;
            int slotAnd = i / 2 + 1;
            int andSum = (slotAnd) & nums[numIndex];
            max = Math.max(max, andSum + helper(numIndex + 1, set | (1 << i)));
        }
        memo[set] = max;
        return max;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we modified the `helper` method to correctly calculate the AND sum with respect to the slot chosen and the number in the array. We also fixed the memoization storage so that it stores the correct maximum value for a given state `set`.
