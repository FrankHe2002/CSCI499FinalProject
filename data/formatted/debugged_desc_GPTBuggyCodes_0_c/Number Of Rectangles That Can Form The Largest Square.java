The code initializes a `max` variable to 0 and a `count` variable to 0. It then iterates through the input array of rectangles, adds the length of the smaller side of each rectangle to a list, and updates the `max` variable to the length of the smaller side of the rectangle if that length is greater than the current `max`. Finally, it iterates through the list and increments `count` for each length that is not equal to `max`, and returns the `count`.

However, the issue is that it does not return the number of rectangles that can form a square with a side length of `max`. Instead, it returns the number of distinct side lengths in the list.

To fix the issue, I will:
1. Create a counter variable to count the number of rectangles with the same side length as `max`.
2. Replace the for-each loop that iterates through the list with a for loop that compares each side length to `max` and increments the counter if they are equal.

Here's the updated code:
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int countGoodRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
        List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();
        int max = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rectangles.length; i++) {
            if (rectangles[i][0] > rectangles[i][1]) {
                list.add(rectangles[i][1]);
                if (max < rectangles[i][1])
                    max = rectangles[i][1];
            } else {
                list.add(rectangles[i][0]);
                if (max < rectangles[i][0])
                    max = rectangles[i][0];
            }
        }
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
            if (list.get(i) == max) {
                counter++;
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
```
