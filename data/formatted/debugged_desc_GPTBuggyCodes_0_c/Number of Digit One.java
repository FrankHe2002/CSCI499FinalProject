Bug Type: Logical Error

The issue in the code is with the countDigitOne method. It should count the number of 1s appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n, but the current implementation does not produce the correct result.

To fix the bug in countDigitOne method, we need to revise the calculation of the count of 1s.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    int max(int a, int b) {
        if (a > b)
            return a;
        else
            return b;
    }

    int min(int a, int b) {
        if (a > b)
            return b;
        else
            return a;
    }

    public int countDigitOne(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (long i = 1; i <= n; i *= 10) {
            long divider = i * 10;
            count += (n / divider) * i + min(max(n % divider - i + 1, 0), i);
        }
        return count;
    }

    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}
```

The changes made in the countDigitOne method involve using long data types to avoid integer overflow and also modifying the formula for the count calculation. The revised formula correctly counts the number of 1s appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
