The bug in the given code is that the combination of food items with the same index is also being counted as different food items.

To identify and fix the bug, we need to review the logic and flow of the code. The code is trying to find pairs of food items that have a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two. It is using a map to store the frequency of each deliciousness value and then iterating through the list to find the pairs.

The bug is that at the end, the code returns `(int) (res % mod + 1)` which erroneously adds 1 to the result. It should return the result without adding 1 as there is no need for this additional increment.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    int mod = 1000000007;

    public int countPairs(int[] arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int n = arr.length;
        long res = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            int power = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < 22; i++) {
                if (map.containsKey(power - num)) {
                    res += map.get(power - num);
                    res %= mod;
                }
                power *= 2;
            }
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        return (int) (res % mod);
    }
}
```
