The bug in the code is that it does not calculate the XOR sum of the result of arr1[i] AND arr2[j] (bitwise AND) for every (i, j) pair.

Let's fix the bug in the code by adding a loop to calculate the XOR sum of the result of arr1[i] AND arr2[j] for every (i, j) pair.

```java
class Solution {

    public int getXORSum(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int[] x = (arr1.length < arr2.length ? arr2 : arr1);
        int[] y = (arr1.length < arr2.length ? arr1 : arr2);
        int xorSumX = 0;
        for (int xi : x) {
            xorSumX ^= xi;
        }
        int answer = 0;
        for (int xi : x) {
            for (int yj : y) {
                answer ^= (xi & yj);
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }

}
```

In the fixed code, we have added a nested loop to calculate the XOR sum of the result of arr1[i] AND arr2[j] for every (i, j) pair. This fixes the bug in the original code.
