The issue with this code is with the calculation of the average. The code adds the value of the current node to the `row` variable, and at the end of each level, it calculates the average by dividing `row` by `qlen - 1`. The issue is that we are missing the node of the last level.

To fix this issue, we need to change `row / (qlen - 1)` to `row / qlen`. 

Here's the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>(List.of(root));
        List<Double> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (q.size() > 0) {
            double qlen = q.size(), row = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < qlen; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = q.poll();
                row += curr.val;
                if (curr.left != null) q.offer(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) q.offer(curr.right);
            }
            ans.add(row / qlen);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
