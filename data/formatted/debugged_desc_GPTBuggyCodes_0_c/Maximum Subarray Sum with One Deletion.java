The given code seems to have a bug as the program is not passing all the test cases for different inputs.

Upon reviewing the code, the issue seems to be with the logic used to compute the maximum sum for a non-empty subarray with at most one element deletion. The approach outlined in the code might not be correct.

To identify the bug, we should focus on the problem statement and understand the constraints provided.

Here's the reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The prefix sum is correctly computed, so we can skip that part of the code.
2. The issue seems to be with the second for loop, where it tries to find the maximum sum by deleting one element from a subarray.
3. The logic within the second for loop needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure it accurately captures the constraints of the problem.
4. It seems that the two nested loops to find the left and right prefix sum can be simplified.
5. The bug is likely in the logic that computes the left and right prefix sum and then tries to find the maximum sum by deleting one element.

Here's the modified code with minimal changes to fix the bug:
```java
public int maximumSum(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int ans = (int) -1e9;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][2];
        dp[0][0] = arr[0];
        dp[0][1] = 0;

        ans = Math.max(ans, dp[0][0]);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0] + arr[i], arr[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] + arr[i]);
            ans = Math.max(ans, Math.max(dp[i][0], dp[i][1]));
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

In this modified code, we initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum sum with at most one element deletion. We then use this array to iterate through the input array and compute the maximum sum accordingly. This approach ensures that the constraints of the problem are accurately captured and maximizes the sum of the subarray.

These changes should fix the bug and provide the correct result for the given problem statement and constraints.
