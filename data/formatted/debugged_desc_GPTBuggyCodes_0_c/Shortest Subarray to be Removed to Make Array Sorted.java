Bug type: Logical Error

The given code aims to find the shortest subarray that needs to be removed from the original array to ensure the remaining elements are non-decreasing. However, the current implementation has a logical error because it does not always return the correct result.

To fix the bug, we can re-implement the algorithm in the following way:
1. Find the length of the increasing sequence from the beginning of the array.
2. Find the length of the increasing sequence from the end of the array.
3. If the entire array is in increasing order, return 0.
4. Consider removing the first x elements and the last y elements and find the minimum length based on the remaining sequence lengths. Take note that when x and y are both 0, the length is arr.length-1.

Here's the updated code with the logical error fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfShortestSubarray(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int left = 0;
        while (left < n - 1 && arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]) {
            left++;
        }
        
        if (left == n - 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int right = n - 1;
        while (right > 0 && arr[right - 1] <= arr[right]) {
            right--;
        }
        
        int result = Math.min(n - left - 1, right); // If the entire array is in increasing order, result is n - left - 1
        
        int i = 0;
        int j = right;
        
        while (i <= left && j < n) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
                result = Math.min(result, j - i - 1);
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
