Bug type: Logical error

The logic for checking which character to append to the merge string is incorrect, leading to wrong results.

Here's the step by step reasoning process for identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The given function 'largestMerge' takes two string inputs and constructs a merged string following certain rules.
2. It uses two pointers 'i' and 'j' to iterate through the characters of the input strings.
3. Inside the while loop, if condition is incorrectly checking the current characters of word1 and word2.
4. The 'check' method is also incorrect in determining the comparison of remaining characters.

To fix the bug, we need to change the logic for comparing and appending characters to the merge string.

Here's the updated code with minimal changes:

```java
class Solution {
    public String largestMerge(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while (i < word1.length() && j < word2.length()) {
            if (word1.substring(i).compareTo(word2.substring(j)) > 0) {
                sb.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            } else {
                sb.append(word2.charAt(j++));
            }
        }
        
        sb.append(word1.substring(i));
        sb.append(word2.substring(j));

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

In the update, the comparison logic is directly done using `compareTo` method based on the remaining parts of word1 and word2.
No need for the 'check' method as we compare the remaining strings directly.
