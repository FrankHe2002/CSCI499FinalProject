The code provided seems to have a bug. The loop that is meant to adjust the value based on the operations does not cover all the possible operations that should be performed according to the problem description. Specifically, it is not correctly applying the bitwise-XOR operation on the `val` variable and the `num` in the loop.

To fix this, we need to update the bitwise-XOR operation in the loop to adjust the value of `val` based on the `num`:

```java
q.offer(val ^ num);
```

Adding this line will correctly add the result of the bitwise-XOR operation between `val` and `num` to the queue.

Here is the complete corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums, int start, int goal) {
        int res = 0;
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        q.offer(start);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int val = q.poll();
                if (val == goal) return res;
                if (val < 0 || val > 1000 || set.contains(val)) continue;
                set.add(val);

                for (int num : nums) {
                    q.offer(val + num);
                    q.offer(val - num);
                    q.offer(val ^ num);
                }
            }
            res++;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```

The code now correctly handles all three types of operations and should return the minimum number of operations needed to convert `start` into `goal`.
