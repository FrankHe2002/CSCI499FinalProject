The code is trying to find the extra letter added to string t by comparing it with string s using XOR operation.

The algorithm first iterates through string s and performs XOR operation on each character, and then iterates through string t and performs the same operation. Finally, it returns the XOR result, converted to lowercase.

Upon initial review, the code looks correct, but it is missing the logic to handle the situation when the extra letter is at the end of the string t.

To fix this, we can add a check to see if the length of strings s and t is different, and if so, consider the last character of t as the extra added letter.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for (char cs : s.toCharArray()) c ^= cs;
        for (char ct : t.toCharArray()) c ^= ct;
        
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            int lastIndex = t.length() - 1;
            c ^= t.charAt(lastIndex);
        }
        
        return Character.toLowerCase(c);
    }
}
```
