The bug in the provided code is in the while loop. The loop is not correctly handling the conditions for when both p and q are even. Additionally, the return statement does not have appropriate logic to determine which receptor the ray meets first.

To fix this issue, we first need to handle the case when both p and q are even. We need to continue halving p and q until either p becomes odd or q becomes odd. Then, we can use a simple if-else condition to determine the receptor the ray meets first.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        while (p % 2 == 0 && q % 2 == 0) {
            p >>= 1;
            q >>= 1;
        }
        
        if (p % 2 == 1 && q % 2 == 0) {
            return 0; // Ray meets receptor 0
        } else if (p % 2 == 1 && q % 2 == 1) {
            return 1; // Ray meets receptor 1
        } else {
            return 2; // Ray meets receptor 2
        }
    }
}
```
