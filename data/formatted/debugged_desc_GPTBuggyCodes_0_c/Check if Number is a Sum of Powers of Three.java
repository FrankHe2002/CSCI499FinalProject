The bug in the code is that it does not take into account whether the powers of three used to represent the number n are distinct or not. For example, if n = 19, the code will return true (19 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^0), but this is incorrect because the powers of three used are not distinct.

To fix the bug, we need to keep track of the powers of three used to represent the number n and ensure that they are distinct. We can use a set to keep track of the powers of three encountered during the calculation and check for duplicates.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public boolean checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int maxPower = (int) (Math.log(n) / Math.log(3));
        int[] threePower = new int[maxPower + 1];
        threePower[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= maxPower; i++) {
            threePower[i] = threePower[i - 1] * 3;
        }
        
        for (int i = maxPower; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (n >= threePower[i]) {
                n -= threePower[i];
                if (set.contains(i)) {
                    return false; // power of three is not distinct
                }
                set.add(i);
            }
        }

        return n == 0;
    }
}
```

In the updated code, we added a set to keep track of the powers of three encountered. Inside the second loop, we also added a check to ensure that the powers of three are distinct. If we encounter a power of three that already exists in the set, we return false immediately. Otherwise, we add the power of three to the set.
