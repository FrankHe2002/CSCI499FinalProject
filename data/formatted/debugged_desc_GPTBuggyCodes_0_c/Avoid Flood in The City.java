The bug in the provided code lies in the logic for adding the current index into the `zeros` set. The current index `i` should be added to the `zeros` set only when there is no rain on that lake. However, the current code adds the index to the `zeros` set regardless of the rain condition.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic of adding to the `zeros` set. This will ensure that we only add the index to `zeros` if there is no rain on that lake.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] avoidFlood(int[] rains) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        TreeSet<Integer> zeros = new TreeSet<>();
        int[] res = new int[rains.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rains.length; i++) {
            if (rains[i] == 0) {
                zeros.add(i);
                res[i] = 1; // fill the res array with 1 to indicate empty lake
            } else {
                if (map.containsKey(rains[i])) {
                    int prevRainIdx = map.get(rains[i]);
                    Integer dryDay = zeros.ceiling(prevRainIdx);
                    if (dryDay == null) return new int[0];
                    res[dryDay] = rains[i];
                    zeros.remove(dryDay); // remove the filled lake from zeros set
                }
                res[i] = -1;
                map.put(rains[i], i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

In the modified code, while iterating through the `rains` array, the program now appropriately checks for rainy days versus non-rainy days and takes the correct action based on the condition. The logic for adding to the `zeros` set has been updated to add the index and fill the `res` array with 1 when there is no rain, and the existing logic for dealing with rainy days has been retained.
