Bug Type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
The code aims to find the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. The logic used in the provided code is to sort the intervals in descending order based on their start points, and then iterate through the intervals to check for overlaps.

Initially, the start and end variables are set to the start and end points of the first interval. Then, for each subsequent interval, if it overlaps with the current interval (i.e., if its start point is within the range of the current interval), the overlap counter `res` is incremented, and the end point is updated if needed.

The issue in the current implementation involves how the condition for overlapping intervals is being checked and how the end point update is being handled. The condition `if (interval[0] >= start && interval[0] < end)` is incorrect, as it does not correctly capture overlapping intervals in all cases. Additionally, the end point update logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Fix:
I will fix the logical errors in the code by correcting the condition for checking overlapping intervals and updating the end point appropriately. Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int[] interval = intervals[i];

            if (interval[0] < end) {
                res++;
                end = Math.min(end, interval[1]); // Update end to the minimum end point of overlapping intervals
            } else {
                end = interval[1];
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

In this fix, I have corrected the sorting order of intervals in ascending order based on their start points. I have then updated the condition for checking overlapping intervals and modified the end point update logic to correctly handle the intervals' end points. These changes should address the logical errors and provide the correct result for the minimum number of intervals to be removed.
