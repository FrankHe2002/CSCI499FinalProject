The bug in the code is likely due to the nested loops iterating over the coordinates of the queens, as well as the incorrect handling of the array indices in the loops. We need to go through the coordinates of the queens to check if they can attack the king, and the current code is not traversing the coordinates properly.

Here's the modified code to fix the bug:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> queensAttacktheKing(int[][] queens, int[] king) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int r = king[0];
        int l = king[1];
        int[][] board = new int[8][8];
        int n = queens.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < queens.length; i++) {
            int row = queens[i][0];
            int column = queens[i][1];
            board[row][column] = 1;
        }

        int[] dirs = {-1, 0, 1};
        for (int dr : dirs) {
            for (int dc : dirs) {
                if (dr == 0 && dc == 0) continue;
                int row = r + dr;
                int col = l + dc;
                while (row >= 0 && row < 8 && col >= 0 && col < 8) {
                    if (board[row][col] == 1) {
                        res.add(Arrays.asList(row, col));
                        break;
                    }
                    row += dr;
                    col += dc;
                }
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. Iterate through the coordinates of queens and mark the positions on the board as 1.
2. Use nested loops over the direction offsets to search in all possible directions from the king.
3. Traverse the board in each direction to find the attacking queens and add them to the result list.

This approach ensures that we properly traverse the board and check all possible attacking positions from the king, fixing the bug in the original code.
