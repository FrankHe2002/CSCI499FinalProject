The given code is trying to find the maximum distance between two houses with different colors. It initializes two pointers (l and r) to the start and end of the array, then it iterates to find the first and last different color. Finally, it calculates the maximum distance based on the positions of l and r.

The bug in the code is that the return statement is not calculating the correct maximum distance. It should be using the absolute difference between r and l to represent the maximum distance, rather than using Math.max(r, colors.length - l - 1).

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] colors) {
        int l = 0, r = colors.length - 1;
        while (colors[l] == colors[0]) l++;
        while (colors[r] == colors[colors.length - 1]) r--;
        return Math.max(r - l, 0);
    }
}
```
