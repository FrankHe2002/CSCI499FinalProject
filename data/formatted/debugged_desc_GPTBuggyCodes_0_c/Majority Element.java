The code provided has a bug. The bug is that the code does not correctly identify the majority element in the array. The code sorts the array in descending order and returns the element at index `nums.length / 2`, thinking it will be the majority element due to sorting, but this is incorrect. 

To fix this issue, we need to implement a different algorithm to find the majority element. One possible solution is to use Moore's Voting Algorithm to find the majority element in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        Integer candidate = null;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }
            count += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
        }
        
        return candidate;
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, we loop through the array and use the `count` variable to keep track of the majority element. If the count becomes zero, we update the `candidate` to the current element. Then, for each subsequent element, we either increment or decrement the count based on whether the current element matches the candidate. After looping through the entire array, the `candidate` will hold the majority element, and we return it. This algorithm ensures linear time complexity and O(1) space complexity, as required.
