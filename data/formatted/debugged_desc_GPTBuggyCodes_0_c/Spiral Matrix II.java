The given Java code is attempting to generate an n x n matrix in spiral order with elements from 1 to n^2. The code consists of a while loop and four for loops to iterate through the matrix in four different directions: right, down, left, and up.

Upon reviewing the code, there is a logical bug in the generation of the spiral matrix. When writing the elements in the upward direction, it overwrites the previously written value for the starting row element.

The issue is in the fourth for loop. It should be updating the matrix with `matrix[startingRow][i]` rather than `matrix[i][startingCol]`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the fourth for loop to write elements in the correct position.

Here is the updated code with the bug fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] generateMatrix(int n) {
        int startingRow = 0;
        int endingRow = n - 1;
        int startingCol = 0;
        int endingCol = n - 1;

        int total = n * n;
        int element = 1;
        int[][] matrix = new int[n][n];

        while (element <= total) {

            for (int i = startingCol; element <= total && i <= endingCol; i++) {
                matrix[startingRow][i] = element;
                element++;
            }
            startingRow++;

            for (int i = startingRow; element <= total && i <= endingRow; i++) {
                matrix[i][endingCol] = element;
                element++;
            }
            endingCol--;

            for (int i = endingCol; element <= total && i >= startingCol; i--) {
                matrix[endingRow][i] = element;
                element++;
            }
            endingRow--;

            for (int i = endingRow; element <= total && i >= startingRow; i--) {
                matrix[i][startingCol] = element;
                element++;
            }
            startingCol++;

        }

        return matrix;
    }
}
```
