Bug type: Array Index Out of Bounds

Reasoning:
1. The given code is calculating the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the ith box.
2. It uses two nested loops to iterate through each box and its adjacent boxes, then calculates the number of operations required to move the balls to the current box.
3. The inner loop iterates from 0 to n+1, where n is the length of the boxes string.
4. However, the inner loop should only iterate from 0 to n-1 to access the valid indices of the string.

The fix involves changing the inner loop condition to iterate from 0 to n-1.

Fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length();
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int t = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                char c = boxes.charAt(j);
                if (c == '1') t += Math.abs(i - j);
            }
            ans[i] = t;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
