Bug Type:
The code logic is incorrect.

Reasoning:
Upon reviewing the code, we can see that the rec() function returns the list of distances of leaf nodes from the root. The result of the operation `i + j <= dist` does not consider the length of the path. It only counts the number of leaf node pairs in left and right sub-trees whose distance is less than or equal to `dist`.

The fix to the bug will be to keep track of the path length from the root to the leaf node, then calculate the total distance between the leaf nodes and the root. If this total distance is less than or equal to `dist`, then the pair of leaf nodes will be counted in the result. The solution should use HashMap to store the distance of leaf nodes from the root and perform a DFS traversal to find the distance of each leaf node from the root.

The fixed code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    static int res;

    public int countPairs(TreeNode root, int distance) {
        res = 0;
        rec(root, distance);
        return res;
    }

    static Map<Integer, Integer> rec(TreeNode root, int dist) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> distances = new HashMap<>();
        if (root == null) {
            return distances;
        }
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            distances.put(0, 1);
            return distances;
        }
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> left = rec(root.left, dist);
        Map<Integer, Integer> right = rec(root.right, dist);
        
        for (int ld : left.keySet()) {
            for (int rd : right.keySet()) {
                if (ld + rd + 2 <= dist) {
                    res += left.get(ld) * right.get(rd);
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (int ld : left.keySet()) {
            distances.put(ld + 1, left.get(ld));
        }
        for (int rd : right.keySet()) {
            distances.put(rd + 1, distances.getOrDefault(rd + 1, 0) + right.get(rd));
        }
        
        return distances;
    }
}
```
In the fixed code, we use a HashMap to store the distance of leaf nodes from the root, and then we update the result based on the distance pairs of left and right sub-trees.
