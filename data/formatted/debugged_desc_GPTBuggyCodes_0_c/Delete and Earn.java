The code provided appears to have a few potential issues:

1. The `Arrays` class is not imported, so the code could produce a compilation error.
2. The logic inside the for loop is a little hard to follow and it's not clear if the code is correctly implementing the described problem.

To address these potential issues, the following changes can be made to the code:

1. Import the `Arrays` class to fix the potential compilation error.
2. Revisit the logic inside the for loop to ensure that it accurately determines the maximum number of points that can be earned.

Here is the modified code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int[] sumArray = new int[10001];
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sumArray[num] += num;
        }
        
        int onePreviousAgo = 0;
        int previous = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < sumArray.length; i++) {
            int temp = previous;
            previous = Math.max(previous, onePreviousAgo + sumArray[i]);
            onePreviousAgo = temp;
        }
        
        return previous;
    }
}
```

In this modified code:
- The `Arrays` class is imported to avoid potential compilation errors.
- The logic inside the for loop has been rewritten to better capture the maximum number of points that can be earned. It uses an additional array `sumArray` to store the sum of numbers, and then calculates the maximum points earned.

These changes should address potential issues with the original code.
