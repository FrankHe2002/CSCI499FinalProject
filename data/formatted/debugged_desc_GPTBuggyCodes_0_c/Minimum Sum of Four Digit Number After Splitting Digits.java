The given code takes a positive integer with four digits and splits the number into two new integers, then returns the minimum possible sum of the new integers.

Let's review the code for potential bugs or issues:

1. The code will result in an error if the input is not a four-digit number.
2. There is no check to verify that the input meets the constraints.
3. The sorting of the digits seems to be incorrect as it might lead to an incorrect answer.

Let's address these potential issues step by step:

1. To address the first issue, we will need to add a check to ensure that the input is a four-digit number. If the input does not meet this criterion, the method should return an error message.

2. To address the second issue, we will add a validation check at the beginning of the method to ensure that the input integer is within the specified constraints.

3. The third issue involves the sorting of the digits. Currently, the code sorts the digits and then forms two new integers. However, this may not always result in the minimum possible sum of new1 and new2.

Here's the updated code with the identified issues addressed:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumSum(int num) {
        if (num < 1000 || num > 9999) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input must be a four-digit number");
        }
        
        int[] dig = new int[4];
        int cur = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            dig[cur++] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(dig);
        
        int num1 = (dig[0] * 10) + dig[1];
        int num2 = (dig[2] * 10) + dig[3];
        
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

In the updated code, we have added a validation check for the input and modified the calculation of num1 and num2 to form the two new integers with the minimum possible sum.
