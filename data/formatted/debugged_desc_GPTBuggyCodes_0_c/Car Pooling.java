The code looks good at first glance, but given the condition that the vehicle only drives east, it is likely that the logic is incorrect. Let's analyze the code in more detail.

The code initializes a TreeMap to keep track of the passengers at different destinations, which is a good approach. Then it iterates through the trips and updates the TreeMap based on the pickup and drop-off locations. Finally, it checks if the total passengers exceed the capacity anywhere in the trip and returns false if it does.

The bug in the code is that the logic does not account for picking up passengers after dropping off passengers at previous locations. The code simply checks if the total passengers exceed the capacity at any point during the trip, but it doesn't consider the order of the trips and the cumulative effect of pickups and drop-offs.

To fix this, we can revise the logic to account for the cumulative effect of pickups and drop-offs. We need to sort the trips based on the pickup locations and then process them in a sequential manner.

Here's the updated code with minimal changes:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.TreeMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> destinationToPassengers = new TreeMap<>();
        
        Arrays.sort(trips, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]); // Sort the trips based on pickup locations
        
        for (int[] trip : trips) {
            int currPassengersAtPickup = destinationToPassengers.getOrDefault(trip[1], 0);
            destinationToPassengers.put(trip[1], currPassengersAtPickup + trip[0]);
            
            int currPassengersAtDrop = destinationToPassengers.getOrDefault(trip[2], 0);
            destinationToPassengers.put(trip[2], currPassengersAtDrop - trip[0]);
        }

        int currPassengers = 0;
        for (int passengers : destinationToPassengers.values()) {
            currPassengers += passengers;

            if (currPassengers > capacity) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

In the modified code, we have sorted the trips array based on the pickup locations using `Arrays.sort` and a custom comparator. This ensures that the trips are processed in the correct order.

With this change, we have fixed the bug by ensuring that the cumulative effect of pickups and drop-offs is correctly accounted for.

The rest of the code remains the same, maintaining the TreeMap to keep track of passengers at different locations and checking if the capacity is exceeded at any point during the trip.
