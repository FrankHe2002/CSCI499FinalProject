Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is attempting to calculate the minimum cost of cutting the wooden stick, given the lengths of the stick and the positions for the cuts.
2. The initial setup, including sorting the array of cuts and setting up the 2D array for dynamic programming, seems to be correct.
3. The problem arises in the `cut` function, where the calculation for the cost appears to be incorrect, and it uses the `cuts` array instead of the `arr` array.

The fix involves making sure to reference the correct array (`arr`) when calculating the cost for each possible cut position. Additionally, the base case and returning the `dp` values need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minCost(int n, int[] cuts) {
        int len = cuts.length;
        Arrays.sort(cuts);
        int[] arr = new int[len + 2];
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++)
            arr[i] = cuts[i - 1];

        arr[0] = 0;
        arr[len + 1] = n;
        int[][] dp = new int[len + 2][len + 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < len + 2; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], -1);
        }
        return cut(arr, 0, len + 1, dp);
    }

    int cut(int[] cuts, int i, int j, int[][] dp) {
        if (j - i <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) {
            return dp[i][j];
        }

        int mini = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
            int cost = cuts[j] - cuts[i] + cut(cuts, i, k, dp) + cut(cuts, k, j, dp);
            mini = Math.min(cost, mini);
        }

        return dp[i][j] = mini;
    }
}
```

The changes made include:
1. Correcting the base case condition in the cut function.
2. Using the `arr` array inside the `cut` function for calculating the cost.
3. Adjusting the 2D array initialization to include the extra spaces and using `Arrays.fill` to set all elements to -1.

This revised code should correctly calculate the minimum total cost of the cuts.
