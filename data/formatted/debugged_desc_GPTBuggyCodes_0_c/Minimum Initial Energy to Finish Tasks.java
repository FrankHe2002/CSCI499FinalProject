The provided Java code is sorting the tasks array based on the difference between the minimum energy required and the actual amount of energy spent on the tasks. It then calculates the maximum initial energy required to complete the tasks in any order.

It appears that the code has a logical issue in the calculation of the maximum initial energy required. The line `sum += tasks[i][0] + 1;` should be `sum += tasks[i][0];` because adding 1 to the actual energy spent doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Also, the sorting logic seems a bit confusing and potentially incorrect due to the negated comparison. It's better to use `a[1] - a[0] - (b[1] - b[0])` for comparison.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

class Solution {
    public int minimumEffort(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                return (a[1] - a[0]) - (b[1] - b[0]);
            }
        });
        int sum = 0, max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, sum + tasks[i][1]);
            sum += tasks[i][0];
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```

With these changes, the logical issue with the calculation of initial energy and the sorting logic have been fixed. This amended code should now provide the correct minimum initial amount of energy needed to finish all the tasks.
