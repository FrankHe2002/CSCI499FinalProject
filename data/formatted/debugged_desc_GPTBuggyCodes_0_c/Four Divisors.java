Bug type:
1. Logical error: The `break` statement is causing the loop to terminate prematurely.

The process of identifying and fixing the bug:
1. The code logic for finding and summing up the divisors of the integers with exactly four divisors looks fine.
2. The issue is with the placement of the `break` statement. It is currently outside of the `if (count == 4)` block, which means the outer loop will only run once. This is likely causing incorrect results.
3. To fix this, the `break` statement needs to be placed inside the `if (count == 4)` block so that the loop doesn't terminate prematurely.

Fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumFourDivisors(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i * i <= val; i++) {
                if (val % i == 0) {
                    sum += i;
                    count++;
                    if (i != val / i) {
                        sum += val / i;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (count == 4) {
                res += sum;
                // move the break statement inside the if block
                break;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
