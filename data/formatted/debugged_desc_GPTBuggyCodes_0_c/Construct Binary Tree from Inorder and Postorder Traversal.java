The main issue with the provided Java code is that the `n` variable is being used to keep track of the index of values in the `po` array, but it's not being decremented appropriately. This results in the incorrect selection of nodes from the `postorder` traversal array.

To fix the bug, the `n` variable should not be decremented every time it's accessed in the `buildTree` method. Instead, a separate variable should be used to keep track of the index in the `postorder` array.

Here's the modified code with the bug fixes:

```java
class Solution {
    int[] io;
    int[] po;
    int postIndex; // New variable to keep track of the postorder index
    int n;

    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] inorder, int[] postorder) {
        this.n = inorder.length - 1;
        this.postIndex = postorder.length - 1; // Initialize the postorder index
        this.io = inorder;
        this.po = postorder;
        return buildTree(0, n);
    }

    public TreeNode buildTree(int low, int high) {
        if (postIndex < 0 || low > high) return null;
        int currNode = po[postIndex--]; // Decrement the postorder index
        int idxInInorder = low;
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(currNode);
        if (low == high) return root;

        while (io[idxInInorder] != currNode) idxInInorder++;
        root.right = buildTree(idxInInorder + 1, high);
        root.left = buildTree(low, idxInInorder - 1);
        return root;
    }
    
    // Main method and other helper methods remain unchanged
}
```

In this solution, a new variable `postIndex` is added to keep track of the index in the `postorder` array. This variable is decremented when accessing the `po` array in the `buildTree` method, ensuring that the correct nodes are selected.

As a result, this bug fix ensures that the binary tree is constructed accurately based on the provided inorder and postorder traversals.
