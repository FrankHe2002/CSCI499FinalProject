The given code is attempting to find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal by sorting the array, finding the median value, and then calculating the sum of the absolute differences between each element and the median value. However, the bug in the code is that it should be using the median value, not the value at the index `idx`. 
Additionally, we should be handling the case when the length of the array is even, the median value should be an average of the two middle values.

We can fix the bug by updating the `idx` calculation and using the median value to calculate the sum of absolute differences.

Here's the modified code with the bug fix:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int idx = (nums.length) / 2;
        int median;
        if (nums.length % 2 == 0) {
            median = (nums[idx - 1] + nums[idx]) / 2;
        } else {
            median = nums[idx];
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.abs(nums[i] - median);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
