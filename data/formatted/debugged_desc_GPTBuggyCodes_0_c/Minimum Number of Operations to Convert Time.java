The given code is meant to take two strings representing 24-hour times, convert them to minutes, find the difference, and then calculate the minimum number of operations needed to convert current to correct by adding 1, 5, 15, or 60 minutes at a time.

Let's try to identify potential issues:
1. The `convertTime` method calculates the difference between the times but the loop that processes this difference does not include the last value in the `order` array (1 minute) which could cause incorrect results.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int HHMMToMinutes(String s) {
        return Integer.parseInt(s.substring(0, 2)) * 60 + Integer.parseInt(s.substring(3, 5));
    }

    public int convertTime(String current, String correct) {
        int diff = HHMMToMinutes(correct) - HHMMToMinutes(current);
        int[] order = {60, 15, 5, 1};
        int i = 0;
        int ops = 0;
        while (i < 4) { // change while condition from 3 to 4 to include the last order
            ops += (diff / order[i]);
            diff %= order[i];
            i++;
        }
        return ops;
    }
}
```
