There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed in the provided code:

1. The code does not handle the case when a key has a count of 1 and needs to be incremented. It only handles the case when a key already exists in the data structure and needs to be incremented.

2. The `createNewBucket()` method is called on `bucketList` and `createBucketToTheRight()` method is called on `bucketList`. However, the `bucketList` object is not defined in the code snippet.

Here's the revised code with the identified issues fixed:

```java
public class AllOne {
    class Bucket {
        int count;
        Set<String> keys;

        public Bucket(int count) {
            this.count = count;
            keys = new HashSet<>();
        }
    }

    private final Map<String, Integer> stringToCount;
    private final TreeSet<Bucket> buckets;

    public AllOne() {
        stringToCount = new HashMap<>();
        buckets = new TreeSet<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a.count));
    }

    public void inc(String key) {
        int count = stringToCount.getOrDefault(key, 0);
        stringToCount.put(key, count + 1);

        if (count > 0) {
            Bucket currentBucket = findBucket(count);
            Bucket newBucket = findBucket(count + 1);

            currentBucket.keys.remove(key);
            newBucket.keys.add(key);
        } else {
            buckets.first().keys.add(key);
        }
    }

    public void dec(String key) {
        int count = stringToCount.get(key);
        if (count == 1) {
            stringToCount.remove(key);
            buckets.first().keys.remove(key);
        } else {
            stringToCount.put(key, count - 1);
            Bucket currentBucket = findBucket(count);
            Bucket newBucket = findBucket(count - 1);

            currentBucket.keys.remove(key);
            newBucket.keys.add(key);
        }
    }

    public String getMaxKey() {
        return buckets.isEmpty() ? "" : buckets.last().keys.iterator().next();
    }

    public String getMinKey() {
        return buckets.isEmpty() ? "" : buckets.first().keys.iterator().next();
    }

    private Bucket findBucket(int count) {
        for (Bucket bucket : buckets) {
            if (bucket.count == count) {
                return bucket;
            }
        }
        Bucket newBucket = new Bucket(count);
        buckets.add(newBucket);
        return newBucket;
    }
}
```

In the revised code:
- The `inc` and `dec` methods now correctly handle the increment and decrement of the key counts.
- `buckets` is used to store the `Bucket` objects, which are now defined as an inner class.
- The `findBucket` method is used to find a `Bucket` given its count, and if it does not exist, a new bucket is created and added to the `buckets` TreeSet.

With these changes, the identified issues have been addressed, and the code should now work as intended.
