The issue with the provided code is that it attempts to use separate helper functions to determine the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from two different starting points, which is not necessary. We can modify the code to handle both cases within the same helper function.

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        int[] t = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
            t[i] = -1;
        }
        return Math.max(helper(nums, 1, t), helper(nums, 0, t));
    }

    static int helper(int[] nums, int start, int[] t) {
        if (start == 0 && nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        if (start >= nums.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (t[start] != -1) {
            return t[start];
        }
        int pick = nums[start] + helper(nums, start + 2, t);
        int notpick = helper(nums, start + 1, t);
        t[start] = Math.max(pick, notpick);
        return t[start];
    }
}
```

In the updated code:
- The helper function now takes into account only the starting index and the array of numbers.
- The conditions to check for the end of the array are simplified.
- The check for the value of `t[start]` is corrected to ensure the correct value is returned.
- The combination of `start` and `i` in the original code is simplified to `start` in the updated code. This should work correctly for determining the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without raising the alarm.
