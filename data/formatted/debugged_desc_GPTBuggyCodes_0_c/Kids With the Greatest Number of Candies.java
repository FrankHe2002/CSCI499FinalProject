Bug type: Logical Error

Reasoning:
1. The code is intended to find if a kid, after receiving extraCandies, will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids. It does so by finding the highest number of candies and then checking if the kid's candies after adding extraCandies is greater than the highest - extraCandies, which is incorrect logic.
2. The logic to compare if the number of candies after adding extraCandies is greater than the highest - extraCandies is incorrect because it may result in wrong calculations. We simply need to check if adding extraCandies to the current kid's candies makes it the highest.

We can fix the issue by adjusting the comparison to simply check if the kid's candies after adding extraCandies is greater than or equal to the highest number of candies, without subtracting the extraCandies.

The corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>(candies.length);
        int theHighest = candies[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < candies.length; i++) {
            theHighest = Math.max(theHighest, candies[i]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
            if (candies[i] + extraCandies >= theHighest) {
                result.add(true);
            } else {
                result.add(false);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
