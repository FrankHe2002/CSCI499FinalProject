Bug type: Logic Error

The bug in the code is in the if statement when k is equal to 1. The code should be ensuring that the lexicographically smallest string is obtained after applying the mentioned step any number of moves. However, the current code does not achieve this.

To identify the bug, I will review the logic for k=1 and compare it with the requirements for the function. Then I will analyze the approach for k > 1.

The following is the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public String orderlyQueue(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        String ans = "";
        if (k == 1) {
            ans = s;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { // iterate through all possible rotations
                String candidate = s.substring(i) + s.substring(0, i);
                if (candidate.compareTo(ans) < 0) {
                    ans = candidate;
                }
            }
        } else {
            char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(arr);
            ans = String.valueOf(arr);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Changes made:
- In the if statement for k == 1, I set `ans` to the original string `s` and then iterate through all possible rotations to find the lexicographically smallest string.
- The `compareTo` method is used to compare candidate strings and update `ans` if a smaller lexicographical value is found.
