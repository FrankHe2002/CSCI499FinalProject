The bug in the provided code is in the outer for loop. It should be incrementing `i` instead of decrementing it.

Reasoning process:
1. The outer for loop initializes `i` to 0 and checks if `i` is less than `len`. This is correct.
2. The inner for loop initializes `j` to `i + 1` and checks if `j` is less than `len`. This is also correct.
3. The inner loop checks for `nums[i]` being equal to `nums[j]` and increments the `counter` if they are equal. This logic seems to be correct.
4. The bug is in the outer loop where `i` is being decremented instead of incremented, which causes the loop to become an infinite loop.

To fix the bug, we should change `i--` to `i++` in the outer for loop.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIdenticalPairs(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
                if (nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
```
