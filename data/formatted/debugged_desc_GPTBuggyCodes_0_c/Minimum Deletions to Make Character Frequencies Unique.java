The identified bug is that the while loop is not correctly checking for the presence of the current frequency in the set. The issue is that the while loop only decreases the frequency `i` and increases `ans` if the current frequency is already present in the set. However, it should also add the decreased frequency back to the set after decreasing it.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    private int N = 26;

    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        int[] array = new int[N];
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            array[ch - 97]++;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : array) {
            if (i == 0) continue;
            while (set.contains(i)) {
                i--;
                if (i == 0) break;
                ans++;
            }
            if (i != 0) {
                set.add(i);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Changes made:
- Added a condition to break from the while loop if `i` becomes 0.
- Moved the condition `if (i != 0)` inside the while loop to avoid adding 0 to the set.
