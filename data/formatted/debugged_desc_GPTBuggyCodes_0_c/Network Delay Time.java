Potential Bug: 
The code uses a value of 1000 as a placeholder for an unreachable node in the `timeReach` array. However, this may cause an issue as this value is used to calculate the final time, and if a real travel time is close to 1000, it could be mistakenly considered as unreachable.

Step-by-step Bug Identification and Fixing:
1. The current implementation uses a hardcoded value of 1000 to represent unreachable nodes in the `timeReach` array. This may cause issues if there are actual travel times close to 1000, leading to incorrect results.
2. To fix this, we can use a sentinel value representing "infinity" to initialize the `timeReach` array instead of a hardcoded value. This will ensure that any actual travel time is considered and no node is mistakenly considered unreachable.
3. After the BFS traversal, we can check if any node's `timeReach` value is still at the "infinity" sentinel value, indicating that the signal did not reach that node. If any such node is found, we can return -1 to indicate that it is impossible for all nodes to receive the signal.
4. Make these adjustments and ensure that the code still handles the case where it is impossible for all nodes to receive the signal, updating the result accordingly.

Here is the fixed code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Integer, Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();

    public int networkDelayTime(int[][] times, int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            map.put(i, new HashMap<>());
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < times.length; i++) {
            map.get(times[i][0]).put(times[i][1], times[i][2]);
        }
        int ans = BFS(k, n);

        return ans == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : ans;
    }

    public int BFS(int k, int n) {
        LinkedList<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        int[] timeReach = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(timeReach, Integer.MAX_VALUE);

        timeReach[k] = 0;

        queue.add(k);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int rv = queue.remove();
            for (int nbrs : map.get(rv).keySet()) {
                int t = map.get(rv).get(nbrs) + timeReach[rv];
                if (t < timeReach[nbrs]) {
                    timeReach[nbrs] = t;
                    queue.add(nbrs);
                }
            }
        }

        int maxTime = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            maxTime = Math.max(timeReach[i], maxTime);
        }

        return maxTime == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : maxTime;
    }
}
```
With these changes, the code now initializes `timeReach` with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` representing infinite time, and it handles the case where it is not possible for all nodes to receive the signal by returning -1.
