The code aims to count the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n. It implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark all non-prime numbers and count the remaining prime numbers.

Bug Type: Logic Error
The bug is in the for loop condition `i <= n`, which should be `i < n` to ensure that the loop iterates strictly less than n( i.e., from 2 to n-1).

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPrimes(int n) {
        boolean check[] = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (check[i] == false) {
                count++;
                for (int j = i; j < n; j += i) {
                    check[j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
