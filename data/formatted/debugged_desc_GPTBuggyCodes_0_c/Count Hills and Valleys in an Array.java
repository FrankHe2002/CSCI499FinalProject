The bug in the code is in the condition for checking whether an index is part of a hill or a valley. The logic to check for a hill or a valley is incorrect, which results in the wrong count of hills and valleys.

To identify and fix the bug, step through the code and analyze the conditional statements to see if they accurately capture when a hill or a valley is being encountered.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the original code:
1. Initialize the result count to 0 and start index to 1 while ignoring the elements in the array that are equal.
2. Start iterating through the array to check for hills and valleys.
3. Check if the current element is a hill or valley based on the previous and next elements.
4. Update the result count accordingly.

The issue lies in the conditional statements for identifying hills and valleys.

To fix the bug, the condition for identifying hills and valleys needs to be adjusted while iterating through the array.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countHillValley(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        int start = 1;
        while (start < nums.length && nums[start] == nums[start - 1])
            start++;

        int prev = start;
        for (int i = start; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1] && nums[i] > nums[i + 1])
                result++;
            if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1] && nums[i] < nums[i + 1])
                result++;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements have been updated to directly compare the current element (nums[i]) with its neighbors to check for hills and valleys. This should fix the bug and accurately count the number of hills and valleys in the given array.
