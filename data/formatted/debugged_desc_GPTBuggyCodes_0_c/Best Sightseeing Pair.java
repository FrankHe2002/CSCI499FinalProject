The given code is intended to find the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots according to the specified formula. 

Upon reviewing the code, it looks like the logic might contain a bug. The bug appears to be in the calculation of `ans` where `dp[i]` is added to `values[i] - i`. This does not align with the defined score formula.

To fix the bug:
- We need to update the calculation of `ans` to use the correct score formula `values[i] + values[j] + i - j`. 
- Since `dp[i]` represents the maximum value from `values[0]` to `values[i]`, we should iterate through the array again and calculate the score for each pair of sightseeing spots.

The updated code is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScoreSightseeingPair(int[] values) {
        int n = values.length;
        int maxPrev = values[0]; // maxPrev stores the maximum value of values[i] + i encountered so far
        int ans = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            ans = Math.max(ans, maxPrev + values[j] - j); // update ans by calculating the score for each pair
            maxPrev = Math.max(maxPrev, values[j] + j); // update maxPrev to store the maximum value found so far
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- Create a variable `maxPrev` to store the maximum value of `values[i] + i` encountered so far.
- Iterate through the array to calculate the score for each pair of sightseeing spots and update `ans` accordingly.
- Update `maxPrev` to store the maximum value found so far.
- Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.
