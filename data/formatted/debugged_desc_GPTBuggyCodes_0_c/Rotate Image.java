There is a bug in the code. The second for loop of the rotate() function is incorrect and should be modified.

The first for loop iterates over the first half of the rows of the matrix, swapping the elements with their corresponding elements in the last half of the rows. This step is correct for rotating the matrix 90 degrees.

The second for loop, however, iterates from n - 1 to 0 and is meant to swap the elements in a diagonal pattern. However, the inner loop is incorrect and should only iterate up to i - 1 (exclusive), not up to i.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void swap(int[][] matrix, int n1, int m1, int n2, int m2) {
        int temp = matrix[n1][m1];
        matrix[n1][m1] = matrix[n2][m2];
        matrix[n2][m2] = temp;
    }

    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                swap(matrix, i, j, n - i - 1, j);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                swap(matrix, i, j, j, i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
