The code is trying to calculate the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time. The main issue with the current code is that the probability is returning incorrect values. The helper() method is supposed to calculate the probability, but there seems to be an error in the logic used in the recursive calls.

The bug type is a logical error.

To fix the issue, I will correct the helper() method to calculate the probability correctly based on the given operations of serving soup. The following changes will be made to address the bug:

1. Calculate the probability based on the given operations of serving soup A and B.
2. Ensure that the base cases are handled properly to return the correct probability.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public double soupServings(int n) {
        if (n > 4800) return 1.0;
        n = (int) Math.ceil(n / 25.0);
        double[][] dp = new double[n + 1][n + 1];
        return helper(n, n, dp);
    }

    double helper(int a, int b, double[][] dp) {
        if (a <= 0 && b <= 0) return 0.5;
        if (a <= 0) return 1.0;
        if (b <= 0) return 0.0;
        if (dp[a][b] > 0) return dp[a][b];
        dp[a][b] = 0.25 * (helper(a - 4, b, dp) + helper(a - 3, b - 1, dp) + helper(a - 2, b - 2, dp) + helper(a - 1, b - 3, dp));
        return dp[a][b];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.soupServings(50));
    }
}
```

With these changes, the code should now correctly calculate the probability of the soup servings and provide the expected output.
