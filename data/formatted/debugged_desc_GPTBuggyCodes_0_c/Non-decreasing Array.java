The bug in the code is that it doesn't handle the specific case of a decreasing sequence with a single element that needs modification, for example, [3, 4, 2, 3].

To fix the issue:
- We would iterate through the array checking if the element at the current index is less than the previous element.
- If we find an element that is less than the previous one, we need to decide which element to modify to make the array non-decreasing.
- We can make the modification to the current element or the previous element.
- We count the number of modifications and if it is greater than 1, we return false.
- If the current index is greater than or equal to 2 and the  previous element at (index - 2) is greater than the current element, we break from the loop.
- If we didn't break from the loop, then the array is non-decreasing and we return true.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkPossibility(int[] nums) {
        int modified = 0;
        for (int index = 1; index < nums.length; ++index) {
            if (nums[index] < nums[index - 1]) {
                if (++modified > 1) return false;
                if (index - 2 >= 0 && nums[index - 2] > nums[index]) {
                    nums[index] = nums[index - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
