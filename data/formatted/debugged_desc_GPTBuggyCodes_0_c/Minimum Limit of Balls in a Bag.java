There is a bug in the while loop condition. The condition "min + 1 < max" should be "min < max" to properly perform the binary search.

The reasoning process for identifying the bug:
1. The while loop condition should check if the min and max values are equal instead of checking if min + 1 is less than max, so the condition should be "min < max".
2. The binary search algorithm should be updated to include the correct comparison for the count of operations and the mid value, so that we can properly update the min and max values in each iteration.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumSize(int[] nums, int maxOperations) {
        int min = 0;
        int max = 1000000000;
        while (min < max) {
            int mid = (max - min) / 2 + min;
            int count = 0;
            for (int a : nums) {
                count += (a - 1) / mid;
            }
            if (count <= maxOperations) {
                max = mid;
            } else {
                min = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
