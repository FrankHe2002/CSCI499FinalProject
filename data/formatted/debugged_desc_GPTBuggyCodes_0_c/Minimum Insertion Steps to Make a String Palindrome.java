Bug Type:
The bug in the provided code is a logical error.

Reasoning:
The bug type is a logical error because the implementation does not return the minimum number of steps to make the input string a palindrome. The LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm is used to compute the minimum number of insertions required to make a string a palindrome, but the algorithm is not correctly implemented.

Thinking process:
1. Verify the correctness of the LCS algorithm implementation by analyzing its logic.
2. If there's a bug, identify the root cause of the incorrect behavior.
3. Modify the LCS algorithm implementation to correctly calculate the number of insertions required to make the input string a palindrome.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the LCS algorithm implementation to find the length of the longest palindrome subsequence.
2. Calculate the difference between the length of the input string and the length of the palindrome subsequence to determine the minimum number of insertions.

The modified code is presented below:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minInsertions(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - len + 1; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
}
```

The revised implementation uses dynamic programming and correctly calculates the minimum number of insertions required to make the input string a palindrome.
