The code seems to be occupied with handling the start and end indices of the seated people, however, the calculation of the maximum distance seems to be off.

Let's go through the code and check for logic errors. 

1. The variable `start` is initialized as -1, which is fine.
2. The variable `end` is also initialized as -1, which is fine.
3. The loop iterates through the `seats` array and updates the `start` and `end` variables based on the seat occupied. The condition `if (start == - 1) max = i;` seems to be setting the initial max value to the index itself if it is the first person, which doesn't represent the maximum distance.
4. The calculation `max = Math.max((end - start) / 2, max);` seems to be attempting to calculate the maximum distance, but it doesn't take into account the edge cases or the actual distance between the seats properly.

It seems like the main issue exists in the calculation of the maximum distance. The bug type is a logical error.

Let's fix the bug by accurately calculating the maximum distance and handling edge cases.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
        int size = seats.length;
        int max = 0;
        int start = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (seats[i] == 1) {
                if (start == -1){
                    max = i;
                } else {
                    max = Math.max((i - start) / 2, max);
                }
                start = i;
            }
        }

        // Handle edge cases
        max = Math.max(max, size - 1 - start);
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

In the fixed code, we correctly calculate the maximum distance between occupied seats, handle edge cases, and return the maximum distance.
