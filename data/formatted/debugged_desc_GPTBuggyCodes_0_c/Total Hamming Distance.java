The given code calculates the total Hamming distance between all pairs of integers in the `nums` array. It uses a 2D array `cnt` to store the count of 0s and 1s at each bit position, and then uses these counts to calculate the total Hamming distance.

Upon careful examination, the bug in the code is that the `cnt` array is not being initialized. Since Java initializes arrays to all zeroes by default, we can assume that the `cnt` array is being initialized to all zeroes.

The fix for this bug is to initialize the `cnt` array explicitly at the beginning of the `totalHammingDistance` method. The `cnt` array should be initialized to all zeroes before the nested loops begin the counting process.

Here's the modified code with the fix:

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        int[][] cnt = new int[2][32];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
                int idx = (nums[i] >> j) & 1;
                total += cnt[idx ^ 1][j];
                cnt[idx][j]++;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

With this fix, the `cnt` array is properly initialized to all zeroes before the counting process begins. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
