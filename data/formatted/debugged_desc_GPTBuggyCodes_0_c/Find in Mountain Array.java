The provided Java code appears to contain a naming error. The variable referenced inside the conditional expression of the if statement in the findInMountainArray function is not declared. This might lead to a compilation error. Also, there's a potential issue with the binary search algorithm.

Let's walk through the code to identify the errors and fix them step-by-step:

1. The variable "right" used inside the conditional expression in the findInMountainArray function is not declared or initialized. We assume that it should be "right" instead of "left".

2. Another issue is the binary search algorithm. If the target number is found, we should simply return the index. Currently, the logic returns -1 in the binary function which is incorrect. The return value should be updated.

Here's the modified code with the identified issues fixed:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findInMountainArray(int target, MountainArray mountainArr) {
        int peak = findPeak(mountainArr);

        int left = binary(0, peak, mountainArr, target, true);
        if (left != -1) {  // Fixed variable reference
            return left;
        }
        int right = binary(peak + 1, mountainArr.length() - 1, mountainArr, target, false);
        return right;
    }

    static int findPeak(MountainArray mountainArr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = mountainArr.length() - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + ((end - start) / 2);
            if (mountainArr.get(mid) < mountainArr.get(mid + 1)) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }

    static int binary(int low, int high, MountainArray arr, int target, boolean left) {
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);
            if (target < arr.get(mid)) {
                if (left) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else if (target > arr.get(mid)) {
                if (left) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            } else {
                return mid;  // Return mid when target is found
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

With these changes, the code should now correctly identify the variables and return the correct index when the target is found in the mountain array.
