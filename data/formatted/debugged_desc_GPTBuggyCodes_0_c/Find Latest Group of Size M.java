The current implementation seems to use disjoint sets to calculate the count of consecutive 1 bits. However, this approach is incorrect as it does not consider the contiguous groups of 1's in the binary string. The issue seems to lie in the implementation of the union and find functions used to calculate the size of the consecutive 1 bits.

Upon reviewing the code, I can see that the count array is being used to keep track of the number of elements in each disjoint set. If a set is extended by adding another element, the count of the new set and the old set have to be updated. However, this approach does not seem to consider the actual contiguous groups of 1's in the binary string.

Additionally, the findLatestStep function does not seem to correctly identify the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length exactly m.

To fix this issue, the counting of consecutive 1 bits needs to be re-implemented. Instead of using disjoint sets, a more straightforward approach should be utilized to calculate the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length m.

We can use a HashMap to store the length of the consecutive groups of 1's, and then iterate through the array to update this HashMap for each bit set to 1.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int findLatestStep(int[] arr, int m) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] length = new int[n + 2];
        int[] count = new int[n + 1];
        int ans = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int idx = arr[i];
            int left = length[idx - 1];
            int right = length[idx + 1];
            length[idx - left] = length[idx + right] = left + right + 1;
            count[left]--;
            count[right]--;
            count[left + right + 1]++;
            if (count[m] > 0) {
                ans = i + 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

With this corrected code, the length of the consecutive groups of 1's is updated directly based on the value of the previous and next bits. This approach is simpler and more effective for solving the given problem.
