The bug in the provided code is due to the loop condition in the for loop. The loop should iterate until `i < patterns.length` rather than `i <= patterns.length`. As a result, the code will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `i` reaches the value of `patterns.length`.

To fix the bug, the loop condition should be updated to `i < patterns.length`.

Here is the updated code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfStrings(String[] patterns, String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < patterns.length; i++) {
            if (word.contains(patterns[i])) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
