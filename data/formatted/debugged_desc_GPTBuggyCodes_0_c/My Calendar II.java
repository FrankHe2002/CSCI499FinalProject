The code looks plausible, but we will check for the possible types of bugs and implement the required fix if needed.

Bug type:
The code seems prone to the bug type of incorrectly identifying double bookings due to inefficient logic implementation.

Fix:
We need to revise the logic that identifies double bookings to ensure that the correct pairs are checked and added.

Updated code:
```java
class MyCalendarTwo {
    private List<int[]> bookings;
    private List<int[]> doubleBookings;

    public MyCalendarTwo() {
        bookings = new ArrayList<>();
        doubleBookings = new ArrayList<>();
    }


    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] b : doubleBookings) {
            if (start < b[1] && end > b[0])
                return false;
        }

        for (int[] b : bookings) {
            int overlapStart = Math.max(start, b[0]);
            int overlapEnd = Math.min(end, b[1]);
            if (overlapStart < overlapEnd) {
                if (hasTripleBooking(overlapStart, overlapEnd)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        bookings.add(new int[] {start, end});
        return true;
    }

    private boolean hasTripleBooking(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] b : doubleBookings) {
            if (start < b[1] && end > b[0]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        doubleBookings.add(new int[] {start, end});
        return true;
    }
}
```
