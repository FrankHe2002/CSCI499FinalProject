The code has a bug in the while loop where the result is being updated and added with the sum in each iteration. This is not the expected behavior as per the problem description. 

The initial problem is that the result string needs to be updated inside the while loop. The sum of the digits of the result needs to be calculated 'k' times.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int getLucky(String s, int k) {

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
            sb.append((s.charAt(i) - 'a') + 1);
        String result = sb.toString();

        int sum = 0;
        while (k-- > 0) {
            sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < result.length(); i++)
                sum += Character.getNumericValue(result.charAt(i));

            result = String.valueOf(sum);
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```
